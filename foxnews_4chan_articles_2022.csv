New York and Florida have both recorded their highest-ever single-day total of new COVID-19 cases in recent days as new cases surge all over the United States.

New York set a record of 85,476 cases on Saturday, breaking the state's record set just days earlier. The surge in cases came amid high numbers of testing.

Florida recorded 75,900 cases on Dec. 31, marking the fourth time in seven days that Florida has broken its record, which has raised the 7-day average to 42,600 - twice as much as this past summer’s surge thanks to the delta variant.

OMICRON VARIANT MAY IMPACT LUNGS DIFFERENTLY, STUDIES SAY

Florida usually only reports numbers on a Friday, but it feeds daily numbers to the CDC, which is where the new numbers came from. The Florida Department of Health will remain closed throughout the New Year’s holiday weekend, meaning new numbers will not be available until the following week, WFLA reported.

OMICRON LOOKS TO BRING IN NEW YEAR WITH HIGHEST CASELOADS RECORDED YET

The omicron variant has driven the new surge as it has in most parts of the country, resulting in a desperate need for testing. Florida residents have formed long lines in many areas, with wait times so long that at least three people have collapsed while standing in line.

Three people waiting at the Al Lopez Park testing site collapsed Friday, requiring immediate medical attention. One person left before the medics arrived, and the other two were women in their 60s – both with a history of blood pressure issues.

New testing sites have opened in the meantime to help with the sharp increase in demand.

New Jersey, California, and Texas have also seen surges in COVID-19 cases driven by the omicron variant.

President-elect Joe Biden, during the Obama administration, said the U.S. benefits from a “constant” and “unrelenting” stream of immigration -- and that those with white European heritage becoming a minority in the U.S. is ""a source of our strength.""

Biden, then the vice president, made the comments at a 2015 White House summit on “Countering Violent Extremism.” In those remarks Biden described the U.S. as a nation of immigrants and a “melting pot.”

BIDEN'S PICKS FOR TRANSITION TEAM THE LATEST SIGN OF A RADICALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION

""It is the ultimate source of our strength, it is the ultimate source of who we are, what we become,” he told roundtable participants. “It started all the way back in the late 1700s. There has been a constant, unrelenting stream of immigration, not in little trickles but in large numbers.”

He spoke of a conversation he had with former Singapore President Lee Kuan Yew. The former president told Biden that China was looking for a metaphorical “buried black box” -- or the secret that allows “America to constantly be able to remake itself, unlike any other country in the world.""

Biden said that he believed there were two parts to that “black box” -- one was an “overwhelming skepticism for orthodoxy.”

“There is a second thing in that black box: an unrelenting stream of immigration, nonstop, nonstop,” he said.

He went on to comment about potential demographic change in the U.S.

TRUMP OFFICIALS WARN OF NEW BORDER SURGE IF BIDEN REVERSES IMMIGRATION POLICIES

“Folks like me who are Caucasian, of European descent, for the first time in 2017 we’ll be in an absolute minority in the United States of America, absolute minority,” he said.

“Fewer than 50% of the people in America from then and on will be white European stock,"" he said. “That’s not a bad thing, that’s a source of our strength.""

Biden made similar comments a year earlier, where he reportedly spoke to the National Association of Manufacturers on the need for immigration reform “from a purely economic point of view.”

According to The Hill, which reported on the comments, Biden said a key to U.S. economic strength is the “constant, unrelenting stream” of immigrants into the country.

“Not dribbling,” Biden said. “Significant flows.”

Biden has promised to take a different, more open stance on immigration compared to the Trump administration's. Among his proposed policies are significantly raising the refugee cap, expanding the number of temporary visas, creating a “pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants, and eliminating the limits on employment-based visas by country.",https://www.foxnews.com

Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis accompanied his wife to her cancer treatment while critics were accusing the governor of taking a vacation as coronavirus cases spiked, Fox News has learned.

A DeSantis spokesperson said the governor accompanied wife Casey to cancer treatment Dec. 29, the day several left-wing critics accused the governor of ""missing.""

Democratic Mayor Jerry Demings of Orange County in Florida criticized DeSantis in a press conference Tuesday amid the rising COVID cases, suggesting state residents ""should be outraged"" with DeSantis not being in front of the media during the spike.

""Our residents, all Florida residents should be outraged, and they should ask the question, 'Now, where's our state? Where's our governor?'"" Demings said . ""Where is Ron DeSantis now? When was the last time you saw the governor do a press briefing regarding COVID-19?""

Others, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., took to social media to criticize DeSantis and accuse him of being ""inexplicably missing.""

""Hasn’t Gov. DeSantis been inexplicably missing for like 2 weeks,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a tweet during a visit to Florida. ""If he’s around, I would be happy to say hello. His social media team seems to have been posting old photos for weeks.""

""In the meantime, perhaps I could help with local organizing,"" added Ocasio-Cortez, who was spotted maskless while drinking and dining outdoors in the Sunshine State. ""Folks are quite receptive here.""

MSNBC host Joy Reid also lashed out at DeSantis, writing in a tweet: ""A governor, not governing during a crisis; and sunning his belly on vacation instead. @GovRonDeSantis is the Nero of Ted Cruzes.""

DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw responded to Reid, attaching photos of DeSantis' daily schedule, and asked, ""Have you ever considered that you’re one of the reasons nobody trusts the media?""



DeSantis communications staffer Kyle Lamb also responded to critics on Twitter who were questioning whether DeSantis was on vacation, writing: ""Just FYI, [DeSantis] is not on vacation. Literally no one from our office has said that he is.

Hollywood stars are taking a stand.

On Monday night, Minnesota resident George Floyd, an African-American man, died at the age of 46 after a white police officer pinned his knee against Floyd's neck, while he struggled for air and begged for his life.

As footage of the incident spread around the Internet, protests broke out in Minneapolis, resulting in many arrests in the city.

HARRY CONNICK JR., BRAD PITT AND MORE STARS TEAM UP FOR UPCOMING GRAMMYS SPECIAL TO HONOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS

Since numerous arrests have been made, celebrities have come forward, offering donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to bailing out low-income individuals, per their website.

On Thursday, a Twitter user announced that they'd donated $50 to the fund, urging followers to do the same.

After a long chain of announcements, Hollywood stars Steve Carell, Seth Rogen and Ben Schwartz all tweeted that they had ""matched"" the donation.

Floyd's death was also proceeded earlier in the day by a viral video showing a white woman calling the police on an African-American man after he asked her to leash her dog in New York City's Central Park.

During the 911 call, the woman told dispatchers that she was being ""threatened"" and distinguished the man's race.

4,"Just one year after defund the police cuts, Portland mayor calls for big budget increase",Emma Colton,"

A year after Portland cut funds to its police department amid defund the police protests, Mayor Ted Wheeler announced Wednesday he is seeking more than $5 million this fall for police investments, including hiring more officers and buying body-worn cameras.

""Many Portlanders no longer feel safe in their city,"" Wheeler said during a news conference Wednesday. ""Business owners have closed up shop, for fear of doing business in high risk areas. Commuters fear for their safety, whether taking public transport or going by foot. Parents are scared to let their children play outside.""

Portland has seen its most violent year, with a record number of 72 homicides, surpassing its previous full-year record of 66 in 1987. Nationally, homicides increased by nearly 30% from 2019 to 2020, based on FBI data. In Portland, deadly violence increased at a faster rate than nearly all major cities, with an 83% increase in homicides in 2020.

'DEFUND THE POLICE' LOSES BIG IN DEMOCRATIC CITIES NATIONWIDE

Starting in the fiscal year 2023, Wheeler said he wants to increase the police bureau’s staffing numbers by 300 officers — 200 sworn officers and 100 unarmed public safety specialists — over the next three years.

To attract more officers to the force, Wheeler is proposing $25,000 signing bonuses to the first 50 officers or public safety specialists. He is also supporting hiring back 25 retired police officers.

SEATTLE POLICE UNION LAMBASTS MAYOR FOR $25K OFFICER HIRING BONUSES AFTER PUSHING DEFUND MOVEMENT

""Our police bureau staffing levels are at record lows and based on projected retirements, staffing levels will continue (to decrease) unless we take decisive action now,"" Wheeler said.

Since August 2020, about 200 officers have left the department. Many, in their exit interviews, cited low morale, lack of support from city officials and burnout from months of racial justice protests, which often ended in plumes of tear gas before largely dying down last fall.

Currently, the Portland Police Department is around 130 officers below its authorized strength.

As Portland has reached more than 1,000 shootings this year, some residents, bystanders injured by gunfire and city leaders say the police are struggling to keep the city safe. Portland also saw repeated riots in the summer of 2020 following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis while he was in police custody, which reignited calls to defund the police and led to national protests.

Nationally, there was a 45% increase in the retirement rate and a nearly 20% increase in resignations from officers in 2020-2021 compared to the previous year, according to a June survey from the Police Executive Research Forum .

Smaller police departments across the country have suffered with staffing issues in the past year after larger cities such as New York City, Seattle and Los Angeles cut funds to police departments. The staffing shortages are currently being complicated by vaccine mandates implemented in cities, which have caused some officers to leave their positions or be fired for not complying.

Wheeler's announcement comes after defund the police candidates lost in elections across the country this week.

Seattle and New York City both had mayoral elections on Tuesday, with Seattle showing a strong lead for pro-police candidate Bruce Harrell, and New York City electing Democrat and former police captain, Eric Adams. While voters in Minneapolis rejected a proposed amendment to the city's charter that would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a Department of Public Safety.

5,"Victor Davis Hanson: The dangerous, diminishing power of the independent American citizen",Victor Davis Hanson,"

The last two years seem to have been one continual crisis—well aside from the coronavirus pandemic.

The spiraling prices of cars, gas, appliances, lumber, homes, and food are revisiting the miseries of the 1970s.

Anarchy defines the border.

A new divisive tribalism centers on ""critical race theory.""

ACTIVIST WHO RECORDED SINEMA IN ASU BATHROOM DEFENDS ACTIONS, ACCUSES CRITICS OF BEING 'TONE POLICE'

Unelected Washington grandees in the CIA, FBI, IRS, NSA, and Pentagon—like John Brennan, James Comey, Lois Lerner, Gen. Mark Milley, and Robert Mueller—feign ignorance or mislead under oath—or even break or ignore laws without consequences.

Ancient customs and laws are under assault from the Electoral College to the century-and-a-half make-up of the Supreme Court.

The current administration looks to the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the Paris Climate Accord for answers to America’s problems.

What is going on?

PROGRESSIVES SAY THEY’LL PASS INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECONCILIATION; ‘WE’RE GOING TO GET IT DONE’

All of these daily melodramas are the natural dividends of the diminishing power of the independent American citizen—politically, economically, socially, and culturally. Citizens are becoming inert, as radical ideas take root that our Founders never envisioned.

Again, what once distinguished Western democracies in general and the American republic in particular was robust citizenship.

A chauvinistic and broad middle class checked the privilege and leverage of the rich. Yet it lacked the dependencies—and often the envy—of the poor. The middle class was economically autonomous. Its ensuing empowerment ruled the electorate.

Americans once saw the physical space of the United States as both sacred and as their own laboratory of democracy. Immigrants arrived in diverse and legal fashion. As guests, all newcomers expected to be integrated and assimilated into the American civic identity.

America was one of the few successful multiracial and multiethnic democracies in history. And Americans came to accept, through civic education and constant self-criticism, that the ancient and global plague of tribalism led only to national oblivion.

BIDEN IN UN SPEECH SAYS US 'NOT SEEKING' NEW COLD WAR WITH CHINA, MILITARY MUST BE 'TOOL OF LAST RESORT'

So, they took up the hard work of achieving the vision of Martin Luther King, Jr. that our characters, not our race, is what matters.

There were other challenges to citizenship as the country grew powerful and rich. A huge government bureaucracy insidiously has appropriated power from elected officials to ""improve""—but as often to damage—the lives of Americans.

Because these administrators of a permanent state posed as our paternal benefactors, few citizens at first objected to the vast increases in taxes and non-elected functionaries.

But soon citizens began worrying that the unelected of our bureaucracies had combined the role of the judicial, executive, and legislative branches. So often government grandees acted as judges, juries, and executioners when their regulations, order, fines, and punishments bulldozed vulnerable citizens without the resources of the state.

More formally, our professional legal, academic, and politically active elitists have lost faith in the ancient customs and the Constitution itself. They loath the fact that our traditions have privileged individual liberty over a government-coerced equality of result.

Over the last two years, we have seen progressive efforts to end the 233-year-old Electoral college and constitutional guarantees to the states to set their own voting protocols during national elections. The 150-year-old nine-justice Supreme Court, the 180-year-old senate filibuster, and the 60-year-old notion of a 50-state union, are all likewise now under assault.

Apparently, the Left feels these customs and laws impede our fated march to radical socialist democracy—or more likely the rule of what 51 percent of the people prefer on any given day.

Globalization over the last half-century has created two Americans. One is of limited government red states whose manufacturing, assembly, and processing plants were shipped overseas or closed. In contrast, privileged bicoastal elites of the blue states became fabulously rich on new multibillion dollar markets for their legal, academic, financial, investment, and technological expertise.

Soon politics followed the money. And today our governing and professional classes often feel more at home with global norms—various UN commissions, European Union social mores, and the dictates of the World Health Organization or of the International Criminal Court—than they do with those of their own fellow Americans.

Yet if we were to restore the original idea of empowered citizens, then many of our current crises would disappear.

The mother of 5-year-old Kamarie Holland had allegedly sold her daughter as a sex slave before the young girl turned up dead in Alabama, newly made public court documents reveal.

The disturbing revelation comes three weeks after 35-year-old Kristy Marie Siple delivered a tearful performance to local news cameras claiming she woke up early on Dec. 13 to find the door to her Columbus, Georgia home open and her only daughter missing.

The girl’s body was found later that same night in an abandoned home in Phenix City, Alabama and a 37-year-old suspect – Jeremy Tremain Williams – was taken into custody after authorities nabbed him at a nearby motel.

GEORGIA MOM ARRESTED ON FELONY MURDER 2 WEEKS AFTER SUSPECT IN 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER'S SLAYING

Eventually arrested too last week, the girl’s mother, who also goes by Kristy Hoskins, has been charged with murder during a kidnapping, murder during rape, murder during sodomy and human trafficking, according to a warrant recently obtained by AL.com.

The document alleges Siple knowingly subjected another person to labor servitude or sexual servitude.

""She did agree with another person to pay her for having sexual intercourse and sodomy with her minor daughter,’’ the warrant states.

After Siple’s arrest Tuesday, Holland’s father issued a statement to WRBL.

""The amount of pain Kristy has caused by ripping Kamarie out of our lives will never cease,"" Corey Holland said. ""We are glad to see that she has been arrested. We are one step closer to justice for Kamarie. It’s our hope that justice is served. Kristy should receive whatever the maximum penalty she can get.""

""She’s a monster. A real mother protects and would die for her children,"" he continued. ""Kristy is a monster. My family and I will continue to wrestle with the loss of losing our angel Kamarie. We will ask that you continue to make your news about her and the justice she deserves.""

Williams is charged with capital murder of a child under the age of 14 over Holland’s death and could be facing additional counts, according to authorities. He has a lengthy history of alleged crimes against children, Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor has previously disclosed.

Warrants against both Williams and Siple indicate Holland died by asphyxiation from a ligature.

After her daughter was found dead across state lines, Siple spoke to WTVM for a tearful interview denying she had anything to do with Holland’s disappearance. Siple said her daughter’s father, Corey Holland, had custody, but the girl was staying the weekend with her when she disappeared.

""I’m a mommy. I did not have nothing to do with this,"" Siple told the news outlet, shedding tears. ""She was my life. I lived for her daily. She was my only girl. I have 3 boys and her.""

Williams was charged with child abuse in 2009 in Phenix City but was acquitted by a jury in 2012. He was also charged with child abuse in Columbus – though the outcome of the case wasn’t known – and was also the suspect in the slaying of a 1-year-old boy in Alaska but was never formally charged.

9,Dems deploying DARPA-funded AI-driven information warfare tool to target pro-Trump accounts,Gregg Re,"

An anti-Trump Democratic-aligned political action committee advised by retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal is planning to deploy an information warfare tool that reportedly received initial funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon’s secretive research arm -- transforming technology originally envisioned as a way to fight ISIS propaganda into a campaign platform to benefit Joe Biden.

The Washington Post first reported that the initiative, called Defeat Disinfo, will utilize ""artificial intelligence and network analysis to map discussion of the president’s claims on social media,"" and then attempt to ""intervene"" by ""identifying the most popular counter-narratives and boosting them through a network of more than 3.4 million influencers across the country — in some cases paying users with large followings to take sides against the president.""

Social media guru Curtis Hougland is heading up Defeat Disinfo, and he said he received the funding from DARPA when his work was ""part of an effort to combat extremism overseas.""

After this article was published, the Post updated its reporting to clarify that Hougland was ""using open-source technology initially incubated with funding from DARPA."" The Post originally reported: ""The initiative is run by Curtis Hougland, who received initial funding for the technology from DARPA, the Pentagon’s research arm, as part of an effort to combat extremism overseas.""

Hougland explained in an interview with the Post that he was unhappy that top social media accounts often supported Trump, and had effectively defended the president in recent days from claims that he had suggested Americans inject themselves with disinfectant.

WHAT DID TRUMP REALLY SAY ABOUT DISINFECTANT?

The effort raised the question of whether taxpayer funds were being repurposed for political means, and whether social media platforms have rules in place that could stymie Hougland's efforts -- if he plays along.

In a statement to Fox News that was posted on social media, DARPA flatly rejected the Post's reporting, and said Hougland was apparently misrepresenting the agency's work.

""Hougland's claim DARPA funded the tech at the heart of his political work is grossly misleading,"" DARPA tweeted. ""He advised briefly on ways to counter ISIS online. He was not consulted to design AI or analysis tools, nor certainly anything remotely political. DARPA is strictly apolitical.""

""Hougland had a tertiary consulting role advising an agency program on how to explore new and better ways to counter America's adversaries online,"" a spokesperson for DARPA separately told Fox News. ""He was not consulted for technical expertise designing artificial intelligence or network analysis tools, nor certainly any research that was remotely political. ... Unequivocally, DARPA funding did not help advance the technology with which Hougland now works any more than does his use of other agency technologies like the internet or mobile phone.""

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Facebook told Fox News that ""our policies require creators and publishers to tag business partners in their branded content posts when there's an exchange of value between a creator or publisher and a business partner.""

Politicians and PACs who are authorized under Facebook's policy entitled “Ads About Social Issues, Elections or Politics” are allowed to use the site's branded content tool, the spokesperson added. The policy suggested that if Hougland paid any influencers, the arrangement would need to be disclosed.

As part of the authorization process for advertisers, Facebook says on its website that it ""confirms their ID and allows them to disclose who is responsible for the ad, which will appear on the ad itself. The ad and 'Paid for by' disclaimer are placed in the Ad Library for seven years, along with more information such as range of spend and impressions, as well as demographics of who saw it.""

After this article was published, a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News that the site doesn't have any comment ""on the tactics of a political consultant or similar organization."" But, the spokesperson did point to Twitter's platform manipulation and spam policy, adding that ""if we find anyone to be in violation of these rules, we’ll take a range of enforcement actions."" Further, the spokesperson said Twitter also has a ""thorough policy on automation and the use of third-party applications on our service.""

In 2018, Twitter launched its Political Campaigning Policy, which promises a degree of ""transparency"" for paid political communications.

CORONAVIRUS TIMELINE SHOWS DEMS, MEDIA, GOP HAVE CHANGED TUNE ON THE PANDEMIC

The policy requires ""advertisers who want to run political campaigning ads for Federal elections to self-identify and certify that they are located in the US Candidates and committees will have to provide their FEC ID, and non-FEC registered organizations and individuals will have to submit a notarized form.""

Additionally, ""handles used for political campaigning advertising will have to comply with stricter requirements,"" Twitter's policy states. ""The handle’s profile photo, header photo, and website must be consistent with its online presence and the Twitter bio must include a website that provides valid contact information. We will also be including a visual badge and disclaimer information on promoted content from certified accounts in the near future. This will allow users to easily identify political campaigning ads, know who paid for them, and whether it was authorized by a candidate.""

Twitter provided an image of what promoted political content ideally would look like.

McChrystal, who led U.S. forces in Afghanistan before he was fired by then-President Obama in 2010 for deriding his civilian bosses in a Rolling Stone interview, told the Post that the operation was necessary, even if it might appear unseemly.

“Everyone wishes the Pandora’s box was closed and none of this existed, but it does,"" McChrystal said.

McChrystal has not explicitly endorsed Biden, even though the new information warfare project is intended to help his candidacy. The former general has previously gone on the record with a less-than-glowing assessment of Biden's competence.

BIN LADEN WANTED 'TOTALLY UNPREPARED' JOE BIDEN TO BE PRESIDENT, SET OFF CRISIS IN AMERICA, DECLASSIFIED DOCS SHOW

One of the tidbits in the Rolling Stone interview by Michael Hastings recounted how McChrystal had lost confidence in Biden after he had suggested a counterterrorism strategy.

""'Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal said, imagining a way to dismissively mock Biden if someone were to ask about him during an upcoming question-and-answer session. 'Who's that?'""

""'Biden?"" another adviser chimed in, according to Hastings. 'Did you say: Bite Me?'""

The local Chinese government defended the public shaming and claimed it was an ""on-site disciplinary warning activity"" and no ""inappropriateness"" occurred, the BBC reported .

The public shaming in China's southern region comes a week after the country announced a massive lockdown in the north as the country prepares to host the Olympics.

China ordered the lockdown of as many as 13 million people in neighborhoods and workplaces in the northern city of Xi’an following a spike in coronavirus cases, setting off panic buying just weeks before the country hosts the Winter Olympic Games.

State media reported that city officials ordered all residents to stay home unless they had a pressing reason to go out and suspended all transport to and from the city apart from special cases.

One person from each household will be permitted out every two days to buy household necessities, the order said. It took effect at midnight Wednesday, with no word on when it might be lifted.

There was no word on whether the virus was the newly surging omicron variant or the far more common delta. China says it has recorded just seven omicron cases — four in the southern manufacturing center of Guangzhou, two in the southern city of Changsha, and one in the northern port of Tianjin.

Of course, there is no easy answer to the question. Between variants and vaccines losing their effectiveness over time, the question seems almost impossible to answer. There also seems to be variations on what ""normal"" means anymore. The White House did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.

Cruz, for his part, tweeted a December 2020 article from Axios that quoted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top disease expert, putting the number at between 75% and 80%.

12,Abigail Shrier: Audio exposes California teachers’ efforts to subvert parents and recruit kids to LGBTQ+ clubs,Teny Sahakian,"

California educators are engaged in a calculated and strategic effort to subvert parents and recruit middle school students into LGBTQ+ clubs, Abigail Shrier warns.

""We are seeing coaching and deliberate confusion of our young kids when it comes to gender identity,"" Abigail Shrier, author of ""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,"" told Fox News.

""Parents can never underestimate the level of deception and manipulation that activist teachers are willing to go to on issues of gender,"" she said after listening to leaked audio from a conference with California’s largest teachers union.

Shrier was sent audio files from a California Teachers Association (CTA) conference called ""2021 LGBTQ+ Issues Conference, Beyond the Binary: Identity & Imagining Possibilities.""

The sold-out conference in Palm Springs at the end of October provided best practices workshops that encouraged teachers to ""have the courage to create a safe environment that fosters bravery to explore sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.""

Listening to the audio from the event, Shrier found that teachers ""among other things, were given instruction on the surveying of students and the deceptions of parents for encouraging their inclusion in LGBTQ+ clubs,"" she told Fox News.

LIFELONG DEMOCRAT, FEMINIST WARNS PARTY TO STOP TRYING TO ABOLISH BIOLOGICAL SEX OR LOSE VOTES

""These were sixth-graders we’re talking about surveilling,"" said Shrier. ""We’re talking about targeting kids as young as about 11 years old for personal invitations to the LGBTQ club based on these children's internet searches.""

Shrier said the most alarming thing she heard was teachers who admitted to reading children’s Google search histories for signs of interest in LGBTQ issues as a way to target kids for recruitment and actively encouraging other teachers to do the same.

""The fact that they were targeting children for these personal invitations to their club is very concerning, and that they were coaching other teachers in the surveillance of students for this purpose is really not something we usually see,"" said Shrier.

Attendees of the conference spoke in depth about ways to subvert parents, suggesting changing the name of the club from ""Gay Straight Alliance,"" to another name like ""Equity Club.""

One teacher reportedly encouraged teachers not to keep a roster for the clubs, so if a parent ever asks if her child is a member the teacher can plead ignorance.

At the CTA conference, two teachers led a seminar about ""How we run a ‘GSA’ (Gay-Straight Alliance club) in Conservative Communities,"" and discussed their strategies for how to ""get the bodies in the door"" and ensure kids keep coming back when ""we saw our membership numbers start to decline.""

""Much of the discussion was recruitment: ‘How do we get students to stay and discuss these things the way we want them to?’"" Shrier recalled.

She said the teachers spoke openly about their motivations for creating this coalition of gender-obsessed students.

""They said, effectively, if you want to bring a new society into existence, it seems the way to start that is with children,"" said Shrier. ""And so activist teachers are looking to recruit other people’s children in their revolution.""

""You have to ask yourself if teachers are willing to make these remarks in a broad address — a sold-out conference — what are they doing that we don't know about?""

Shrier said Americans have widely been naïve, with well-intentioned parents supporting clubs that promote safe spaces.

""Unfortunately, these spaces have been exploited by activists, teachers who have done so much as direct students not to repeat anything that is said in that club,"" she said.

""Parents really need to tell their middle school students or high school students, ‘No teacher should ever tell you to keep a secret from your parents.’""

Following Shrier's reporting on the conference Thursday, the Spreckels Union School District, the district where two of the conference participants work, sent out an email with a list of new guidelines around student clubs.

""The District has taken immediate steps to address several of the concerns raised in the article,"" the email states. It goes on to say clubs must submit an outline of all activities and materials before meeting, student sign-in sheets will be maintained and parent/guardian permission will be required for club participation.

The list of new practices concluded with, ""Teachers are prohibited from monitoring students’ online activity for any non-academic purposes.""

13,High-profile Houston Democrats face corruption allegations,Houston Keene,"

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo are each battling similar but separate controversies involving millions of dollars in government contracts awarded to politically connected individuals.

The high-stakes drama engulfing the political scene in the nation's fourth-largest city has so far escaped national media coverage.

HOUSTON’S DEMOCRAT MAYOR FACING POSSIBLE REFERENDUM ON HIS POWERS AFTER 35,000 SIGNATURES COLLECTED: REPORT

Hidalgo has faced intense scrutiny over an $11 million vaccine outreach contract to Elevate Strategies, which is run by Felicity Pereyra, a Democratic political insider with ties to the county commissioners court. Pereyra also worked on Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Pereyra's company was a one-woman operation until recently and only had existed for two years before being awarded the contract.

Pereyra’s company was awarded the contract over UT Health, one of the city’s major hospitals, and the ""deciders"" for the contract all answered directly to Hidalgo without input from the commissioners' panel.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg's office subpoenaed Hidalgo regarding the contract. When asked about the subpoena, an attorney for Hidalgo told local press, ""We have always followed the law, and we continue to follow the law.""

""It is grassroots outreach. It's the same kind of outreach you do with political outreach. We are at a point where it is a campaign for people to get vaccinated,"" Hidalgo said in August in defense of the choice.

A mix of industry experts and county officials told the local Fox News affiliate, FOX 26, that Elevate Strategies did not even meet the basic requirements to engage in an endeavor of this scope. Additionally, the experts and officials said that there was no way that Elevate Strategies could have met the strict financial requirements for bidding on county contracts.

Harris County requires annual billing records dating back five years as well as an audited income statement and a qualifying balance sheet.

But Elevate Strategies reportedly wasn’t required to provide financial statements during the bidding process.

A spokesperson for Hidalgo previously told FOX 26 that Pereyra’s firm has worked with the county on projects before, including the most recent census.

Hidalgo canceled the deal amid scrutiny but thousands of dollars were still paid to Elevate Strategies by the county as the arrangement imploded.

Turner made local headlines when he was accused of corruption by former Houston Housing and Community Development Director Tom McCasland regarding a $15 million housing contract the mayor allegedly moved to award to a ""co-developer"" firm – the Harbor Venture Group – where his former law partner, Barry Barnes, is in charge.

Turner, who has near unilateral authority to award city contracts as Houston mayor, has denied the allegations , saying he didn’t know Barnes was involved with the company awarded the contract and claiming there was ""no conflict"" with the contract.

The Houston mayor allegedly went against staff recommendations when awarding the multi-million-dollar contract for senior housing, approving it instead of four other contracts costing $16.2 million that would build over 350 affordable family units.

McCasland was fired the same day as the allegations surfaced in September and soon after Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg’s office reportedly began investigating the deal.

Three weeks after McCasland's allegations against Turner, the mayor canceled the project while claiming the deal had become ""too much of a distraction.""

Carmen Roe, a defense lawyer and adjunct professor at the University of Houston School of Law, told Fox News in a phone interview that subpoenas for Turner ""are likely to be forthcoming,"" although none are currently in play.

Roe also said that ""no one can possibly guess as to what a grand jury is going to do"" when it came to charges against Hidalgo and that ""there's a lot of information that we don't know.""

""What we do know is: very suspicious, highly irregular and could lead to criminal charges,"" Roe said.

""Both cases, at a value of greater than $300,000, are first-degree felonies,"" she added, referring to Hidalgo and Turner. ""Which means they carry a possible punishment range of a minimum of five years in prison up to life in prison.""

Roe added that she believes it is ""going to be difficult to even conceive of the notion that two of our most significant political leaders here in the City of Houston could be charged with such serious charges here in Houston.""

Houston City Councilman Michael Kubosh told Fox News in a phone interview that ""nothing pollutes like power, and nothing pollutes absolutely like absolute power.""

""They have really stretched out their power to do everything they can to maximize their agenda,"" Kubosh said. ""I think it's a twisted agenda.""

Kubosh also blasted the Harris County court of commissioners for ""not doing a thing"" regarding Hidalgo.

Both Hidalgo and Turner have emphatically denied any wrongdoing and neither has been criminally charged to date.

Mary Benton, Turner's communications director, told Fox News in an email that Turner's administration ""has done nothing wrong and the former housing director said as much in his comments.""

""The administration has the authority to select a housing development regardless of the staff’s recommendations as was thoroughly discussed in a public housing committee,"" Benton said.

""This development would have provided seniors with affordable housing in an area where none had been built with Harvey multi-family funds and was supported by the District E council member,"" she added. ""The General Land Office has approved every city housing development since taking over the DR-17 funding.

""It’s also important to remember that the General Land Office (GLO) was aware of every step taken by the City of Houston and had approved the process up until we decided to halt the project,"" Benton concluded. ""No action approving the distribution of funds had taken place because the item had not yet made it to council where it would have been fully vetted.""

Hidalgo spokesperson Ashlee McFarlane told Fox News in an email that ""there was no benefit to Judge Hidalgo from this contract, financially or otherwise, and it was approved with bipartisan support through the normal procurement process.""

""This commissioners court has made it a priority to give opportunities to local, small and minority-owned businesses who have the qualifications to serve their community,"" said Rafael Lemaitre, Hidalgo’s spokesman.

""This firm was selected because they have demonstrated that they can reach people strategically and encourage them to get vaccinated,"" Lemaitre also said.",https://www.foxnews.com

15,"Trump comments on Ghislaine Maxwell arrest, says 'I wish her well'",Morgan Phillips,"

President Trump on Tuesday commented on the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, the incarcerated former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, and said he wishes her ""well.""

During a coronavirus briefing at the White House, a reporter noted that Trump has criticized Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew for their rumored involvement in the Epstein sex scandal, and asked the president if he thinks Maxwell will turn in “very powerful men.”

""I just wish her well, frankly,” the president said at his first coronavirus briefing since April. “I've met her numerous times over the years... I just wish her well, whatever it is.""

The president added that he hadn’t “really been following it too much” and he didn’t know anything about the situation with Prince Andrew.

In August of last year, around the time that Epstein committed suicide in prison, the president added fuel to conspiracy theories that implied the Clintons were somehow involved in Epstein’s death.

""Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen,"" a tweet by Terrence K. WIlliams read, alongside a photo of Epstein and one of the Clintons. ""#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he’s dead I see #TrumpBodyCount trending but we know who did this! RT if you’re not Surprised.""

The president retweeted the post at the time.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL INDICTMENT: HOW JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S ALLEGED MADAME GROOMED VICTIMS

Newly resurfaced footage shows the president describing Epstein’s private Caribbean island as a “cesspool.”

“Just ask Prince Andrew,” Trump told reporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2015. “He’ll tell you about it. The island was an absolute cesspool.”

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is now seeking an interview with Prince Andrew as part of its criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates.

Maxwell, the socialite daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell, was arrested in early July and charged with conspiracy and perjury in a multi-state sex trafficking ring involving three unnamed minors between 1994 and 1997.

Prosecutors alleged that Maxwell, between that time, ""assisted, facilitated and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom and ultimately abuse victims known to Maxwell and Epstein to be under the age of 18.""

New York Judge Alison Nathan said Maxwell, accused of sexually abusing and exploiting girls as young as 14 alongside Epstein, posed too great a flight risk to be allowed to leave. Maxwell will be behind bars in a Brooklyn, N.Y., detention center until her trial, tentatively scheduled for July 2021. She was arrested on July 2 at her New Hampshire estate.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL SECRETLY MARRIED BUT WON'T REVEAL HUSBAND'S NAME, PROSECUTORS SAY

Another woman has claimed that Maxwell herself raped her dozens of times -- beginning when she was just 14 years old -- and says she is willing to take the stand and testify against Epstein’s ex-girlfriend.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Jane Doe, who wishes to protect her identity, said Maxwell sexually abused her beginning in 1991 in Florida. She said the abuse continued until she was 16.

“She did rape me. I would say it’s more than 20 or 30 times,” she said. “She is just as evil as Jeffrey Epstein ... She is a rapist.”

Maxwell's arrest and the details surrounding her case have given the world a glimpse into the life of the woman once considered Epstein's closest confidant and who has hobnobbed with princes and presidents around the world. Her proximity to Epstein and those he socialized with has made her the target of powerful people who now prefer not to have their names associated with Epstein or Maxwell.

Trump, who in the briefing Tueday admitted he’s met Maxwell “numerous times,” has been photographed with Maxwell, along with Epstein and now-first lady Melania Trump.

Thousands of homeless people have been housed in San Francisco’s empty hotels in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.

However, City Journal contributor Erica Sandberg told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Wednesday the policy has been an ""absolute disaster,""

""It's solving exactly nothing and as a matter of fact, it's making all the problems worse,"" said Sandberg, who described the scene inside the hotels as ""about as bad as you can imagine, only exponentially worse.""

""You are talking drug-fueled parties, overdoses, deaths, people are being assaulted. You have sexual assaults going on, it is pandemonium,"" she said. ""It is extremely bad and it needs to stop.""

City officials reportedly secured close to 5,000 rooms at several city hotels that signed up to house homeless and other members of at-risk populations who need to quarantine.

Controversy ensued after a report alleged that the city was providing alcohol, marijuana, and methadone to homeless addicts residing in the hotels.

""The people who are assigned as disaster workers, these people have been librarians,"" Sandberg told host Brian Kilmeade. ""They are just paper pushers, administrators who are reassigned to these hotels and what they are telling me is beyond the pale.

""They are not just horrified, they are traumatized by what they see. You have mattresses that have feces on them, blood, hospital bands on the floor. What people are seeing is so horrible that they walk out and they say, 'I don't want to go back in there.'""

A federal judge granted a temporary injunction Monday against a federal vaccine mandate for Navy SEALs, who sued President Biden because they were seeking a religious exemption.

Judge Reed O'Connor, the U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Texas, issued the stay in response to a lawsuit filed by First Liberty Institute in November on behalf of 35 active-duty SEALs and three reservists seeking a religious exemption, as first reported by Fox News Digital.

LAWSUIT FILED ON BEHALF OF NAVY SEALs FACING INTIMIDATION FOR SEEKING RELIGIOUS COVID-19 VACCINE EXEMPTIONS

""The Navy service members in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect. The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment,"" O'Connor wrote in his ruling. ""There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.""

The SEALs represented in the lawsuit were all members of various Christian denominations and objected to the vaccine mandate based on ""their sincerely held religious beliefs,"" claiming the military was violating their constitutional rights.

""We are aware of the injunction and are reviewing it,"" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.

In December, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and several of his fellow Republicans in Congress signed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.

Just days after now-18-year-old Daphne Westbrook was located in Samson, Ala., Tennessee's Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office said Friday morning that law enforcement agents are still searching for her father, John Westbrook.

Jamal Simmons is set to be named the new communications director for Harris, replacing Ashley Etienne, who left in December, Fox News has confirmed.

Simmons previously hosted a news show for The Hill called ""Why You Should Care,"" in which he aired a segment in August 2019 titled ""Dazed & Confused,"" poking fun at Biden for the many conflated and exaggerated stories he’s told the public over the years.

""We do this story about once a week!"" Simmons said at the time. ""It’s what you get with Uncle Joe.""

HARRIS NAMES NEW COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AFTER WAVE OF STAFF DEPARTURES

Simmons also cast doubt on COVID-19 vaccines while the Trump administration rushed to get one approved for emergency use in 2020.

""Trump’s fatally ill-managed Coronavirus response seems to have turned voters off to him the way Katrina destroyed Bush’s political reputation, but pushing a janky science vaccine into the public for political purposes would turn incompetent culpability into intentional harm,"" he tweeted in September 2020.

Simmons responded Friday, ""As a pundit for much of my career I have tweeted a lot and spoken out on public issues. Sometimes I have been sarcastic, unclear, or just plainly missed the mark. I sincerely apologize for offending those who care as much as I do about making America the best, multi-ethnic, diverse democracy it can be. I know the role I am taking on is to represent the Biden-Harris administration, and I will do so with humility, sincerity and respect.""

During the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Simmons warned that Biden shouldn’t get ""too comfortable"" with the Black vote.

""I think #JoeBiden’s heart is in the right place but I just heard the perfect summation of his position,"" he tweeted in May 2020. ""’Black ppl are happy to have Biden at the cookout but he should remember he didn’t get the original invitation on his own. He was a plus one.’ Don’t get too comfortable.""

Simmons also had a few things to say about then-Sen. Harris’ presidential campaign during the Democratic primary.

""Prior to the debate I had been having bad feelings about the Harris campaign,"" he wrote in July 2019. ""It seemed listless, unfocused. These lackluster fundraising totals are not a surprise. I'm curious to see how this changes over the summer, now that Kamala's poll numbers have increased and Biden seems more like a winged bird than the inevitable nominee.""

After Harris dropped out of the race in December 2019, Simmons said Harris had a hard time going off script in her arguments and criticism of her opponents, and that she ""never quite got comfortable getting out of the pre-planned moment.""

""When Kamala Harris goes into a room, frankly sometimes when Joe Biden goes into a room you just don't know what will happen in that room, what they will argue,"" Simmons added.

Simmons has also tweeted comments that would likely spark the ire of today's progressives.

In 2010, Simmons repeatedly advocated for the arrest of illegal immigrants.

WEARING A MASK CUTS OWN RISK OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS BY 65 PERCENT, EXPERTS SAY

“Also, wear your mask, even if you are home, to participate in a virtual meeting that involves being seen — such as on Zoom or another video-conferencing platform — by non-DNR staff,” Cole said, according to the Sentinel. “Set the safety example which shows you as a DNR public service employee care about the safety and health of others.”

Under the Gov. Tony Evers' order, Wisconsinites are required to cover up when they are indoors or in an enclosed space with anyone outside their household or living unit. Face coverings are also ""strongly recommended"" when people are outdoors and it's not possible to maintain physical distancing, according to a press release from the governor's office.

There are exceptions to the rule, however, such as when someone is eating, drinking, or swimming. Furthermore, individuals with health conditions or disabilities that prevent them from being able to safely wear a mask or face covering are exempt.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES CORONAVIRUS MASKS WILL BE REQUIRED IN HOUSE CHAMBER

""We need to get back to working together statewide to flatten the curve and to prevent the spread of this virus,"" Evers said in July. ""The most important thing you can do is serve as an example to those around you by wearing a mask or face covering, practicing physical distancing, and following best safety practices.""

26,"NYC mayor says he supports recently passed legislation allowing 800,000 noncitizens to vote",Andrew Miller,"

Newly sworn in New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Saturday that he supports legislation passed by the city council allowing non-citizens to vote in local elections.

""I believe that New Yorkers should have a say in their government, which is why I have and will continue to support this important legislation,"" Adams, a Democrat who took office at the start of 2022, said in a statement. ""While I initially had some concerns about one aspect of the bill, I had a productive dialogue with my colleagues in government that put those concerns at ease. I believe allowing the legislation to be enacted is by far the best choice, and look forward to bringing millions more into the democratic process.""

MANHATTAN DA: 'I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PUSHBACK' TO LIGHTER PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLENT CRIMINALS

On his first day in office last week, Adams was asked about the bill and said he was concerned the provision stating that a non-citizen voter only had to be in the city for 30 days to qualify to vote.

The bill, known as ""Our city, our vote"", was approved by the city council in December and would allow roughly 800,000 to take part in local elections.

NEW YORK MAYOR ERIC ADAMS NEEDS TO DO THESE 5 THINGS RIGHT NOW

The measure, which would affect green card holders and those with work authorizations, doesn’t include state or federal elections and people in the country illegally would not be allowed to vote.

Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed concerns about the bill before leaving office but did not veto it before leaving office.

New Yorkers who spoke to Fox News last month shared mixed feelings about the bill.

""I think it's a good idea,"" a New Yorker in favor of the change told Fox News. ""If they're living here, but they're on a working visa, I mean, I guess they should have a say as to what's going on in the city, right?""

Another lifelong New Yorker opposed the measure, saying, ""I do not agree with it. Why should they? They're not from here.""

The mayor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

Short-staffed hospitals across the country are turning to international nurses to fill staff shortages as thousands of healthcare workers across the country are being cut loose for not submitting to a coronavirus vaccine.

Administrators at Billings Clinic in Montana have contracts with two dozen international nurses and is one of ""scores"" of hospitals across the country bringing in nurses from other countries to address staffing issues including retirements, according to an NPR report .

The report states that a backlog of more than 5,000 international nurses are waiting from countries like Ghana, Thailand, and the Philippines to be cleared to obtain visa approval to work in U.S. hospitals.

""We are seeing an absolute boom in requests for international nurses,"" Lesley Hamilton-Powers, a board member of AAIHR and a vice president for Avant Healthcare Professionals in Florida, said.

UNVACCINATED RHODE ISLAND NURSES SLAM NEW HOSPITAL POLICY: ‘WE’VE ABANDONED COMMON SENSE’

The push for more international nurses comes as thousands of nurses and healthcare workers across the country are losing their hospital jobs over coronavirus vaccine requirements.

Minnesota’s Mayo Clinic recently fired 700 unvaccinated employees who did not submit to coronavirus vaccines. Over 500 healthcare workers have been fired in Massachusetts for disobeying vaccine mandates and over 30,000 healthcare workers in New York have been fired.

""We worked so hard last year,"" Jennifer Bridges, a Texas nurse fired in November over vaccine requirements told Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""I mean, we were there through thick and thin when we had no help… it was horrible. And these people that are putting forth these rules right now for us and kicking us to the curb, they weren't there. They weren't even in the building to be seen for months. They were staying at home while we were doing all the work.""

The Billings Clinic told Fox News in a statement that it is not one of the hospitals that has fired staff due to a vaccine mandate and has hired international nurses for years.

""While these two actions may be happening at the same time, bringing these nurses into our organization and the Billings Clinic community is entirely unrelated to any federal mandates, the statement said. ""The recruitment of international nurses is one tool of many in our efforts to round out staffing numbers with skilled nurses.

28,California hospitals went from mandating vaccines to forcing COVID-positive health care employees to work,Emma Colton,"

The California Department of Public Health issued new guidance allowing hospitals and health networks to force COVID-positive healthcare workers to continue working if they are asymptomatic.

""The department is providing temporary flexibility to help hospitals and emergency services providers respond to an unprecedented surge and staffing shortages. Hospitals have to exhaust all other options before resorting to this temporary tool. Facilities and providers using this tool, should have asymptomatic COVID-19 positive workers interact only with COVID-19 positive patients to the extent possible,"" the health department said in a statement .

The health department issued the guidance Saturday, and outlines that healthcare workers don’t have to isolate or test negative and can immediately return to work if they are asymptomatic.

WEEKS AFTER MINNESOTA NURSES WARN OF STAFFING CRISIS, MAYO CLINIC FIRES 700 UNVACCINATED WORKERS

The guidance is in effect until Feb. 1 and comes as the omicron variant of the virus spikes across the nation. Positive healthcare workers will need to wear N-95 respirator masks.

The announcement sparked outrage from the SEIU, as well as other health officials and workers in the state.

""Healthcare workers and patients need the protection of clear rules guided by strong science. Allowing employers to bring back workers who may still be infectious is one of the worst ideas I have heard during this pandemic, and that’s really saying something,"" Bob Schoonover, President of SEIU California and Executive Director of SEIU California, said according to CBS Sacramento .

TERMINATION OF UNVACCINATED HEALTH CARE WORKERS BACKFIRES AS BIDEN PLEDGES HELP AMID COVID SURGE

Staffing issues have plagued hospitals across the country as the omicron variant of the virus spikes, including in California where vaccine mandates were put into effect last year requiring health workers to get vaccinated or face termination. Health giant Kaiser Permanente suspended more than 2,000 unvaccinated employees in October and said those who still have not been vaccinated face termination this month.

The president of the California Nurses Association, Sandy Reding, said the health department's move will put patients at risk.

""We are very concerned,"" she said, according to NBC Bay Area. ""If you have health care workers who are COVID positive care for vulnerable populations, we can spread the COVID virus inside the hospital as well.""

""If we are going to set up for the surge, let’s set up protocols to have transmission reduced. Which means not have COVID positive people come to work,"" Reding added.

But to Dr. George Rutherford, professor of Epidemiology at University of California San Francisco, the move is not unprecedented.

RHODE ISLAND WENT FROM FIRING UNVACCINATED HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO ALLOWING THE COVID-POSITIVE TO WORK

""This is about having infected people taking care of infected people. We did this with Ebola in South Africa. We’ve done it before. It’s not the first play option in our playbook. I think staffing issues are such that it led the state to put this guidance out,"" he said, according to NBC Bay Area.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on the guidance.

Staffing issues have been reported in various parts of the state, including in San Diego. The CEO of Scripps Health in San Diego said last week that six to eight health care workers are calling the hospital per hour to report they have COVID.

""In the emergency departments, we do have patients that are literally stacked up 20 to 30 in some of the hospitals, waiting for an open bed that will hopefully be available when we discharge patients,"" Chris Van Gorder, president and CEO of Scripps Health, told NBC 7 San Diego

29,"Omicron, delta have fused into new 'deltacron' strain, Cyprus professor finds",Lawrence Richard,"

A new strain of the coronavirus appears to be a genetic fusion of currently known omicron and delta variants, a researcher claims.

The so-called ""deltacron"" strain pairs omicron genetic signatures with delta variant genomes, says Leondios Kostrikis, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus, according to CNBC.

While 25 cases of the uniquely recognizable strain have been found, Kostrikis predicted it will not last against the globally dominant omicron variant.

OMICRON CASES SURGE: MORE THAN 4,000 CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED NATIONWIDE, REPORT SAYS

""We will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious or if it will prevail,"" he told Cyprus' Sigma TV on Friday, according to the report.

The delta variant, which once usurped the alpha coronavirus strain as the most prevalent, now accounts for just under 5% of new cases in the United States.

Omicron, however, is responsible for the other 95.4% of new cases, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

It took only about a month for delta to be dethroned by the omicron variant, which continues to surge across the U.S.

New York and Florida have both recorded their highest-ever single-day totals for new COVID-19 cases in recent days and the U.S. reported 1,082,549 new cases on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

A health system operating in Arizona announced a ""critical staff crisis"" and updated its guidance to allow COVID-postive health employees to continue working.

"" COVID positive staff who are improving, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic do not require isolation but are required to wear N95 masks for up to 10 days of positive symptoms or testing. These measures are supported by the CDC,"" Dignity Health - a California-based health system that also operates in Arizona - wrote an email to St. Joseph Hospital staff in Phoenix, ABC15 reported .

The hospital system explained in a statement that it authorized the ""third tier"" of the CDC guidelines, which allow asymptomatic or recovering health workers with mild symptoms to continue working without a quarantine period.

CALIFORNIA WENT FROM MANDATING VACCINES TO FORCING COVID-POSITIVE HEALTH CARE EMPLOYEES TO WORK

""Due to the spread and impact of the COVID-19 omicron variant in Maricopa County, and in anticipation of a continued increase, Dignity Health facilities in Maricopa County have enacted the third tier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for COVID-19 positive health care workers. These guidelines allow COVID-19 positive health care personnel who are asymptomatic or improving with mild symptoms to work without a quarantine period,"" the statement said, according to ABC15.

Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed an executive order last year banning local or state governments from implementing vaccine mandates but exempted health care institutions.

Hospitals issued their own vaccine mandates, including the Mayo Clinic, which fired 700 employees last week for not complying, including employees at its Phoenix location . Dignity Health announced a vaccine mandate in August, and extended its vaccine deadline until February for at least one of its hospital centers .

TERMINATION OF UNVACCINATED HEALTH CARE WORKERS BACKFIRES AS BIDEN PLEDGES HELP AMID COVID SURGE

The updated guidance from Dignity sparked backlash from employees, who say it goes against what they were taught and learned since 2020.

""These patients are the poorest, the sickest, and the most at risk. To have a healthcare worker who’s going to be dealing directly with these people, coming back coughing, which is exactly what’s been happening…really leaves you no faith in the company that you work for,"" an anonymous health care worker for St. Joseph’s told ABC15.

The omicron variant of the virus has spiked across the country. Many hospitals have reported they are struggling with staffing amid an uptick in patients, which follows thousands of healthcare workers across the country being terminated last year for not complying with state and hospital vaccine mandates.

""I think they're going to really have a staffing crisis coming soon because either a lot of their employees will die, from what they’ve been telling us. Or, we’re just going to be fed up,"" the anonymous St. Joseph’s health care worker said.

RHODE ISLAND WENT FROM FIRING UNVACCINATED HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO ALLOWING THE COVID-POSITIVE TO WORK

Testing facilities in Arizona are also coping with a surge in patients attempting to get tested amid the spike. Some sites temporarily ran out of rapid test kits, according to ABC15.

""It’s actually substantially worse than I ever could have imagined. Yesterday alone, our patients across Arizona scheduled over 42,000 COVID-19 tests. Our previous record for scheduling was 32,000,"" said Embry Health CEO Raymond Embry on Saturday.

32,Biden administration guidance prioritizes race in administering COVID drugs,Kyle Morris,"

Guidance issued by the Biden administration states certain individuals may be considered ""high risk"" and more quickly qualify for monoclonal antibodies and oral antivirals used to treat COVID-19 based on their ""race or ethnicity.""

In a fact sheet issued for healthcare providers by the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency approved emergency use authorizations of sotrovimab – a monoclonal antibody proven to be effective against the Omicron variant – only to patients considered ""high risk.""

The guidance, updated in December 2021, says ""medical conditions or factors"" such as ""race or ethnicity"" have the potential to ""place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19,"" adding that the ""authorization of sotrovimab under the EUA is not limited to"" other factors outlined by the agency.

NEW YORK SAYS IT WILL PRIORITIZE NON-WHITE PEOPLE IN DISTRIBUTING LOW SUPPLY OF COVID-19 TREATMENTS

Older age, obesity, pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are among the multiple medical conditions and factors associated with what are considered ""high risk"" individuals by the FDA.

Some states, including New York and Utah, have made it clear they will prioritize certain racial minorities over other high-risk patients when it comes to the distribution of particular COVID treatments.

Last week, New York’s Department of Health released a document detailing its plan to distribute treatments such as monoclonal antibody treatment and antiviral pills.

The plan includes a section on eligibility for the scarce antiviral pills that people must meet to receive the treatment, including a line stating a person needs to have ""a medical condition or other factors that increase their risk for severe illness.""

CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SUFFERED ACADEMICALLY DURING COVID-19, NEW REPORT REVEALS

One such ""risk factor"" is being a race or ethnicity that is not White due to ""longstanding systemic health and social inequities.""

""Non-white race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity should be considered a risk factor, as longstanding systemic health and social inequities have contributed to an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19,"" the memo reads.

In guidelines issued by the state of Utah for the distribution of monoclonal antibodies in the state, residents who are ""non-white race or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity"" receive 2 additional points when calculating their ""COVID-19 risk score.""

""Race/ethnicity continues to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease, and the Utah COVID Risk Score is one approach to address equitable access to hard hit communities,"" the Utah guidance stated, adding a reminder that national guidance from the FDA ""specifically states that race and ethnicity may be considered when identifying patients most likely to benefit from this lifesaving treatment.""

Similarly, the framework issued by the state of Minnesota advises clinicians and health systems to ""consider heightened risk of progression to severe COVID-19 associated with race and ethnicity when determining eligibility"" for the allocation for monoclonal antibody therapies.

""FDA’s acknowledgment means that race and ethnicity alone, apart from other underlying health conditions, may be considered in determining eligibility for mAbs,"" the framework states. ""It is ethically appropriate to consider race and ethnicity in mAb eligibility decisions when data show elevated risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes for Black, Indigenous and other people of color (BIPOC populations), and that this risk cannot be adequately addressed by determining eligibility based on underlying health conditions (perhaps due to underdiagnosis of health conditions that elevate risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes in these populations).""

33,Deltacron: a new variant of COVID-19 or a lab contamination mishap?,Amy Mcgorry,"

Deltacron, the reported new variant of COVID-19 said to combine both delta and omicron variants, has sparked a reaction of skepticism from world health experts.

Scientists have expressed their doubts about its existence to various media platforms, saying that deltacron is likely the result of a lab contamination error. However, on Monday, the scientist behind the discovery defended his findings. A Cyprus researcher discovered deltacron, according to a report in Bloomberg News Saturday.

According to the report, Leondios Kostrikis, who is a biological sciences professor at the University of Cyprus, discovered a genetic background of the delta variant along with some mutations of omicron. The media report stated that Kostrikis and his team claim to have found 25 cases and sent the findings to GISAID, an international database that tracks changes in the virus.

Kostrikis told the Cyprus Sigma TV network last week, ""We will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious,"" but he told the media outlet that the dominant strain will be omicron, according to multiple reports.

Dr. Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Imperial College in London, tweeted that the anomaly appears to be ""quite clearly contamination"" and said that it does not meet the criteria for a new variant.

OMICRON, DELTA HAVE FUSED INTO NEW 'DELTACRON' STRAIN

Another World Health Organization COVID-19 expert, Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, also wrote on her Twitter account, ""This is likely sequencing artifact (lab contamination of Omicron fragments in a Delta specimen)"".

Amidst the backlash, Kostrikis defended his findings with an emailed statement Sunday to the Bloomberg media outlet.

Kostrikis told the media outlet that the contamination hypothesis should be ruled out because the deltacron infection rate was higher among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 than among non-hospitalized patients, according to the report.

The researcher in Cyprus said that the cases he identified ""indicate an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event,"" according to the report.

OMICRON CASES SURGE: MORE THAN 4,000 CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED NATIONWIDE, REPORT SAYS

Kostrikis also said in the media report that the samples were processed in multiple sequencing procedures in more than one country. According to his statement in the report, at least one other sequence from Israel was deposited in a global database that exhibited deltacron genetic characteristics.

""These findings refute the undocumented statements that deltacron is a result of a technical error,"" Kostrikis said in the media report.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., emergency department physician Dr. Fred Davis told Fox News, ""The reports out of Cyprus are the first we are hearing of such a variant and will continue to be followed.""

36,Barack Obama's Civilian Army,Glenn Beck,"

Thursday's show, I believe, it's the most controversial of all the shows this week — and maybe ever.

I will give you some facts, some history but also some of the future.

The reason Thursday's show is the last before Friday's solution, I wanted you to see who was advising the president and what they are doing, before I could ask you to look at this phrase from Barack Obama and think he meant it literally:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

THEN-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BARACK OBAMA: We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

I don't know how anyone will respond to the facts I am going to present, because they really haven't responded to any of our questions or challenged any of the facts in our last few shows other than ""Hey, don't call him a 'czar!'""

But I can't make this piece of the puzzle fit, unless this piece is about building some kind of thug-ocracy.

All week we've been asking tough questions — here's one more, Mr. President: Why do we need a civilian national security force that is ""just as strong, just as powerful"" as the military?

Here's why I ask this question: Who are we fighting? Who internally is threatening our security?

It's clearly not because we feel there is a threat from illegal aliens crossing the border, because anyone who would say that has been deemed a racist. A civilian national security force on the border is called The Minuteman and the attitude from this administration — as well as the Bush administration — is that they were ""vigilantes."" So it's not for the border.

It can't be a civilian national security force against Islamic extremists, because according to this administration we aren't even at war against Islamic extremists anymore. Is this administration really going to ask the American people to profile and call-in tips on Muslim Americans who act suspiciously?

So, who's left? Is it possible we are seeing the beginnings of another enemy?

Mr. President, is your civilian national security force to protect us from things the Missouri State Police, your own Homeland Security and the liberal Southern Law Poverty Center have come out and said were a threat: militia groups; tea party goers; folks with ""Don't Tread on Me"" flags; me; Sarah Palin?

Think about this: Is it unreasonable to think this government would ask you to spy on your neighbors, in light of these recent stories:

— Flag.gov e-mail asking for tips on ""fishy"" behavior

— Cookies on your computer that track whenever you've been on a government Web site — this used to be illegal but that was changed

— The government is using outside companies to track and contact you. Are they gathering information on you? I know that on ""cash for clunkers"" they didn't trust the dealers.

• Is Beck right? Click here to sound off

To me, all of this sounds like a sci-fi movie, but again I have to ask the reasonable question, in these unreasonable times: Who will the civilian national security force protect us from?

Maybe a better question to ask is, Mr. President: Do you know of a coming event?

Or maybe we should ask Joe Biden, who said:

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

THEN-VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN: Mark my words, it will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy. The world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old senator president of the United States of America.... Remember I said it standing here, if you don't remember anything else I said: Watch, we're gonna have an international crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

Is this civilian national security force just preparing for what Joe Biden predicted?

Who builds an army against an unidentified, unrecognized threat? Because we can't answer that question — or any of the others just proposed — then it's up to us to look for clues.

Maybe we have to start with the company whose CEO is a close financial adviser to the president of the United States, who helped write the health care bill and cap-and-trade bill and who has billions of dollars at stake: Jeffrey Immelt.

Immelt has been appointed by president to the board of directors to the New York Federal Reserve. Does he have any information? Let's look for what they may be saying the threat will be that we will need a civilian national security force against.

It would seem to me the network that sells ""Yes We Did"" dolls, mugs and t-shirts and is obviously extraordinarily close to the president in seven different ways — is it possible to watch their network and their news, to see if they have any inside information as to what this threat may be? Immelt's network seems to be the leading network in predicting a lot of trouble, but they're not alone:

ED SCHULTZ RADIO SHOW: Folks, these people are psycho. That's what they are. Sometimes I think they want Obama to get shot. I do. I really think that there are conservative broadcasters in this country who would love to see Obama taken out.

FRANK RICH, NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST: I'm just old enough, I was a kid, I remember I woke up in 1963 to the horrible events in Dallas. Even as a kid, I happened to be growing up in Washington, D.C., it was palatable to me all this hate talk about Kennedy and this sort of crazy fear.... But there were a lot of threats. There was a lot of stuff going on that in tone resembles this.

SEN. BARBARA BOXER, D-CALIF.: All of this is a diversion by the people who want to, frankly, hurt President Obama. And by the way I saw some of the clips of people storming these townhall meetings. The last time I saw well-dressed people doing this, was when Al Gore asked me to go down to Florida when they were recounting the ballots, and I was confronted with the same type of people. They were there screaming and yelling, ""Go back to California! Get out of here!"" and all the rest of it.

CONTESSA BREWER, MSNBC: ""A man at a pro-health care reform rally just outside, wore a semiautomatic assault rifle on his shoulder and a pistol on his hip.... The Associated Press reports about a dozen people in all at that event were visible carrying firearms.... There are questions about whether this has racial overtones. I mean, here you have a man of color in the presidency and white people showing up with guns strapped to their waists.

(END VIDEO MONTAGE)

Is it reasonable to ask the question — based on these clips — do they think that a good portion of the American people are the enemy? They are such a danger we need a civilian national security force as well-funded and well-trained as the military?

That's who they think the enemy is and, once again, the media has it completely wrong.

So who is the real enemy?

""Common Sense"" has been No. 1 for the last 10 weeks. One of the last chapters is ""The Enemy Within"" — I wrote it months ago. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out — let me give you this quote:

""It's not just the political class who has mastered the art of deception. There are other potentially deadly masters who will seek to exploit your frustration and sense of desperation. Many will warn you of government tyranny; they'll talk of secret societies, vast conspiracies, shadow governments, and the need for violent action. I urge you to stay away from these individuals and those ideas.""

We've showed you the radicals in this administration. Now I'll show you the radicals outside the administration who are being used and will be used by the media and by this administration:

There was the Obama Joker poster creator; the right tried to take advantage of this and added the word ""socialist"" under it. But the creator of the poster is a Kucinich supporter who doesn't like Obama because he's not left enough.

Then there was that clip on MSNBC: The racist white person (according to MSNBC) who brought a rifle to the Obama town hall — wasn't even white! He was black.

In Denver, Maurice Joseph Schwenkler and an at-large accomplish smashed in windows at the Democratic Party HQ in Denver. Both parties accused Schwenkler of supporting the other, but he's a ""trans-gendered anarchist"" who belongs to the radical anarchist protest group Denver Bash Back.

While the radicals in the White House may not be connected to the radicals just mentioned, they are connected by the fact that they are radicals.

Remember, Obama adviser ""czar"" Jones created STORM who believes: ""Revolutionaries need to be militant in street actions. As leaders in the fight for liberation, we should be role models of fearlessness before the state and the oppressor.""

These are the sort of tactics some of Obama's ""czars"" know best.

So when we've got a president creating a ""civilian force"" as strong as the military and an admitted far-left radical in the White House doing this:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VAN JONES, GREEN JOBS 'CZAR': Actually, my job is not so dissimilar than my job was before.... What I do, can I make it simple, I'm basically a community organizer with the federal family.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

How else am I supposed to read this? I'm happy to hear any other explanation than ""don't call him a czar.""

37,"Reps. Comer, Jordan expose new Fauci emails they say point to COVID-19 lab leak 'cover up'",Ronn Blitzer,"

Republican leaders on the House Oversight and Judiciary committees released excerpts of emails Tuesday that they say reveal National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Dr. Anthony Fauci knew that COVID-19 may have been intentionally modified and leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Reps. James Comer, R-Ky., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointed to a Feb. 1, 2020, conference call that included Fauci and former National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins in which the virus's origins were discussed.

TUNE IN: 'SPECIAL REPORT' DIVES INTO NEWLY REVEALED EMAILS OVER COVID-19 ORIGIN, TUESDAY AT 6PM ET ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL

""It was on this conference call that Drs. Fauci and Collins were first warned that COVID-19 may have leaked from the WIV and, further, may have been intentionally genetically manipulated,"" the Republicans' letter said.

The congressmen said that ""it is unclear if either Dr. Fauci or Dr. Collins ever passed these warnings along to other government officials or if they simply ignored them.""

The letter said other scientists participated in the call, four of whom wrote a paper titled, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2"" that they sent to Fauci and Collins three days after the call. The article did not argue that the virus originated in the lab.

The Republicans are now questioning whether the lab leak theory was dropped due to influence from Fauci and/or Collins.

FAUCI: REPORTS OF MILDER COVID VARIANT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN AS SIGNAL US CAN LESSEN RESTRICTIONS

""It is unclear what, if any, new evidence was presented or if the underlying science changed in that short period of time, but after speaking with Drs. Fauci and Collins, the authors abandoned their belief COVID-19 was the result of a laboratory leak,"" Comer and Jordan said, adding that they do not know whether Fauci or Collins edited the paper before it was published in Nature Medicine.

According to Comer and Jordan, the emails contain notes from the Feb. 1, 2020, conference call. One, from Dr. Jeremy Farrar to Collins, Fauci and current NIH Acting Director Lawrence Tabak, stated that ""a likely explanation"" could involve ""accidently creating a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission between humans[.]""

WHITE HOUSE INSISTS CDC LED BY SCIENCE AMID SHIFTING COVID-19 GUIDANCE

Discussing the similarities to a bat coronavirus and the very specific differences, Farrar said he ""just can’t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature.""

In response, however, Collins wrote that he was ""coming around to the view that a natural origin is more likely.""

By April, Collins, Fauci, Tabak and others were emailing about a ""very destructive conspiracy,"" linking to an article about the lab leak theory.

""I hoped the Nature Medicine article on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 would settle this. But probably didn't get much visibility,"" Collins said.

""I would not do anything about this right now. It is a shiny object that will go away in time,"" Fauci wrote back.

The same day Fauci wrote that email, Comer and Jordan's letter said, Fauci mentioned the Nature Medicine article while speaking at the White House, ""likely in an effort to further stifle the hypothesis COVID-19 leaked from the WIV.""

Comer and Jordan are now asking HHS for information regarding whether Fauci and Collins warned anyone at the White House about the lab leak theory, whether there was new evidence between Feb. 1 and Feb. 4, 2020, that convinced them it was not a leak, and whether they edited the content of the Nature Medicine article.

The congressmen are also calling for Fauci to appear for a transcribed interview where they can discuss this matter.

38,Supreme Court will likely issue 'split' ruling on Biden vaccine mandate: Dhillon,Yael Halon,"

Center for American Liberty CEO and civil rights attorney Harmeet Dhillon predicted a ""split ruling"" out of the Supreme Court in the case that will determine the constitutionality of President Biden's COVID-19 OSHA vaccine regulations.

The Supreme Court on Friday heard close to four hours of oral arguments over two of the Biden administration’s vaccine mandates – which have remained under intense legal scrutiny and have been struck down in battles across federal courts.

SUPREME COURT: SOTOMAYOR DENIES BIDEN RULE IS VACCINE MANDATE, DESPITE CLEAR OSHA LANGUAGE

Dhillon, who is personally representing a client in the case, said the justices will likely uphold the mandate requiring health care workers to be vaccinated while overturning the rule applying to private companies with more than 100 employees.

""I think there may be a split ruling out of the court. I think on the case…challenging the large employer mandate, it looks to me like we have five or six votes to enjoin that order,"" she said. ""But on the one regarding medical facilities, because the order is tied to federal funding, I think there are some different arguments there and the justices seem more likely to uphold that OSHA mandate on medical facilities.""

The first phase of Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for employees at applicable companies went into effect Monday despite the ongoing consideration from the High Court.

""Today is day one when the compliance is supposed to be occurring and that’s true for 80 million employees around the country,"" Dhillon said, ""so the fact the court is still sitting on this and hasn’t ruled yet produces tremendous expense, uncertainty, stress and disruption to the American economy. I really hope for the sake of all those employees, employers that the court rules quickly so that we can move on and arrange our affairs accordingly.""

If the court elects to strike down both mandates, Dhillon said ""there will be many states, probably New York, California and other states, that decide it’s within their power to order this type of thing and we will have a fresh round of litigation over it.

""Meanwhile, we all know that this vaccine is not particularly effective against the current version of the virus,"" she said, ""so it all really undermines both citizen confidence in the judiciary and the legislature and in public health. This is really a bad situation for the future of public health in our country, the way the government is handling this particular situation.""",https://www.foxnews.com

mRNA vaccine platform inventor Dr. Robert Malone has been silenced by Big Tech for his take on COVID-19 and the doctor argued on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Monday that it’s just another media miscalculation.

""What the media doesn’t understand is that you can’t suppress information,"" he said. ""It’ll find a way to be free.""

JOE ROGAN LEADS MOVE TO GETTR AFTER TWITTER BANS DR. ROBERT MALONE, REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE

Social media platforms reacted in panic after Malone’s interview with Joe Rogan, in which he applied a theory from Professor Mattias Desmet suggesting how a large population can be sent into ""mass formation psychosis.""

The video was swiftly removed from YouTube, while Malone believes Google search results were also affected.

""It happened so fast, it caught Google with its pants down,"" he said. ""The whole weekend after Rogan posted it, that was fascinating. I had no idea that Rogan was going to put it up on New Year’s Eve, bless his heart, but it just ripped through the world.""

Malone pointed out that the media’s immediate reaction to silence his theory – in order to protect vaccine messaging – only further proved it.

""They absolutely validated Mattias Desmet’s hypothesis,"" he said. ""You couldn’t have asked for more. And it was a perfect storm… they have blown it so badly, in this case.""

This censoring followed Malone's permanent ban from Twitter last week for reportedly violating its COVID-19 misinformation policy. But the platform refused to specify which tweet, in particular, was a violation.

Rogan and Malone have since made the transition to alternative social media app GETTR, with Rogan tweeting ""just in case sh-t over at Twitter gets even dumber, I’m here now as well.""

""GETTR"" trended on Twitter on Sunday as users reacted to Rogan's tweet, with many apparently taking his advice and opening an account. Malone predicted that this is the direction the country is now moving in, expressing high hopes for the upcoming midterms.

""We’ve had all this suppression, and yet we persist,"" he said. ""People don’t tolerate this type of censorship and propaganda that is being pushed on us.""

40,Florida murder trial that ended in mistrial over race is set to start anew,Rebecca Rosenberg,"

The Florida murder trial of a Black man that ended in a mistrial after three jurors allegedly wouldn't convict him of the top charge based on his race is slated to start anew later this month.

A panel of 12 jurors agreed that Dayonte Resiles, 27, stabbed to death Jill Halliburton Su, 59, during a home invasion robbery in 2014 – but they couldn't agree on the charge, the jury forewoman told WSVN 7News.

""[The three jurors] said, 'I don't want to send a young Black male to jail for the rest of their life or have him get the death sentence,'"" the forewoman told the news station of the trial that ended in a hung jury on Dec. 8.

Jury selection for the new trial is slated to begin Jan. 18 in Broward County, records show.

ROBERT DURST DEAD: CONVICTED REAL ESTATE HEIR WAS 78

Initially, nine of the jurors wanted a first-degree murder conviction, but after six days of deliberations they compromised and agreed to find Resiles guilty of manslaughter.

In an unusual twist, the forewoman went rogue. When she returned to the courtroom and was asked to confirm the verdict, she said she couldn't do it.

The 36-year-old mother, who described herself as a mixed-race Puerto Rican, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that she had a knot in the pit of her stomach.

After the clerk announced the manslaughter conviction but before each of the jurors was polled, she looked at the victim's husband and at the defense table.

""[The defense lawyers] were just cheering and patting him on the back, like he graduated high school or made a winning touchdown at a football game,"" she said. ""I thought, what have I done? Is this the world I am creating for my children, a world where someone can get away with murder because of the color of their skin?""

Seconds passed as she locked eyes with the clerk and the judge.

""They're just waiting for my verdict of either ‘yes, I agree’ or ‘no,' and I just couldn't, and that's why I said no,"" she told WSVN 7News.

The judge sent her and the other jurors back to the deliberation room to keep working, but the atmosphere turned hostile, she said.

""You guys keep saying ‘a young Black man,’ but I don't see race. I just see a human being, and you know, one particular person said to me, ‘Hey, if you were outside this courtroom, you would have gotten smacked out in the street for this,’"" she recalled.

Two Black jurors accused her of being racist. For her, the only issue was whether the prosecution proved Resiles' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

""If it was my brother who was accused and the same set of facts was presented, I could have voted guilty of first-degree murder,"" she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. ""That's what the evidence showed. It's not a racial thing. It's a crime. He is the killer. I don't care what race he is.""

Justin Su found his mother's body on Sept. 8, 2014, her legs and hands bound, inside a blood-filled bathtub in their gated Fort Lauderdale community, and called 911. The victim is a distant relative of the founder of Halliburton, the international energy and equipment company.

Her husband, Nan-Yao Su, an entomology professor, was at work, according to an arrest affidavit. Resiles' DNA was found on the knife used to stab her to death and on her green bathrobe belt found inside the house.

The defense argued at trial that the DNA match was a result of evidence contamination. Resiles has a lengthy rap sheet, including for burglaries, records show.

Nothing about Resiles' case has been straightforward. In 2016, he escaped from custody while in court, leading police on a six-day manhunt. He is also charged with trying to manufacture a bogus alibi that would place him in Georgia at the time of the slaying.

The forewoman told WSVN 7News that she hopes the next set of jurors gets it right.

""The society that we're in right now, it needs to change, and just not look at the color of skin,"" she said. ""I feel like we need to look at each other as human beings.""

If convicted, Resiles could face the death penalty. Resiles' attorney Michael Orlando didn't immediately return a request for comment.",https://www.foxnews.com

""I remember someone in front paid for my drink and I turned around and saw a car filled with like 5 teenage girls and I was like nah and ended it,"" another user recalled.

""This happened to me once and I got flustered and just said thank you and drove off,"" another user wrote.

OVER 900 DAIRY QUEEN CUSTOMERS 'PAY IT FORWARD' AT MINNESOTA DRIVE-THRU

TikTok users who are in favor of the pay it forward trend offered alternative suggestions like paying for a portion of another customer’s order or tipping baristas with the total value of your drink.

Several commenters who claim to be current or former drive-thru employees shared that pay it forward lines make the checkout process more complicated.

An Arizona nurse who was fired for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine for religious reasons called the religious exemption process an ""overreach"" and ""beyond intrusive"" as hospitals nationwide grapple with staffing shortages.

ARIZONA HOSPITAL'S ‘STAFFING CRISIS’ MEANS COVID-POSITIVE, SYMPTOMATIC EMPLOYEES PERMITTED TO WORK

Kaitlin Elcock joined ""Fox & Friends First"" to discuss her termination from Mayo Clinic, alongside hundreds of her former colleagues, even as a major provider in the state permits hospital staff infected with COVID-19 to continue working.

""It was heart-wrenching. It was devastating,"" Elcock told Todd Piro and Ashley Strohmier. ""The whole process of the religious exemption was beyond intrusive, and I feel like it put my religion and my faith on trial, and that's complete overreach from Mayo and should not have happened in the first place.""

SUPREME COURT: SOTOMAYOR DENIES BIDEN RULE IS VACCINE MANDATE, DESPITE CLEAR OSHA LANGUAGE

Elcock highlighted the hypocrisy surrounding her firing, claiming Mayo is allowing COVID-positive workers to continue working during their shifts.

""It's super unfortunate because there are vaccinated coworkers who have been exposed, and they're waiting for their test result to come back, and they're still allowing them to come to work,"" Elcock explained.

""Their test result is coming back positive toward the end of the shift, and they've already worked that whole shift with the patient, and they're not even sending them home,"" she continued.

Strohmier noted that allowing COVID-positive staff to continue working is not Mayo's official policy.



Dignity Health, however, a hospital system in Arizona but based in California, reportedly said it would allow COVID-positive hospital workers with mild symptoms to continue working citing the CDC's ""third tier"" guidelines.

43,Small Iowa city sees economic boom amid immigration surge,Griff Jenkins,"

There's a remarkable shift happening in one of the most unlikely places: the small, quiet, snow-covered city of Storm Lake in Northwest Iowa.

Like the majority of the Hawkeye State, Storm Lake was predominantly Caucasian 20 years ago -- but today, over 50 percent of its population of some 10,000 are immigrants, mostly Hispanic. And, while Storm Lake isn't Ellis Island, the opportunity for jobs -- especially in one of its two meatpacking plants -- has drawn people recently from as far as Micronesia.

Before the turn of the century, Mayor Mike Porsch recalled his high school graduating class at Storm Lake High School as close to 100 percent Caucasian.

Now, he's anticipating this year's graduating class will be somewhere near 75 percent non-Caucasian, and he's fully embracing the cultural balance of his town because he sees it as the key to survival and growth.

""If you want to grow in a rural area, you're going to need immigration to support your businesses and the economics in your community,"" Porsch said.

He added that it's vital not just to employ immigrants, but also to incorporate and include immigration in communities to avoid the ""us vs. them"" mentality.

And consider this -- a decade ago, Storm Lake's unemployment hovered near 5 percent, and has since dropped just below 2 percent.

Silvino Morelos is the owner of Valentina's Meat Market across the street from City Hall. It resembles the fully stocked bodegas that many remembered from their home countries before coming to Storm Lake -- brimming with homemade foods such as tamales and hard-to-get products including Vietnamese rice paper.

THE ECONOMY UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, BY THE NUMBERS

Morelos moved here 26 years ago from Los Angeles and said he's hoping to retire here one day because he ""loves this community"" where he's felt safe.

His wife, who's helped him run the market, used to work down the street at one of the two plants for Tyson Foods -- the main employer here.

Perhaps the biggest indicator that diversity has been thriving in this community: the number of languages spoken -- 23 -- in this tiny school district of less than 3,000. The languages include Spanish, French, Chinese, Russian, Filipino, Arabic and range of others such as Burmese, Cebuano, Chuukese, Central Khmer and Mayan languages that can be hard to find a translator for in rural Iowa.

Storm Lake Schools Superintendent Stacey Cole said while there have been some anti-immigrant instances from outside groups or schools, the kids really have embraced each other -- with the most special moments often coming at lunchtime when they get to learn about each other’s cultures and traditions.

""We actually call ourselves America's School, and we call ourselves that because we believe this is the story of America happening inside these walls every single day,"" Cole said.

As for this year's election, Porsch said he isn't expecting a dramatic change overnight -- and this county went heavily in favor of Donald Trump four years ago.

But, Cole noted the addition of two Hispanic board members -- and says her husband, who became the police chief just this month, taught himself Spanish so he could read the morning radio traffic reports in two languages.",https://www.foxnews.com

FIRE AT SIBERIAN ARMS DEPOT TRIGGERS MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS; 8 INJURED, ONE MISSING

Russia’s Tass news agency reported that there were five victims. Some reports suggested two people have died, but that remains unconfirmed.

Medical officials told the agency that one victim is an elderly woman, while the other four victims – two policemen and two members of the military, are severely injured.

Authorities reportedly also declared an evacuation from a nearby village of Kamyanka due to the adverse weather conditions.

US ENDS ARMS TREATY WITH RUSSIA

The latest incident comes just days after massive explosions were recorded at the same facility, injuring at least eight people and prompting the evacuation of thousands on Monday.

Russia's Defense Ministry said a fire triggered the explosions at a storage facility for gunpowder charges near the city of Achinsk in eastern Siberia's Krasnoyarsk region.

Video posted online of the explosion reportedly shows the shock wave traveling through low-hanging clouds in the area.

Authorities declared a state of emergency in the region and ordered the evacuation of residents of several districts in Achinsk, as well as towns and villages within 12.4 miles of the depot.

Regional Gov. Alexander Uss said 6,000 people were being evacuated under the order.

Ammunition depot explosions are not unusual in Russia. After the most recent incident in May 2018, a fire raged for almost a week before water drops from military aircraft and helicopters helped put out the blaze.

President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that would cut federal funding to colleges and universities that don't curb anti-Semitism against Jewish students.

Trump's new order is set to hit the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement head-on. It invoked Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to fight anti-Semitic rhetoric on college campuses and called on federally funded agencies to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism in cases of discrimination.

""This is my message to universities,"" Trump said during a Hanukkah reception at the White House. ""If you want to accept the tremendous amount of federal funding you get every year, you must reject anti-Semitism.""

TRUMP TO 4,000 ISRAELI AMERICANS IN FLORIDA: US-ISRAEL RELATIONSHIP IS 'STRONGER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE'

Trump's executive order came a day after two people opened fire inside a Jewish supermarket in Jersey City, N.J.

The shootout left six people dead, including the shooters, three bystanders and New Jersey Police Detective Joseph Seals, who was shot in the head and upper arm at a nearby cemetery before the suspects took off for the kosher supermarket. The mayor said late Tuesday that the market was ""targeted,"" but officials noted Wednesday that investigators were not prepared to elaborate on the motive behind the incident.

Addressing the violence in New Jersey, Trump said Wednesday that Americans mourned ""with one heart"" for those who died in the shooting and vowed to combat anti-Semitic violence in the country.

""With one voice, we vow to crush anti-Semitism wherever and whenever it appears,"" he said.

Trump's executive order drew bipartisan praise with David Krone, the chief of staff to former Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., saying: ""I know people are going to criticize me for saying this, but I have to give credit where credit is due.""

The Trump administration has received praise from both sides of the aisle but also had critics saying the new executive order violated free-speech rights.

HALEY SUGGESTS CANADA MADE 'DEAL WITH THE DEVIL' BY BACKING ANTI-ISRAEL UN RESOLUTION

Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a left-leaning group, blasted the measure as having ""a chilling effect on free speech"" and a ""crackdown on campus critics of Israel.""

A pro-Palestinian organization accused Trump of trying to ""silence Palestinian-rights activism"" by equating opposition to Israeli treatment of Palestinians with anti-Semitism.

“Israeli apartheid is a very hard product to sell in America, especially in progressive spaces,” Munayyer said in a statement published by The New York Times. “And realizing this, many Israeli apartheid apologists, Trump included, are looking to silence a debate they know they can’t win.”

UN RELEASES FIRST-EVER REPORT ON ANTI-SEMITISM HIGHLIGHTING UPTICK

Jewish Coalition national chairman Norm Coleman, a former Republican senator from Minnesota, said the executive order will have a real and positive impact in protecting Jewish college students from anti-Semitism.

""Sadly, every day, Jewish students on college campuses face outrageous attacks on their Jewish identity and beliefs,"" he said. ""The rapid increase in such incidents in recent years is of great concern.""

47,RNC mulls requiring candidates to avoid debates hosted by Commission on Presidential Debates,Paul Steinhauser,"

The Republican National Committee (RNC) is taking aim at the organization that for more than three decades has hosted and produced the presidential and vice presidential general election debates.

In a letter from the RNC to the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) that Fox News obtained on Thursday, the committee said that it will require its presidential candidates running in the 2024 election cycle to pledge not to participate in debates run by the CPD.

If the RNC follows through with their pledge, it could likely lead to a massive shift in how presidential and vice presidential general election debates are conducted.

PELOSI PRAISES BIDEN'S HEATED ATLANTA ELECTION OVERHAUL SPEECH AS ‘FABULOUS’

""The RNC has a duty to ensure that its future presidential nominees have the opportunity to debate their opponents on a level playing field,"" RNC chair Ronna McDaniel writes in the letter. ""So long as the CPD appears intent on stonewalling the meaningful reforms necessary to restore its credibility with the Republican Party as a fair and nonpartisan actor, the RNC will take every step to ensure that future Republican presidential nominees are given that opportunity elsewhere.""

The RNC’s letter, which was first reported by the New York Times, was fueled by longstanding complaints from then-President Donald Trump and GOP officials over how the 2020 presidential debates were conducted. And the letter was sent after months of talks between the RNC and the commission.

SINEMA DOUBLES DOWN ON FILIBUSTER SUPPORT, DEALING LIKELY FATAL BLOW TO DEMS' ELECTION BILLS

Responding to the letter, the commission told Fox News that ""the CPD deals directly with candidates for president and vice president who qualify for participation in the CPD’s general election debates. The CPD’s plans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues.""

The move by the RNC requiring Republican presidential candidates to refuse to take part in CPD debates is expected to be voted on by committee members when the RNC holds its winter meeting early next month in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) responded to the move by the RNC

""Republicans can’t win a fair fight and they know it. After years of having their toxic policies exposed on the national stage, the RNC has decided they would rather hide their ideas and candidates from voters. And during the last presidential election, the Republicans decided to not have a platform for the first time ever so it’s a natural progression, first no platform and now no debates,"" DNC chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement to Fox News.

""Regardless of the RNC’s tantrum, voters can count on hearing from President Biden and Vice President Harris who are proud of their records,"" Harrison noted.

The mask upgrade comes as omicron cases around the country continue to increase.

Omicron, however, remains one of the weaker COVID strains in terms of virulence, but it is highly contagious.

50,"These N95 masks aren't likely to stop coronavirus, health experts say",Shawn Carter,"

Not all N95 masks are effective in defending against the coronavirus.

Face masks with exhalation valves, instead of blocking particles that could spread COVID-19, actually allow the wearer’s germs to spread, according to health experts. Their ability to release large respiratory droplets in the air has some worried, including San Francisco health officer Dr. Tomás Aragón, who even signed an order in May warning of the potential dangers of these particular masks.

""Any mask that incorporates a one-way valve (typically a raised plastic cylinder about the size of a quarter on the front or side of the mask) that is designed to facilitate easy exhaling allows droplets to be released from the mask, putting others nearby at risk,"" the order reads.

OPTIMUS INSTANT HAND SANITIZER RECALLED FOR METHANOL RISK

ANNA CAMP, WHO CONTRACTED COVID-19 AFTER NOT WEARING A MASK 'ONE TIME,' HAS A WARNING: 'IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE’

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance states that standard N95 respirators reduce the wearer's exposure by filtering out around 95 percent of air particles, while those with exhalation valves allow “unfiltered exhaled air to escape into the sterile field.""

Dr. Matthew L. Springer, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told the San Francisco Chronicle that masks with these values are “practically useless.”

“Given that most of the value of these masks is not to protect the wearer but to protect others from a potentially contagious asymptomatic wearer, those one-way valves make the masks practically useless for protecting others,” he said. “So all those potentially contagious people are spewing unfettered large respiratory droplets, probably even in a concentrated stream going through the valves.”

Liberals across the Twitter sphere reacted with anger, attacks on Republicans, and calls for Democrats to pack the Supreme Court following the nation’s highest court’s decision to block President Biden’s vaccine mandate on businesses with over 100 employees.

""The Supreme Court's conservative majority has chosen to prolong and deepen the misery of the pandemic,"" the social justice association Alliance For Justice tweeted in response to the 6-3 ruling on Thursday that blocked Biden’s mandate. ""The people need their courts back. #ExpandtheCourt.""

ARMY HAS RELIEVED SIX ACTIVE-DUTY LEADERS, INCLUDING TWO BATTALION COMMANDERS, FOR REFUSING VACCINE

""Republicans want to prolong the pandemic - have more people get sick and die - so they can blame Biden and win an election,"" Former DNC Comms Director and Obama surrogate Brad Woodhouse tweeted. ""And the Supreme Court just helped them. Disgraceful.""

Former Hillary Clinton adviser Zac Petkanas accused the court of ""prolonging the pandemic"" while others blamed former President Trump and called on Biden to act.

The Supreme Court issued mixed rulings in a pair of cases challenging Biden administration COVID-19 vaccine mandates, allowing the requirement for certain health care workers to go into effect while blocking enforcement of a mandate for businesses with 100 or more employees.

The latter, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule that took effect on Monday, said that businesses with at least 100 employees needed to require workers to get vaccinated, or get tested weekly and wear a mask.

The Court ruled that OSHA lacked the authority to impose such a mandate because the law that created OSHA ""empowers the Secretary to set workplace safety standards, not broad public health measures.""

52,Waukesha Christmas parade suspect Darrell Brooks slapped with 71 new charges,Adam Sabes,"

Waukesha Christmas parade suspect Darrell Brooks is now facing 71 new charges after prosecutors filed an amended complaint on Wednesday.

The new charges include 61 counts of 1st degree recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run involving death, two bail jumping felonies, and two counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse charges.

In total, Brooks now faces 77 charges.

WAUKESHA CHRISTMAS PARADE SUSPECT DARRELL BROOKS CHARGED WITH SIXTH COUNT OF INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE

Brooks previously was charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide on Nov. 23, after allegedly driving his maroon Ford Escape into a crowd of people at a Christmas parade in Waukesha. At the time, he was allegedly fleeing the scene of a separate domestic incident.

In total, six people died in the incident on Nov. 21, including one young child.

Wilhelm Hospel, 81, Virginia Sorenson, 79; LeAnna Owen, 71; Tamara Durand, 52, Jane Kulich, 52, and Jackson Sparks, 8, were killed.

Brooks is scheduled to appear in court on Friday for a preliminary hearing in the case.

Brooks has a criminal record dating back to 1999, and was convicted of statutory sexual seduction in 2006 after having sex with a 15-year-old girl, who later became pregnant.

53,NYC Burger King murder suspect arrested in death of 19-year-old woman: 'Makes your blood boil',Audrey Conklin,"

New York City authorities on Friday announced they have arrested a suspect in the Sunday morning killing of 19-year-old Kristal Bayron-Nieves.

Winston Glynn, 30, has been charged with murdering Bayron-Nieves and criminal possession of a weapon. He has four prior arrests on charges of menacing, criminal possession of a weapon, assault and criminal mischief, authorities said during a press conference Friday.

Glynn is accused of shooting Bayron-Nieves, who was working at a Burger King in Harlem after midnight, while she was struggling to unlock a cash register he demanded she open.

""When you see the video and think of this … senseless, brutal killing of a teenager who was doing the right thing — working on a Saturday night at 12:30 only to have her life cut short — it makes your blood boil and shocks your senses,"" NYPD Chief of Detectives James W. Essig said.

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAPTURES SUSPECT IN NYC BURGER KING SHOOTING

Authorities could not save Bayron-Nieves after they were called to the Burger King just before 1 a.m. Sunday and began to ""canvas the area in search of the subject using a picture obtained from the security camera.""

Glynn was seen in the security camera footage wearing a black ski mask and black jacket with white earphones hanging out his pocket — a small detail that ultimately led to his arrest, authorities said during the press conference.

Glynn used to work at the same Burger King location in 2020, but there is no indication he knew the victim, police said.

The suspect walked into the fast-food restaurant early Sunday, brandishing a gun and immediately pistol-whipped the store's manager and a customer on his way to the cash register Bayron-Nieves was operating. He stole about $100 from one cash register before shooting the teenager. He also stole the manager's phone before fleeing the store.

The suspect was wearing different clothing in security camera footage caught before the shooting but still had white earphones hanging from his pocket. Police used that footage to identify a person of interest and later confirmed that he was a prior employee of the restaurant.

Newly elected Mayor Eric Adams said police understood that ""Kristal was not just a number"" amid the city's other killings.

Adams, who met with Bayron-Nieves' mother, Kristie Nieves, called the case ""personal"" and praised police for their ""old-fashioned commitment"" to apprehending the perpetrator.

""We're not going to have our city return to violence,"" he said. ""That's a promise I made as a candidate and a promise I'm going to keep as mayor.""

Bayron-Nieves had been a cashier at the Burger King for only three weeks and had already requested a day shift because she was afraid of being on the night shift, according to her family.

Kristie Nieves told the New York Post in Spanish through a translator that the girl had feared for her safety because she was young and ""she has more than 50 homeless people sleeping in front of the store.""

Nieves said she feels guilty because she encouraged her daughter to go to work that day even though she was frightened.

The assignment instructions said that the essay had to be ""one page"" and that students were not allowed to answer the question in ""any other way.""

The prompt said further, ""Any attempt to avoid this prompt as written; or trying to argue otherwise will result in a failing grade. If you have any questions on the pedagogy behind this assignment– please contact me.""

57,US considering using military bases to house illegal immigrant children nabbed at border: report,Gregg Re,"

Several U.S. military bases may soon house illegal immigrant children caught crossing the border, two government officials told the Associated Press.

The Health and Human Services Department is also considering using the bases to shelter children who were separated from their parents while illegally entering the country, the officials reportedly said.

Illegal immigrant children are often separated from their parents for their own welfare, or because their parents are facing criminal charges.

The sources discussed the plan Tuesday on condition of anonymity because it has not been made public or made final.

Health and Human Services is a federal agency that oversees approximately 100 shelters in more than a dozen states for children seized at the border. The agency's mission is to ensure the health of Americans and provide critical services.

HHS has temporarily used military bases for housing in the past. During a surge in children from Central America in 2014, the HHS temporarily used military bases in California, Oklahoma and Texas to house children.

That process was not without its critics. In 2014, Texas officials appealed to the Obama administration to secure the U.S.-Mexico border as waves of illegal immigrant children overwhelmed the system, with one lawmaker saying U.S. military bases effectively have been transformed into camps to handle the influx.

""Our military bases are turning into refugee camps. I never thought I'd see this in the United States of America,"" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said at the time.

WATCH: UNIVERSITY TRAINS STUDENTS TO HELP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

The Department of Homeland Security has limited space to house families that are kept together — only about 2,700 beds at three family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania. In April alone, people who came as families accounted for nearly 10,000 Border Patrol arrests. Another 4,300 were unaccompanied children.

""Our military bases are turning into refugee camps."" — House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul

Nearly 1 in 4 Border Patrol arrests on the Mexican border from October through April was someone who came in a family. That means any large increase in prosecutions will likely cause parents to be separated from their children while they face charges and do time in jail.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended the Trump administration's practice of separating children from parents when the family is being prosecuted for entering the U.S. illegally, telling a Senate committee Tuesday that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens ""in the United States every day.""

Nielsen, who has led the agency since December, came under attack from Democratic senators days after Attorney General Jeff Sessions said a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward people entering the country illegally could lead to more families being split up while parents are prosecuted.

CALIF. LAWMAKER PROPOSES ALLOWING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO SERVE ON STATE BOARDS

In a contentious exchange with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Nielsen said her department was not taking children from parents as a way to deter illegal immigration. Rather, Nielsen said, if a person crosses the border illegally: ""We will refer you for prosecution. You've broken U.S. law.""

When Harris pressed her about what that would mean for a 4-year-old child whose family faces charges of entering the country illegally, Nielsen said, ""What we'll be doing is prosecuting parents who've broken the law, just as we do every day in the United States of America.""

The children are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services within 48 hours, she said. That department then finds people for the children to stay with while the parents are in custody, she said.

59,"Texas hostage situation: All hostages 'alive and safe,' Greg Abbott tweets after hours-long ordeal",Adam Sabes,"

Three remaining hostages at a Texas synagogue were ""out alive and safe,"" ending an ordeal that began hours earlier, according to a Twitter message late Saturday from Gov. Greg Abbott.

""Prayers answered,"" Abbott wrote. ""All hostages are out alive and safe.""

Not long before the governor's message, a loud bang and the sound of gunfire were heard at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, near Fort Worth, as authorities worked to free the hostages, The Associated Press reported.

""The subject is deceased,"" Colleyville police Chief Michael Miller told reporters at a news conference around 11:20 p.m. ET. The identity of the hostage taker was not being immediately released.

Miller said authorities didn't yet know why the suspect selected Congregation Beth Israel for the crime.

The FBI said the suspect was focused on a single issue not directly related to the Jewish community, The Associated Press reported.

More than 200 law enforcement officers had worked on the case Saturday, including hostage-situation negotiators, authorities added.

Just about two hours earlier, a single hostage had been freed, unharmed, giving authorities hope that the situation would end without a bloodshed.

Authorities and others were worried about a repeat of such tragedies as the Tree of Life massacre in Pittsburgh in October 2018, where 11 people were killed, or the Poway, California, synagogue shooting near San Diego in 2019, where there was one fatality.

How it began

Many hours earlier, a Texas SWAT team had responded to Congregation Beth Israel after a suspect entered the house of worship and took hostages during services that were being live-streamed on the Internet.

The suspect was said to be a supporter of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist who was sentenced to 86 years in prison in 2010 for attempting to murder and assault U.S. military personnel and was being held at Federal Medical Center Carswell, at a prison in Fort Worth.

Siddiqui is also referred to as ""Lady al Qaeda.""

As the situation began, Colleyville police wrote on Twitter that all residents in the immediate area of the synagogue were being evacuated.

TEXAS OFFICIALS REACT TO NEWS OF HOSTAGE SITUATION IN COLLEYVILLE SYNAGOGUE

Police posted an additional update at 1:20 p.m. stating the situation was ongoing and advised people to avoid the area.

According to ABC News, the hostages included the rabbi of the synagogue. He was identified by the Dallas Morning News as Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker.

In a statement, Colleyville Police Department Sgt. Dara Nelson said the department received the first call at 10:41 a.m.

As the day progressed, Colleyville police, the FBI’s Dallas Field Office, the Texas Department of Public Safety, North Tarrant Regional SWAT Team, and other agencies responded to the scene.

AUSTIN'S POLICE DEPARTMENT NEEDS MANY MORE OFFICERS, SAYS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION

Law enforcement officials said no injuries were reported, and that FBI crisis negotiators had been in communication with the suspect throughout the ordeal.

The first hostage was released with no injuries shortly after 5 p.m. CT, according to Nelson.

""This man will be reunited with his family as soon as possible and he does not require medical attention,"" the sergeant said.

Livestream: ‘I am going to die. OK?’

The congregation had a Facebook livestream up on its Facebook page for a service that had started three hours prior to the suspect's arrival.

The livestream was soon disabled, but not before a man could be heard repeatedly saying ""I will die.""

""I'm going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die. OK? So don't cry for me,"" the voice said.

Earlier in the livestream, the man, who was not visible, could be heard in what appeared to be a discussion with negotiators about ""releasing"" the people inside.

A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, told Fox News Digital that the company ended the livestream and would also remove any content praising the incident.

""We are in contact with law enforcement as the situation continues to evolve,"" the spokesperson added.

Cytron-Walker, the rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel, has been in his position since 2006, according to the congregation's website.

The synagogue describes itself as an ""intimate, vibrant, growing Reform Jewish congregation that has a lot to offer in terms of religious, social, and educational opportunities for the youngest to our oldest members.""

Reactions in DC and elsewhere

A White House official told Fox News that officials there were ""closely monitoring"" the situation.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams said on Twitter that ""out of an abundance of caution"" the New York Police Department ""has deployed additional resources to key Jewish locations around the city tonight.""

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides tweeted about the incident.

A petition to ""shut down Pornhub"" has reached more than 2.1 million signatures after a Tuscaloosa, Ala., man was charged with producing and posting porn with a minor on the website.

Authorities arrested 27-year-old Michael Terrell Williams on Sept. 15 after an 18-year-old woman told police about a 2018 video on Pornhub that featured her performing sexual acts on Williams, who had a verified Pornhub account, when she was 16, WBMA reported.

The Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office told Fox News on Tuesday that Williams has been released on bond.

Michael Dinsmore of anti-trafficking campaign Exodus Cry told Fox News in a statement that Williams' account was apparently verified through the website's ModelHub program, ""through which Pornhub earns 35 [percent] of the sale of content.""

""Any commercial sex act involving a minor is by definition sex trafficking according to the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The monetized child pornography video was up for two years with over two thousand views,"" Dinsmore added.

The website cooperated with investigators to confirm that the video showed the woman performing sex acts on Williams when she was 16. The video was viewed more than 2,700 times over two years, WBMA reported, citing court documents.

""Pornhub has a steadfast commitment to eradicating any and all illegal content, including under-age material, and actively works to employ state of the art, comprehensive measures to protect its platform from such content,"" a Pornhub spokesperson said in a statement.

He added those measures include a team of human moderators that manually review ""every single upload;"" a system for flagging, reviewing and removing ""all illegal material;"" age-verification tools and various automated technologies including ""CSAI Match, YouTube’s proprietary technology for combating Child Sexual Abuse Imagery content online,"" as well as a number of others.

""The post does not reflect the views of Michigan Democrats and should not be misinterpreted as a statement of support from our elected officials or candidates.""

The state's Republicans were sharply critical of the Democrats' original post.

""Gretchen Whitmer and the Michigan Democrat Party continue to be in the pockets of teachers unions and are so out of touch with Michiganders, they believe parents shouldn’t be involved in their children’s education,"" Michigan GOP communications director Gustavo Portela told Fox News Digital in a Monday statement.

""Studies have shown time and time again that parent involvement leads to student success,"" Portela continued. ""Parent involvement is exactly what our students need now more than ever after a year of learning loss that will impact them for years to come thanks to Gretchen Whitmer’s shutdowns.""

The Wolverine State GOP also torched their political rivals in a Sunday tweet, writing the Democrats are ""ready to indoctrinate your children with what ‘society needs them to know.’""

Republican Governors Association (RGA) spokesman Chris Gustafson told Fox News in a Monday statement that the Democrat Michigan governor must take action over the post.

""Gretchen Whitmer must condemn the Michigan Democrat Party or admit that she believes teachers unions should control public education, not parents,"" Gustafson said.

Republican gubernatorial candidate and former Detroit police chief James Craig released a statement declaring parents the ""true stakeholders"" of their kids' education as well as blasting the Michigan Democrats' post as ""disgraceful"" and demonstrating ""they have an agenda of indoctrination, not education.""

65,No. 1 Nation in Sexy Web Searches? Call it Pornistan,Kelli Morgan,"

This article was updated on July 14.

They may call it the ""Land of the Pure,"" but Pakistan turns out to be anything but.

The Muslim country, which has banned content on at least 17 websites to block offensive and blasphemous material, is the world's leader in online searches for pornographic material, FoxNews.com has learned.

“You won’t find strip clubs in Islamic countries. Most Islamic countries have certain dress codes,” said Gabriel Said Reynolds, professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Notre Dame. “It would be an irony if they haven’t shown the same vigilance to pornography.”

So here's the irony: Google ranks Pakistan No. 1 in the world in searches for pornographic terms, outranking every other country in the world in searches per person for certain sex-related content.

Pakistan is top dog in searches per-person for ""horse sex"" since 2004, ""donkey sex"" since 2007, ""rape pictures"" between 2004 and 2009, ""rape sex"" since 2004, ""child sex"" between 2004 and 2007 and since 2009, ""animal sex"" since 2004 and ""dog sex"" since 2005, according to Google Trends and Google Insights, features of Google that generate data based on popular search terms.

The country also is tops -- or has been No. 1 -- in searches for ""sex,"" ""camel sex,"" ""rape video,"" ""child sex video"" and some other searches that can't be printed here.

Google Trends generates data of popular search terms in geographic locations during specific time frames. Google Insights is a more advanced version that allows users to filter a search to geographic locations, time frames and the nature of a search, including web, images, products and news.

Pakistan ranked No. 1 in all the searches listed above on Google Trends, but on only some of them in Google Insights.

“We do our best to provide accurate data and to provide insights into broad search patterns, but the results for a given query may contain inaccuracies due to data sampling issues, approximations, or incomplete data for the terms entered,” Google said in a statement, when asked about the accuracy of its reports.

The Embassy of Islamic Republic of Pakistan did not reply to a request for an interview.

In addition to banning content on 17 websites, including islamexposed.blogspot.com, Pakistan is monitoring seven other sites -- Google, Yahoo, Bing, YouTube, Amazon, MSN and Hotmail -- for anti-Islamic content, the Associated Press reported in June.

But it’s not to censor the Pakistani people, Reynolds said. It’s to shut out the rest of the world.

“[It] could lead to conversion, which would undermine the very order of the state,” he said. “Part of protecting the society is making sure that there is no way it could be undermined in terms of foreign influences.”

Pakistan temporarily banned Facebook in May when Muslim groups protested the “Everybody Draw Muhammad Day” page, where users were encouraged to upload pictures of the Prophet Muhammad. The page remained on Facebook, but Pakistani users were unable to view it, said Andrew Noyes, manager of Facebook’s Public Policy Communication.

And while Pakistan is taking measures to prevent blasphemous material from being viewed by its citizens, pornographic material is “certainly” contradictory to Islam, too, Reynolds said.

The country’s punishment for those charged with blasphemy is execution, but the question remains what -- if anything -- can be done about people who search for porn on the Web.

“It’s a new phenomenon,” Reynolds said.",https://www.foxnews.com
66,Tucker Carlson says coronavirus response shows how 'identity politics trumped public health',Victor Garcia,"

Tucker Carlson tackled the seriousness of the rising coronavirus crisis Monday, criticizing the mainstream media's coverage of the outbreak.

""For weeks, the media told you it was wrong to worry about the coronavirus, a mysterious, highly communicable lethal disease spreading rapidly around the world ...

CORONAVIRUS INFECTIONS SURGE IN ITALY, SOUTH KOREA AS VIRUS KILLS AT LEAST 8 IN IRAN

Carlson was referencing the critics and journalists who argued that concern over the virus, which originated in China, had racially biased connotations.

""Countless publications wagged their fingers in the face of readers and told them it was irrational, probably immoral, in fact, to worry more about the coronavirus than the annual flu,"" Carlson said. ""Identity politics trumped public health and not for the first time. Wokeness is a cult. They let you die before they admitted that diversity is not our strength.""

The host highlighted how the coronavirus has spread and impacted other countries around the world.

""What began as a regional outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China, is now spreading across Europe. Parts of Italy are shut down tonight. Catholic services and, in some places, funerals have been suspended indefinitely,"" Carlson said. ""South Korea has confirmed close to a thousand cases of the disease so far. Japan is reporting infections at the same level. The virus has even been reported in Iran.""

""Apparently, international sanctions don't stop the coronavirus,"" Carlson added.

Carlson even informed viewers that an outbreak was possible inside the United States.

""On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control warned that it is, 'possible, even likely' that America will have a general coronavirus outbreak as well,"" Carlson said. ""Officials in our country have reported about three dozen cases of the virus in the U.S. so far. But that's a misleading number. The truth is, we have no real idea how many Americans are infected. Why? Here's why. As of yesterday, only three public health labs in the entire country were properly equipped to detect the virus.""

69,"Arkansas inmates sue saying they were prescribed ivermectin to treat COVID-19, told it was 'vitamins'",Stephen Sorace,"

An Arkansas jail and its doctor have been sued after four inmates claimed they were prescribed ivermectin to treat COVID-19 without their consent after being told the medications were ""vitamins.""

The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas filed the lawsuit in federal court on Thursday on behalf of the inmates. Those named in the suit were the Washington County jail, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder and Dr. Robert Karas.

HOW TO GET AN AT-HOME COVID-19 TEST

The lawsuit states that after the detainees tested positive for COVID-19 in August 2021 they were told they were being given ""’vitamins,’ ‘antibiotics,’ and/or ‘steroids.""’ The inmates claim they were never told ivermectin was among the medications in their treatment.

But in August, Helder revealed that ivermectin had been prescribed to inmates to treat their COVID-19.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ivermectin for use by people and animals for some parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions. The FDA has not approved its use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. According to the FDA, side effects for the drug include skin rash, nausea and vomiting.

""The truth, however, was that without knowing and voluntary consent, plaintiffs ingested incredibly high doses of a drug that credible medical professionals, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all agree is not an effective treatment against COVID-19, and that if given in large doses is dangerous for humans,"" the lawsuit said.

The four inmates suffered side effects from taking the drug including vision issues, diarrhea and stomach cramps, according to the lawsuit. The inmates are asking that they receive a medical evaluation by a provider not affiliated with Karas.

Karas has said he began giving ivermectin at the jail in November 2020. In a September letter sent by his attorney, Karas told a Medical Board investigator that 254 inmates at the jail had been treated with ivermectin.

The state Medical Board has been investigating complaints against Karas over the jail’s use of ivermectin, and is expected to discuss the investigation at its February meeting.

70,Dramatic 14-point shift in party preference during 2021 gives GOP biggest lead since 1995: Gallup,Michael Lee,"

Republicans overtook Democrats as America's preferred political party during the last quarter of 2021, with the GOP holding its largest lead in voter preference since 1995.

Republicans held a 47-42 lead in voter identification at the end of 2021, according to a Gallup Poll released Monday, a dramatic shift from the beginning of the year, when Democrats held a 49-40 edge in the metric.

KAYLEIGH MCENANY ON BIDEN'S STUNNING POLL NUMBERS: 'THIS IS A FIVE-ALARM FIRE'

A lead in voter preference by Republicans has been a rarity since Gallup first began posing the question to voters in 1991. The last GOP lead of this size, at the beginning of 1995, was shortly after the GOP regained control of the House for the first time in decades. Republicans are looking to repeat the accomplishment in 2022.

The numbers include both those who affiliate with each party and those who lean towards one of the two parties. Independents remain the largest political group in the U.S., with the percentage of voters who identify as independent continuing to grow in recent years.

Gallup noted that the shift in party preferences largely tracked the approval rating of President Biden, who started his term in January with high ratings but saw them fall amid growing concerns over the pandemic, the military's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and rising inflation.

Despite the country seemingly trending towards the GOP throughout 2021, Democrats still held a net advantage over the average of all four quarters of the year. That advantage has been consistent since Gallup began posing the question to voters in 1991, with that first year being the lone time Republicans enjoyed more support than Democrats over the course of an entire year. The parties enjoyed roughly equal support from 2001-2003 and again in 2010-2011.

Gallup also noted that the Republican advantage may be starting to decline, with the party's latest monthly estimate showing the GOP with only a two-point lead over Democrats.

Los Angeles police have identified the suspected killer of 24-year-old Brianna Kupfer, a UCLA grad student stabbed to death at her furniture store job last week.

Shawn Laval Smith, 31, should be considered armed and dangerous, according to the LAPD.

Los Angeles County Jail records show Covina police arrested him on Oct. 27, 2020, on a misdemeanor charge. He was released on $1,000 bail. The outcome of that case was not immediately clear.

A law enforcement source tells Fox News Digital that Smith has a rap sheet that spans both coasts, including in San Francisco and South Carolina. His most recent charge is allegedly for shoplifting -- and he landed up in jail in San Mateo after allegedly assaulting a police officer.

Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Smith allegedly walked into a furniture store on North La Brea Avenue on Jan. 13 and stabbed Kupfer to death moments after she texted a friend to say a man in the store was making her uncomfortable.

""She sent a text to a friend letting her know that there was someone inside the location that was giving her a bad vibe,"" LAPD Lt. John Radtke said of the Jan. 13 slaying. ""Regrettably, that person did not see the text immediately.""

72,Where is the laptop stolen from Nancy Pelosi's office?,Danielle Wallace,"

The whereabouts of the laptop nabbed from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 remained unknown Wednesday, a day after a 22-year-old woman from Pennsylvania was slapped with additional, heftier charges for allegedly removing the device from the building and plotting to have it sold off to a Russian spy agency.

Riley June Williams, from Harrisburg, Pa., was charged with theft of government property and obstruction by U.S. Attorney Christian Haughsby during a court hearing on Tuesday, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Those charges could land Williams in prison for up to 20 years if convicted, according to the newspaper.

Williams was first arrested Monday after she reportedly turned herself in. She was initially charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, authorities said.

SEARCH FOR PELOSI'S OFFICE LAPTOP ALLEGEDLY STOLEN BY PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN DURING CAPITOL RIOT CONTINUES

She is accused of removing a Hewlett-Packard-brand laptop from Pelosi’s office at the U.S. Capitol. A witness, identified as Williams’ ""former romantic partner,"" told FBI investigators that Williams intended to send the laptop stolen from Pelosi’s office to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, the amended statement of facts submitted in court claims.

""According to W1, the transfer of the computer device to Russia fell through for unknown reasons and WILLIAMS still has the computer device or destroyed it. This matter remains under investigation,"" the document states.

The FBI did not return a Fox News request for comment Wednesday.

A video clip from a broadcast by British television network ITV reposted on YouTube showed a woman believed to be Williams -- wearing a green T-shirt and brown trench coat and carrying a black-and-white-striped zebra-print bag over her shoulders -- inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the amended statement submitted Tuesday to U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Meriweather.

NANCY PELOSI SAYS SHE'S 'NOT CONCERNED' ABOUT LAPTOP ALLEGEDLY STOLEN DURING CAPITOL RIOT

Williams repeatedly yelled, ""Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs,"" while directing a group of intruders up the staircase leading to Pelosi’s office. Additional photos obtained by the FBI purportedly showed Williams wearing the same outfit in other areas both inside and outside of the Capitol.

A video believed to be recorded and live-streamed by Williams had the camera directed toward a wooden desk with an ""HP"" laptop. Text across the clip reads: ""they got the laptop."" The Justice Department shared a screenshot of the video.

Williams is also accused of bragging about stealing the laptop on the social media platform Discord.

""I stole sh** from Nancy Polesi [sic],"" one message reportedly said. Another, posted by a user named ""Riley,"" allegedly stated: ""I took Polesis [sic] hard drives.""

Security camera footage also showed Williams both entering and exiting Pelosi’s office on Jan. 6, the document -- written by an FBI special agent at the Manassas, Va., office, with the Cyber Crime Section -- states. The agent’s name was redacted from the amended document.

On Jan. 8, Pelosi’s Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill confirmed via Twitter that ""a laptop from a conference room was stolen,"" adding: ""It was a laptop that was only used for presentations.""

""I’m not concerned about that particular laptop,"" Pelosi told MSNBC reporter Joy Reid in an interview that aired Tuesday. ""But that doesn’t matter. It could be any laptop and anytime … a constituent writes to a member of Congress it’s confidential … and for them to take that is a violation not only of my office but of my connection to my constituents.""

Alexander Acs, 33, was booked into the Orange County Jail on a first-degree murder charge and is expected to have additional attempted murder and robbery/carjacking charges added, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies were initially called around 10 a.m. Sunday to an armed carjacking near Orlando, where Acs is accused of slashing the victim with a box cutter and stealing their car. The victim, whose name was not released by authorities, was rushed to a local area hospital and is expected to survive.

He later rode with detectives to the 4400 block of S. Rio Grande Ave where they found a badly decomposed body, according to the sheriff's office.

Deputies said Acs arrived in central Florida on Jan. 7 and was looking for an ex-girlfriend who had pressed charges against him in the Tampa area. Acs said he wanted to ""take everything from her"" and leave the country, according to an arrest affidavit.

While in central Florida, Acs stayed with someone in the area who was not identified in the affidavit, when he apparently became upset with the man.

After the alleged killing, Acs told authorities he ""wandered Orlando, sleeping in the woods"" as he attempted to track down a male friend of his ex-girlfriend.

Acs attempted to contact the man on Sunday, which led to the carjacking, according to the affidavit.

CNN prides itself as a network that sticks to the facts and informs its audience nothing but the truth, but its newest hire may be undercutting that message.

Rex Chapman, a former NBA player and host of ""Block or Charge"" on Adult Swim, has become better known in recent years as a left-wing Twitter personality, particularly for sharing viral video critics have long said are taken without crediting the content creators in order to amplify his own brand.

CNN announced on Tuesday that Chapman will be joining its new streaming service set to launch later this year, highlighting his ""humor and positivity"" on social media. One of his new colleagues, CNN's go-to misinformation correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, dubbed Chapman ""the king of Twitter.""

SOCIAL MEDIA LIGHTS UP CNN FOR HIRING ‘ENDLESS SOURCE OF MISINFORMATION' REX CHAPMAN FOR STREAMING SERVICE

But his Twitter activity goes far beyond ""humor and positivity."" And perhaps he should be given a different name: ""the king of misinformation.""

For several years, Chapman has peddled inaccurate and misleading claims, often times without any remorse, in order to push a narrative and fuel liberal outrage mobs with the help of his 1.1 million followers.

In honor of his new role, here are seven instances where Chapman pushed misinformation on social media.

Falsely claims Louisville Police were at the ""wrong house"" before Breonna Taylor shooting.

During the civil unrest following the death of George Floyd, the police-involved shooting of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky from earlier in the year was revisited.

Taylor was killed in March 2020 as a result of a shootout between Louisville police and her boyfriend stemming from a search warrant in a drug-dealing investigation.

CNN'S PAUL BEGALA: DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE 'BAD LEADERS,' THEY HAVE 'BAD FOLLOWERS'

Chapman took aim at Taylor's ""killers"" with a blatantly false claim.

""Guys, never forget that Breonna Taylor’s killers were at the wrong house. The wrong house,"" Chapman dramatically tweeted.

One Twitter user corrected Chapman telling him, ""Rex I love you. But they had the right address and apartment. Her name was on the warrant."" He then replied, ""Unfollow please.""

Regardless, the tweet received over 80,000 likes and over 17,000 retweets.

Alleging the GOP was responsible for locked mailboxes during the 2020 election

In the months leading up to the 2020 election, liberals pushed a narrative that the Trump administration, under the direction of postmaster general Louis DeJoy, was limiting the number of mailboxes in cities across the country to stifle mail-in voting, which was popular among Democrats during the COVID pandemic.

URBAN DICTIONARY TURNS VOX'S AARON 'RUPAR' INTO A VERB: 'TO PURPOSEFULLY MISLEAD,' 'MISCHARACTERIZE' VIDEO

Chapman served his part in promoting the falsehood, sharing a photo of mailboxes in Burbank, Calif., with locks on them and calling on then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to take action.

""In your entire life have you ever seen a LOCKED mailbox at the USPS?"" Chapman asked in August 2020. ""A disgrace and immediate threat to American democracy. Shame on them. Shame on the GOP. Where are you @senatemajldr ?""

Chapman ultimately deleted the tweet, but not before it received over 20,000 retweets. He even mocked those who were calling out his dishonest suggestion as to why the locks were placed on mailboxes, which was actually a practice that began in 2016 due to rising theft and vandalism.

Taking Lindsey Graham grossly out of context about pro-life women

Following the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., offered a staunch defense for pro-life women.

""You know what I like about Judge Barrett? She's got everything,"" Graham said on the campaign trail in November 2020 just before the election. ""She's not just wicked smart. She's incredibly good. She embraces her faith.""

""I want every young woman to know there's a place for you in America if you're pro-life, if you embrace your religion, and you follow traditional family structure,"" Graham added, referring to women if they felt alienated based on their beliefs.

CNN'S JAKE TAPPER PANNED FOR FINALLY SAYING COVID HOSPITALIZATION STATS ARE ‘MISLEADING’: ‘TWO YEARS TOO LATE’

As Graham's remarks were being twisted by Twitter users, Chapman only amplified the narrative that he was saying only women who had certain beliefs would be accepted in Graham's America.

""Lindsey Graham tells young women that, ‘There’s a place for you in America — if you are pro-life — if you embrace your religion and you follow traditional family structure’. What a bad guy,"" Chapman wrote.

Even when journalists reacted to Chapman's tweet claiming he and others were ""willfully misinterpreting"" Graham's comments, he simply replied, ""Nope.""

Amplifies doctored video showing military band celebrating Trump's ouster

Just days before President Biden took office, a video shared by Twitter use Cathay Dawkins went viral that purportedly showing a ""military band"" performing the song ""Hit the Road Jack,"" right outside the White House.

A fact-check from the Associated Press debunked the video, which lifted the audio from the Ohio State University Marching Band. A military spokesperson said the Army Band was rehearsing the ""National Emblem.""

CNN AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD YEAR

But that didn't stop Chapman from sharing it, helping the video reach nearly 4 million views on Twitter.

""Perfect. Trump's last day,"" Chapman tweeted.

Even when critics told Chapman he shared a doctored video, he tweeted, ""No way.""

That tweet was shared roughly 30,000 times and received a whopping 112,000 likes.

Falsely accusing Mitch McConnell of not promoting mask-wearing during the pandemic

In July 2021, McConnell offered a full-throated endorsement of the coronavirus vaccines, sharing a video of remarks he made to reporters and tweeting, ""Get vaccinated! These shots need to get into arms as rapidly as possible, or else we're gonna be back in a situation this fall like what we went through last year.""

That tweet didn't sit well with Chapman.

""This dude didn’t wear a mask publicly for MONTHS AND MONTHS while the former guy was in office,"" Chapman wrote. ""He went right along with whatever the former guy said and did with regard to COVID. He knew all of this s--t then. So why now?""

Without a hint of irony, Chapman called McConnell a ""misinformation scourge.""

Critics were quick to fact-check Chapman, sharing reports from May 2020 showing McConnell promoting mask-wearing.

""There’s no stigma attached to wearing a mask. There’s no stigma attached to staying six feet apart,"" McConnell said at the time.

CNN TERMINATES CHRIS CUOMO ‘EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY’

Even CNN's star fact-checker Daniel Dale had to debunk Chapman's tweet, saying ""This is not true.""

Despite being told McConnell was actually ""very serious"" about wearing a mask on Capitol Hill, Chapman reacted, ""He shoulda been doing that in [K]entucky,"" which he also did according to a June 2020 report in Louisville's Courier-Journal.

Promoting falsehood cop ""planted"" evidence against Black driver

Days after making his false accusations against McConnell, Chapman reacted to a 14-second cell phone video showing an exchange between a police officer and a driver filming him during a traffic stop, showing the officer tossing something to the back seat. The tweet read ""Cop caught in 4K planting evidence,"" to which Chapman shared with his followers and asked, ""Tell me again how you reform this??""

Bodycam footage from the same officer showed that he only tossed a plastic bag that was emptied after it was pulled from another suspect who was riding in the car.

""It was in his pocket and I don’t want to hold onto it. It’s on their bodycam that they took it off of him,"" the officer is heard saying to the driver, a comment that was omitted in the viral video.

The driver was cited with a speeding ticket and no arrests were made. And while the viral video was ultimately taken down, Chapman's tweet remains, capturing over 12,000 retweets in the process.

COVID alarmism vs COVID hypocrisy

Chapman, like many prominent liberals, was quick to scold others who did not take the coronavirus pandemic seriously.

In September 2021, a video went viral showing Virginia Tech Football fans going wild as Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" blasted in the jam-packed stadium.

The sight of young college students having fun outdoors triggered Chapman.

It turns out, however, that Chapman didn't exactly always practice the safest of COVID protocols. Chapman had repeatedly shared pictures that summer of him and his daughters cheering on the Phoenix Suns without masks.

77,"Fentanyl overdoses become No. 1 cause of death among US adults, ages 18-45: 'A national emergency'",Audrey Conklin,"

Fentanyl overdoses have surged to the leading cause of death for adults between the ages of 18 and 45, according to an analysis of U.S. government data.

Between 2020 and 2021, nearly 79,000 people between 18 and 45 years old — 37,208 in 2020 and 41,587 in 2021 — died of fentanyl overdoses, the data analysis from opioid awareness organization Families Against Fentanyl shows.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be deadly even in very small amounts, and other drugs, including heroin, meth and marijuana, can be laced with the dangerous drug. Mexico and China are the primary sources for the flow of fentanyl into the United States, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

Comparatively, between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 15, 2021, there were more than 53,000 COVID-19 deaths among those between the ages of 18 and 49, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""This is a national emergency. America’s young adults — thousands of unsuspecting Americans — are being poisoned,"" James Rauh, founder of Families Against Fentanyl, said in a statement. ""It is widely known that illicit fentanyl is driving the massive spike in drug-related deaths. A new approach to this catastrophe is needed.""

TEXAS SEIZED ENOUGH FENTANYL TO KILL 200 MILLION PEOPLE THIS YEAR ALONE, OFFICIALS SAY

Rauh, who lost his son to an overdose, added that ""declaring illicit fentanyl a Weapon of Mass Destruction would activate additional and necessary federal resources to root out the international manufacturers and traffickers of illicit fentanyl and save American lives.""

The DEA on Thursday announced a surge in the sale of fake prescription pills containing deadly opioids on social media platforms like Snapchat.

Experts believe there is a correlation between the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent increase in fentanyl overdoses.

WHAT IS NARCAN? THE LIFESAVING TREATMENT THAT CAN REVERSE OPIOID OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS

More adults between 18 and 45 died of fentanyl overdoses in 2020 than any other leading cause of death, including COVID-19, motor vehicle accidents, cancer and suicide. Fentanyl also killed more Americans in general in 2020 than car accidents, gun violence, breast cancer and suicide, according to the analysis of CDC data from Families Against Fentanyl.

Fentanyl deaths doubled from 32,754 fatalities to 64,178 fatalities in two years between April 2019 and April 2021.

In the first five months of 2021 alone, more than 42,600 fentanyl overdose deaths were reported, which represents an increase of more than 1,000 fentanyl deaths per month compared to the same time period in 2020.

ARKANSAS WOMAN SPEAKS OUT ON ‘AMERICA’S NEWSROOM' ON OPIOID CRISIS AFTER LOSING BROTHER TO ADDICTION

""Fentanyl has been found in all the drug supply. That's why anyone using drugs, not just opioids, should carry naloxone,"" Dr. Roneet Lev, emergency physician and former chief medical officer of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), said in a statement. ""The only safe place to obtain drugs is the pharmacy.""

Overall drug overdose deaths are expected to surpass 100,000 in 2021, according to preliminary CDC data, representing a 28% increase between April 2020 and April 2021.

President Biden on Wednesday issued an executive order authorizing sanctions against any foreigner engaged in illicit drug trafficking or production.

""I find that international drug trafficking — including the illicit production, global sale and widespread distribution of illegal drugs, the rise of extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, as well as the growing role of internet-based drug sales — constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States,"" Biden's order states.

Fentanyl drug seizures at the border have reached record highs in 2021, according to data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), as the Biden administration faces a continuing crisis at the southern border.

Border authorities have seized more than 11,000 pounds of fentanyl so far in fiscal year 2021, with less than one month to go, dwarfing the 4,776 pounds seized in fiscal 2020. CBP seizures of other drugs, including marijuana, cocaine and heroin have generally decreased since 2018.

Experts recommend people who use any kind of drug carry Narcan, a lifesaving medicine also known as naloxone, which has the ability to reverse symptoms of an overdose and potentially save lives, according to Family First Intervention .

78,Tessa Majors murder: Admitted NYC teen killer Rashaun Waver sentenced to 14 years to life in prison,Stephanie Pagones,"

The teenager who pleaded guilty to murdering 18-year-old Barnard College student Tessa Majors in New York City ’s Morningside Park in 2019 was sentenced Wednesday to 14 years to life in prison.

Rashaun Weaver received the sentence for fatally stabbing the 18-year-old Virginia transplant on Dec. 11, when he was 14. At the time, Weaver and two others had ventured into the Manhattan park with the plan of robbing people, according to court papers released at the time.

""I want to apologize to the court and government, and your honor,"" Weaver told the court before his sentence was handed down, according to WNBC-TV. He wore a black tie and a dark-red colored shirt.

""Mostly I want to apologize to Tessa’s family,"" he reportedly went on. ""She deserved to have a long life.""

TESSA MAJORS MURDER: TEEN WHO STABBED BARNARD COLLEGE STUDENT TO DEATH PLEADS GUILTY

Weaver's family was in the courtroom during the sentencing and shouted that they loved him.

Majors' parents in the courtroom on Thursday, as one or both of them has been for several past hearings related to his daughter's case. Before the judge imposed his sentence, a victim impact statement from Major's family was read aloud, and stated: ""Tess Majors cannot say how being murdered impacted her because she is dead.""

""The family of Tess Majors doesn't know what Tess would say at this moment about being murdered by Rashaun Weaver,"" the statement continues. ""They know she was against murder and violence in general and that she never harmed another human being in her eighteen years on the planet.""

The statement went on: ""They have no idea what it is like to experience what she experienced. No idea what it is to fight with three males – all of them larger than she – for over a minute, escaping two times only to be surrounded and targeted again … How could they or anyone else know what she felt? The only person who knows what it's like to be murdered early on the evening of December 11th 2019 by Rashaun Weaver and two cohorts is Tess Majors. And she isn't here.""

The victim impact statement further described how the family misses Majors ""every second of every day and will continue to do so.""

The teen's attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, told Fox News Digital the court was holding Weaver accountable for his crimes committed as a ""14-year-old boy.""

""[B]ut the court, the prosecutors office and society are ignoring the incredibly difficult childhood he had,"" Lichtman wrote in statement, ""as well as the cycle of incarceration and violence he grew up in. This was not a surprise considering his circumstances.""

Weaver was allegedly the first to attack the young woman after spotting her inside the park. After she passed the trio in the dimly-lit park while staring down at her iPhone, Weaver ran up behind her and kicked her hard in the back, court papers allege.

TESSA MAJORS SUSPECT PLEADS GUILTY IN KILLING OF BARNARD COLLEGE STUDENT

A scuffle ensued and Majors fought back, biting and clawing at Weaver as she yelled for help.

Weaver’s friend, then-14-year-old Luchiano Lewis, held her in a headlock, while Weaver repeatedly plunged a knife into her chest, piercing her heart and sending the feathers of her down coat flying into the air. The boys were also with Zyairr Davis, who was 13 at the time.

The boys fled with her iPhone, as Majors collapsed to the ground after stumbling up a set of stairs and died.

Weaver wasn’t arrested for Majors’ murder until the evening of Feb. 14 — two months after the slaying.

TESSA MAJORS' SUSPECTED KILLER, 14, JUMPS FROM CAR, SPARKING MANHUNT

He was charged in three separate cases and copped to the top count in each. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for Majors' killing.

He also pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree robbery for a crime committed four days before the stabbing death of Majors. He and Lewis allegedly robbed a stranger, at knifepoint, of his iPhone XR in Morningside Park.

79,Texas Democrat shares new photos of migrant kids being held at the southern border,Bradford Betz,"

A Democratic congressman has shared new photos of the overcrowded conditions at border facilities, where officials have been overwhelmed by a surge of migrants in recent months.

The photos, shared by Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas with CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" show dozens of kids packed into glass-walled rooms, lying should-to-shoulder with foil blankets at a facility in Donna, Texas.

Cuellar, whose district lies in south Texas, sharing a border with Mexico, said many of the migrant kids have been held ""for longer"" than the legal 72-hour limit.

Under federal law, children arriving at the border without parents should be transferred within three days from U.S. Border Patrol custody to long-term facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services until they can be released to family members or sponsors.

BORDER CRISIS CAN BE 'FIXED' IN A WEEK IF BIDEN RETURNS TO TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES: SEN. KENNEDY

Cuellar said it has been nearly impossible to reduce the numbers at detention facilities and that border patrol officials are building new shelters to accommodate the numbers.

""The cities, the counties, the NGOs, we’re feeling the brunt of what’s happening with the family units,"" Cuellar said.

More than 16,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody as of Thursday, including about 5,000 in substandard Customs and Border Protection facilities.

The Biden administration has faced criticism for not allowing the media to access Border Patrol facilities temporarily holding thousands of migrant children seeking to live in the United States.

BIDEN SPOKESWOMAN CALLS RECORD MIGRANT SURGE A 'CYCLICAL ISSUE,' DENIES IT'S WORSE THAN PRIOR YEARS

Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been calling on the administration to open the facilities to the cameras, asserting that the current policy is designed to keep the public from ""fully realizing"" what is happening at the border.

U.S. authorities reported encounters with more than 100,000 migrants on the southern border in February, the highest since a four-month streak in 2019.

Encounters have averaged about 5,000 people per day throughout March, which would be about a 50% increase over February if those figures hold for the entire month.

An NPR reporter appeared to call Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor liars on Wednesday after they issued a joint statement disputing a recent NPR report as ""false.""

NPR reported the conservative justice refused to wear a mask on the bench despite requests to do so, but Gorsuch and Sotomayor issued a statement calling it a ""false"" story that surprised them. As the joint statement spread across the media industry, NPR reporter David Gura raised eyebrows by declaring the justices’ statement was ""at best false"" while he condemned reporters who passed it along.

DISPUTED NPR REPORT CLAIMED GORSUCH REFUSED TO WEAR MASK DESPITE PLEA FROM SOTOMAYOR: ‘100% FALSE’

""I [sic] surprised at how many Supreme Court correspondents I admire are passing along a statement from two justices that is at best false without any context whatsoever,"" Gura tweeted shortly after Gorsuch and Sotomayor issued their statement.

""Reporting that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask surprised us. It is false. While we may sometimes disagree about the law, we are warm colleagues and friends,"" Gorsuch and Sotomayor said about NPR’s report.

NPR’s story by legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, ""Gorsuch didn't mask despite Sotomayor's COVID worries, leading her to telework,"" reported Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the justices to wear masks because of the omicron surge since Sotomayor has diabetes.

TUCKER CARLSON REVEALS HE'S A FAN OF WOKE NPR: 'IT'S HILARIOUS'

Some defenders of NPR, a left-leaning outfit and longtime favorite of elite journalists, suggested the joint statement didn't directly respond to the allegations in the story.

Totenberg couched her language, writing, ""Roberts, understanding that, in some form asked the other justices to mask up,"" suggesting he did it at Sotomayor's behest. Totenberg cited ""court sources"" to report Sotomayor expressed she ""did not feel safe in close proximity to people who were unmasked"" before Roberts made the decision.

""They all did. Except Gorsuch, who, as it happens, sits next to Sotomayor on the bench. His continued refusal since then has also meant that Sotomayor has not attended the justices' weekly conference in person, joining instead by telephone,"" Totenberg wrote. ""Gorsuch, from the beginning of his tenure, has proved a prickly justice, not exactly beloved even by his conservative soulmates on the court.""

Many were stunned at the feedback from Gura, who previously worked at MSNBC.

On Wednesday afternoon, a statement from Roberts further disputed the report. He told Fox News, ""I did not request Justice Gorsuch or any other Justice to wear a mask on the bench."" The chief justice indicated he would have no further comment.

81,"Rapper, 16, accused of shooting NYPD cop could make bail from record label deal",Rebecca Rosenberg,"

EXCLUSIVE: A rising 16-year-old rapper charged with shooting a New York City police officer could be freed on a $250,000 bond as soon as Friday using cash from a record label deal, sources told Fox News Digital.

Camrin Williams – known as C Blue – signed with Interscope records recently and used part of his advance of several hundred thousand dollars to hire celebrity bondsman Ira Judelson to arrange his bond, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Williams' family paid more than $15,000 to Judelson to submit all the bail paperwork to the Bronx district attorney's office.

But before he can be released, prosecutors have up to 72 hours to examine the source of the funds to ensure that none of the money came from illegal activity related to his alleged gang ties.

Judelson, a high-profile bondsman, who has worked with countless celebrities – including disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein and late rapper DMX, declined to comment.

Interscope records didn't immediately return a request for comment.

The up-and-coming musician, whose music videos have garnered over 1 million views on YouTube, was arraigned on one count each of second degree assault and firearm possession and three counts of weapons possession in Bronx Criminal Court Thursday night.

He allegedly shot NYPD officer Kaseem Pennant in the leg Tuesday in Belmont by accident, according to a criminal complaint.

His loaded 9mm pistol discharged while tussling with cops after he tried to flee, the complaint says.

The bullet struck Williams in the groin before exiting his thigh and hitting Pennant, according to his lawyer, Dawn Florio, who blamed cops for the mishap.

NEW YORK CITY 11-MONTH-OLD SHOT IN FACE, POLICE SAY

""My client is in pain, he has open wounds,"" she said. ""They started searching him for no reason and when he tried to walk away, they jumped on top of him. Because of the police officer’s actions, my client got shot and so did the police officer.""

The complaint does not say why cops tried to search Williams who was standing on a sidewalk. Pennant is one of three officers to be shot in New York City so far this year.

Judge Denis Boyle, who has come under fire in the past for his low bails, ordered Williams held on $200,000 cash over $250,000 bond over the objection of prosecutors who requested that he be held without bail.

THIRD NYC OFFICER SHOT THIS YEAR IN STATEN ISLAND DRUG RAID

Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch blasted Boyle's decision as 'horrendous judgement"" that is putting cops and the community in danger. ""There is absolutely no justification and no excuse for setting bail in this case,"" he wrote on Twitter Thursday. ""This individual was previously arrested for carrying an illegal gun. Then he violated his probation, carried another gun and shot a cop. If he gets another opportunity to go free, he will use it to cause more violence and mayhem.""

Both Williams and the officer were treated for minor injuries and released.

""We are extremely fortunate that our @NYPD48Pct brother was able to leave the hospital the same night he was shot while keeping New Yorkers safe. Praying for a speedy recovery,"" the police association wrote Tuesday in a tweet, along with a video of the officer leaving the hospital.

Mayor Eric Adams praised the officers during a Tuesday night press conference.

""I want to commend our NYPD officers for taking an illegal gun and a violent criminal off the streets in the Bronx tonight,"" he said. ""Our officer is alive and will make a recovery. We’re grateful. But we’re also frustrated that this shooter and weapon were on the streets in the first place.""

The suspect was on probation at the time of the shooting for possessing an unloaded gun on a set when he was 14, sources told Fox News Digital.

The Bronx native has been featured in the music videos of rapper Kay Flock, who is charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting dead a 24-year-old Manhattan man.

In an interview with Fusion TV posted to YouTube, Williams talked about his upbringing in the Bronx.

Comedian and actress Kathy Griffin claimed CNN president Jeff Zucker slashed her pay after she had asked for a raise as co-host of the network's New Year's Eve special.

In a profile published Wednesday in The New York Times, Griffin recalled reaching out to Zucker 10 days before the broadcast in 2016 and told him she felt she deserved more than her $80,000 contract since ""she was carrying more of the prep work"" than her co-host, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.

According to Griffin, Zucker ""got very offended.""

Griffin then said to Zucker, ""I would really feel a lot more comfortable showing up if I got paid what I deserve,"" which Zucker perceived as a threat to bail on the show. He then fired her through a call to Griffin's lawyer.

According to the Times, ""Griffin called Zucker again, begging him to take her back. Zucker rehired her, but she said he cut her pay by 20 percent.""

Zucker told the Times he had long supported Griffin's career, dating back to his tenure as the boss of NBCUniversal where he gave the greenlight to Griffin's program ""My Life on the D-List,"" which ran for six seasons on Bravo.

SOCIAL MEDIA LIGHTS UP CNN FOR HIRING ‘ENDLESS SOURCE OF MISINFORMATION' REX CHAPMAN FOR STREAMING SERVICE

The CNN boss called Griffin's demand for a raise just days before New Year's Eve ""completely out of line.""

""It sounds like she is acknowledging that, insofar as Kathy Griffin acknowledges she has ever done anything wrong,"" Zucker told the Times.

CNN did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Griffin, who began co-hosting CNN's New Year's Eve special in 2009, was later terminated by the network following her infamous 2017 photoshoot where she posed with a prop depicting then-President Trump's severed head.

""Which I know sounds funny, but maybe it wasn't so funny for the other ladies who worked at The Atlantic [sic] that had to see that.""

A Bible museum in Germany set up an exhibit claiming that there are LGBTQ themes in biblical studies, and hosted a play that presents a transgender Jesus Christ as a male who identifies as female. The Bibelhaus in Frankfurt has the exhibit running until Dec. 19, and the play took place on Dec. 15, according to the museum website.

The exhibit, ""G*tt w/m/d,"" encourages visitors to ""take a look at the diversity of gender identities from biblical and modern times and find a divine answer that fits all questions: You are good as you are.""

The Bibelhaus website presents three of the exhibits: a statue of the goddess Asherah, an image of ""The New Adam"" with an LGBTQ pride rainbow flag, and a statue of Conchita Wurst, the drag queen persona of Austrian singer Thomas Neuwirth.

CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS RIP PSYCHOLOGY STUDY CLAIMING THAT LGBTQ ACTIVISM POSES NO THREAT TO CHRISTIANS

""Even in biblical times 3000 years ago it was clear: The fertility of the soil, animals and people depends on the gods,"" the exhibit's blurb on Asherah reads. ""A deity can do both - beget and give birth."" The museum notes that Asherah ""in Judea and Samaria still belonged firmly in many households.""

""Created in God's image, Adam is the blueprint for each of us,"" the museum website explains. ""What does that reveal about people in themselves, about God and much more importantly: about ourselves? The alchemists of the Middle Ages found a beguiling answer: God's image is both male and female, in the origin, when it all began, and finally in the future. In the new creation of God then no longer applies to male or female, but all are one.""

In addition to this exhibit, which opened on Jun. 23, the Bibelhaus hosted the play ""The Gospel According to Jesus, Queen of Heaven,"" written by the English transgender author Jo Clifford. On Dec. 15, the play was performed in German for the first time.

First performed in Glasgow in 2009, the queen of heaven play involves ""Biblical stories"" being ""reimagined by a transgender Jesus.""

Clifford, who identifies as a trans woman, explained the origin of the play in a 2019 interview.

""I had been brought up as a Christian and taught that when you’re unsure of what to do, you should try to think, ‘What would Jesus do?’ I thought, ‘Well, what would Jesus do if Jesus came back to earth now and was me, a trans woman? What would she do and what would she say?’ That was the origin of the play,"" Clifford said.

Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, slammed the exhibit and the play in a statement to Fox News on Wednesday.

""The idea that there is a LGBTQ theme in the Bible is a lie,"" Graham, son of the late global evangelist Billy Graham, said. ""When homosexuality is mentioned in the Bible, it is sin—rebellion against God and associated with His judgment.""

""Any suggestion that Jesus Christ is transgender is not only false, it’s just sick,"" Graham added. ""This is simply man trying to bring God down to his own level.""

""Fortunately, we don’t have to wonder who Jesus Christ is because God tells us Himself in the Bible,"" the evangelist added. ""When God sent His Son on a rescue mission to earth to save us from our sins, He chose to come to us as a man, Jesus Christ.""

""From the time of Christ’s birth on that first Christmas morning, to His sacrificial death on the cross, to His resurrection from the tomb, the Bible only refers to Jesus Christ as a male,"" Graham said. ""The Bible has many names for Jesus, including Son of God, Son of Man, Prince of Peace, King of Kings, and the bridegroom of the Church.""

""The Bible doesn’t leave any confusion or uncertainty over how God has revealed Himself to us,"" the evangelist concluded. ""This is why any effort to describe Jesus Christ as transgender must be condemned as a profane perversion of the Scriptures.""",https://www.foxnews.com

Green Bay Packers star Aaron Rodgers finally reacted to President Biden last week, after the commander in chief in December made an offhand comment to a Packers fan that the quarterback should get vaccinated.

""When the President of the United States says, 'This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,' it's because him and his constituents, – which I don't know how there are any if you watch any of his attempts at public speaking -- but I guess he got 81 million votes,"" Rodgers told ESPN in an interview published Friday.

He also called the Biden administration a ""fake White House"" and questioned if the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could be trusted.

While touring tornado damage in Kentucky last December, Biden was caught on camera joking with a woman wearing a Packers jacket.

""Tell that quarterback he's gotta get the vaccine,"" Biden said.

BEARS LEGEND DICK BUTKUS TAKES SHOT AT PACKERS' AARON RODGERS AFTER GETTING VERIFIED ON TWITTER

Rodgers – whose Packers were eliminated from the NFL postseason by the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night, despite being the NFC's top-seeded team – first sparked criticism last fall when he said he had been ""immunized"" and later clarified that he hadn't been vaccinated.

He has defended using the term ""immunized"" and told ESPN that players being asked about their vaccination status has amounted to a ""witch hunt.""

""I had a plan going in for that question to be asked,"" Rodgers told ESPN , recalling his strategy going into his media availability. ""It was a pseudo witch hunt going on -- who was vaccinated, who wasn't vaccinated. I was in a multi-month conversation that turned into an appeal process with the NFL at that time, and my appeal hinged on that exact statement [immunized]. So what I said was, number one, factually true. I went through a multi-immunization process. And at the end of that, I don't know what you would call it, I would call it immunized.""

One national security expert said that President Biden gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""green light"" to enter Ukraine.

Amid increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.K. 's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said on Saturday that it has information suggesting that the Russian government is plotting to install a pro-Kremlin leader in Kyiv.

""We have information that indicates the Russian Government is looking to install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine,"" a spokesperson for the British agency said.

""When President Biden last week seemed to give him even a bigger green light and a signal, well, I think Vladimir Putin can do anything right now. He could invade. He could have a hybrid war, but he will get his objective one way or the other, either today or within the next year,"" McFarland said.

McFarland claimed the fact that the United States is evacuating the families of embassy personnel in Ukraine is a sign that ""we think things are going to get really bad and we don't want Americans anywhere near it.""

The national security expert said that the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal ""contributed"" to what's now taking place between Ukraine and Russia because it gave other countries the perception that the United States is ""chaotic"" and ""won't stand up to its adversaries.""

""Whatever happened in Afghanistan had a ripple effect with Ukraine. Whatever is going to happen with Ukraine is going to have a ripple effect with China, but it will have a ripple effect with Iran.

Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane (Ret.) said that President Biden is making a ""strategic mistake"" by not taking any preemptive actions.

""He made a strategic mistake. By not taking any preemptive actions. To be curbed from conducting military operations in Ukraine. And by that, I mean economic sanctions for deploying troops to Ukraine, border moving naval forces into NATO countries, particularly Poland and Romania,"" Keane said.

However, Keane doesn't think Russia will attempt any kind of military operation with the Olympics going on in China beginning in February.

Advisors presented Biden with various options to respond to Russia's aggressive stance in Eastern Europe in a Sunday briefing at Camp David. The president is considering sending 3,000-5,000 U.S. troops to Romania and to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia as part of a broader NATO effort.

89,China boasts after news report it executed CIA informants,Christopher Wallace,"

China reacted to the revelation it had purged a network of CIA informants with a victory lap, boasting that the execution of a dozen spies within the last seven years was a triumph for its “anti-espionage activities.”

The network was terminated between 2010 and 2012, The New York Times reported Saturday, with 12 or more people killed and several more imprisoned. Without providing confirmation, the Global Times newspaper, which is published by the official People’s Daily, said in an editorial smashing the ring with extreme prejudice was a “sweeping victory.”

“If this article is telling the truth, we would like to applaud China’s anti-espionage activities,” read the editorial. “Not only was the CIA’s spy network dismantled, but Washington had no idea what happened and which part of the spy network had gone wrong.

THE LATEST: SECURITY COUNCIL CONDEMNS NKOREA MISSILE TEST

“It can be taken as a sweeping victory. Perhaps it means even if the CIA makes efforts to rebuild its spy network in China, it could face the same result.”

If true, the action would be one of the worst security breaches in the U.S. intelligence services in decades. The Times reported that the saga still unnerves the CIA, and although investigators questioned a Chinese-American who left the CIA just before the crackdown began he was allowed to return home to Asia and no charges relating to turning on fellow agents have ever been filed.

While the CIA has undoubtedly carried out its own assessment of what happened, the Times article prompted former insiders to speculate about what caused the demise of the spy network.

“This would indicate an internal, insider threat type of person who was spying for the Chinese,” former CIA Deputy General Counsel for Operations Robert Eatinger told Fox News. Eatinger was Acting General Counsel of the CIA from 2009 to 2014 and now runs his own law firm, SpyLaw Consulting.

Former CIA clandestine officer Mike Baker agreed.

“When you start losing a number of assets, especially when they are all compartmentalized away from each other, you have to assume that one possible explanation is you’ve got a counterintelligence problem, that there is someone with knowledge on the inside - a mole…a traitor,” Baker said.

Asked whether the incident represents an ongoing vulnerability to Chinese infiltration of the CIA, Eatinger pointed out “if somebody is very smart and cautious they can get away with this for a very long time.”

The CIA declined to comment on the disappearing CIA informants in China.

Eatinger agreed with the Chinese editorial, saying the incident “certainly” has a chilling effect on U.S. efforts to spy on Beijing.

“It’s tougher to get new people to talk to you, and the ones you have may stop talking and go away, particularly if you can’t protect their identity,"" he said.

The fact that the story took several years to get into the media could be attributable to CIA employees retiring and finally being able to discuss it publicly, Eatinger added.

Baker said “there is no good reason” to be talking about this now, “unless, and this is speculation, it’s to let the Chinese know that we're on to something to create movement on the other side.” Such a strategy could be acceptable tradecraft.

But Baker worried that it’s also possible that CIA sources revealed the story to reporters because of a cultural problem within the intel community. Segments of the community have been battling with the Trump administration, through a series of leaks.

NORTH KOREA THREAT: EXPERTS PAINT DARK PICTURE OF WHAT FALLOUT OF PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE MAY LOOK LIKE

“Even if what people believe that what they are leaking is OK because it’s simply political and about Trump, there is an overall impact on the culture…it lowers the bar…it starts to normalize the idea of leaking or talking about other, more sensitive things,” he said.

The revelations come amid several incidents of attempted Chinese recruitment of Americans to spy on Beijing’s behalf, including a 28-year-old applicant to the CIA who had studied in China during his college years. Glenn Duffie Shriver was imprisoned for attempting to sell national defense secrets to Chinese agents for about $70,000.

After he was convicted and imprisoned, Shriver starred in FBI videos warning American students of the dangers of Chinese recruitment.

""If someone is offering you money and it feels like you don't have to do anything for that money, then there’s probably a hook in there that you're not seeing,” Shriver said in one FBI video.

The Shriver case reportedly led the CIA to think twice about recruiting Americans who studied in China, which in turn made it harder to recruit qualified CIA officers.

“There’s a far greater scrutiny of anyone who has spent time in China as a student, particularly on the longer-term programs,” former CIA deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific Dennis Wilder told Newsweek.

Meanwhile, a veteran State Department employee was charged in March with making false statements to the FBI about gifts she received from Chinese spies, including an iPhone, a laptop and international travel.

Intelligence gathering “is a high risk world,” Baker told Fox News. “That’s why it’s such an emotional issue for the agency. People die. It’s very serious. It’s never helpful if people can’t keep their mouths shut.”",https://www.foxnews.com
90,Chicago reinstates gun and ammunition tax after court deems it unconstitutional,Adam Sabes,"

The Cook County Board of Commissioners reinstated its firearm and ammunition tax after it was struck down by the Illinois Supreme Court in October.

During Thursday's board of commissioners meeting, members voted to approve an amendment to a previous ordinance dealing with how firearms and ammunition are taxed in order to comply with an Oct. 21 Illinois Supreme Court ruling.

LIBERAL INFLUENCERS SEIZE ON LATEST SCHOOL SHOOTING TO PUSH GUN CONTROL

The Oct. 21 opinion struck down the tax because it impeded on citizen's Second Amendment rights. However, Illinois Supreme Court Justice Mary Jane Theis said in the court's opinion that any tax on fundamental rights must ""establish that the tax classification is substantially related to the object of the legislation.""

The new amendment passed by the board of commissioners directs revenue raised from the tax to a new ""Special Purpose Equity Fund to fund gun violence prevention programs."" Revenue from the tax will also go to ""operations and programs aimed at reducing gun violence.""

Previously, the revenue went toward a ""Public Safety Fund to fund operations related to public safety.""

Under the ordinance, retail purchases are subject to a $25 tax for each firearm purchased. Centerfire ammunition is taxed at $0.05 per cartridge, and rimfire ammunition is taxed at $0.01 per cartridge.

The board voted to tax firearms in 2012 and amended the tax in 2015 to include ammunition.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle believes the revisions made to the ordinance will align it with the court's opinion.

91,"Russia preparing false-flag operation as pretext for Ukraine invasion, US warns",Brooke Singman,"

The United States is concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion into Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes, a U.S. official said Friday.

The official told Fox News that Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine.

OPINION: PUTIN IS PICKING A FIGHT HE CAN'T WIN WITH UKRAINE

The official said that the Russian military plans to begin these activities several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February. The official said the plans are reminiscent of the Kremlin's playbook in 2014 with the invasion of Crimea.

The Biden administration, according to the official, has information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a ""false-flag operation"" in eastern Ukraine. The official warned that the operatives are trained in urban warfare, and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces.

The official explained that the administration's information also indicates that Russian influence actors are already beginning to fabricate Ukrainian provocations in state and social media to justify a Russian intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine.

One example, the official said, is Russian officials and influence actors emphasizing narratives about ""the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and the increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders.""

NATO, RUSSIA SUMMIT WRAPS UP: ‘NOT AN EASY DISCUSSION,’ SAYS NATO CHIEF

""These media narratives also blame the West for escalating tension, highlight humanitarian issues in Ukraine that Russian intervention could solve, and promote Russian patriotism to encourage domestic support for military action,"" the official said.

Last month, the official said that Russian language content on social media covering ""all three of these narratives"" increased to an average of nearly 3,500 posts per day – a 200% increase from the daily average in November.

This, after the Biden administration this week maintained that it is ""working in lockstep"" with its allies to ""urge de-escalation and respond to the security crisis caused by Russia.""

92,San Francisco DA Chesa Boudin sued for turning back on Asian attack victim as anti-AAPI hate crimes soar 567%,Stephanie Pagones,"

An Asian-American man who was violently attacked in 2019 is suing San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, accusing the prosecutor of mishandling the case against his assailants – who beat him with a bat, threatened him with a glass bottle and told him: ""I’m going to kill you,"" court papers show.

Anh Lê’s lawsuit against Boudin was filed just one day before the San Francisco Police Department announced an astonishing 567% increase in hate crimes against Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) individuals.

""I am a survivor of a horrendous attack that took place in San Francisco with no consequences to the attackers."" — Anh Lê, 69-year-old crime victim

The now-69-year-old victim slammed the liberal district attorney for refusing ""to uphold the fundamental rights of Asian American victims of racially-motivated violence,"" and in turn failing to ""recognize their humanity,"" the lawsuit states.

""In this case, as disturbing as the attack on Mr. Lê is, equally disturbing is his mistreatment by the DA’s office in the aftermath of his violent attack by the Tanner family,"" the complaint charges, referring to the suspect in the case. The 111-page suit was filed Monday in the Northern District of California.

SACRAMENTO DA SLAMS FAR-LEFT PROSECUTORS AFTER BRIANNA KUPFER MURDER: ‘THEY WANT TO DISMANTLE THE SYSTEM’

""I am a survivor of a horrendous attack that took place in San Francisco with no consequences to the attackers,"" Lê said during a news conference announcing the suit. He said suspect Jimmy Tanner, whom he described as being 250 pounds, was arrested for felony terroristic threat, felony elder abuse and battery – but ultimately got off with a misdemeanor.

He added: ""Justice has not been served.""

Lê was walking in San Francisco’s Chinatown on the afternoon of Nov. 2, 2019, when he saw a teenager riding his bicycle ""very quickly on a crowded sidewalk"" and headed toward him and other pedestrians, court papers state.

""You have to be careful, there’s people all over,"" Lê allegedly told the youth. The teen’s father, Jimmy Tanner, was nearby, according to the suit.

Devolved into violence

But what started with an allegedly polite request devolved into violence.

OAKLAND ELDERLY WOMAN SHOVED TO THE GROUND IN SHOCKING VIDEO

""Without provocation, Tanner attacked Mr. Lê on a crowded sidewalk, threatened him with glass bottle, and told him, ""I’m going to kill you!"" the lawsuit states. ""While Tanner was attacking Mr. Lê, Tanner’s son struck Mr. Lê repeatedly with a baseball bat.""

The father and son then allegedly followed Lê for half a block before he could cross the street and call 911.

The public defender representing Tanner said later Wednesday that the bat used by the son was plastic.

""Out of fear for his safety, Mr. Tanner’s 11-year-old son took out his plastic baseball bat and swung it at Mr. Lê,"" the attorney, Sliman Nawabi, told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""Mr. Le refused medical attention that day and had no visible injuries from the plastic baseball bat. Mr. Le was never attacked by Mr. Tanner nor was a glass bottle used as a weapon against Mr. Le.""

Nawabi also described his client as a ""severely disabled man.""

Lê, who is Vietnamese-American, said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack.

Lê later learned that Tanner and his son were linked to two more incidents in Chinatown that day, when they ""terrorized Americans of Asian descent,"" according to the complaint.

A spokesperson for the San Francisco police did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request seeing information pertaining to the allegations.

‘Slap on the wrist’

Boudin’s office then ignored Lê’s requests for help, failed to tell him about plea-bargaining discussions, told him he was not allowed to attend hearings related to the case against the Tanners, and never gave him the chance to read his victim impact statement – despite the existence of Marsy’s Law, which says that victims of crimes are allotted certain rights, the lawsuit alleges.

The DA’s office then gave Tanner ""a slap on the wrist"" plea deal that involved one year of probation but no jail time. Boudin’s office notified Lê ""after the fact via a cursory email,"" the suit states.

Neither Tanner nor his son was charged with a hate crime, the lawsuit states.

""Of course, not every violence crime against a member of Asian American community is a hate crime,"" the complaint continues, ""but here the Tanners’ violent unprovoked attacks on multiple groups of Asian Americans in Chinatown on the same day were evidently racially motivated.""

SAN FRANCISCO NURSE WHO 'ABRUPTLY' LEFT JOB MID-SHIFT HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE

Rachel Marshall, director of communications for Boudin's office, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that Boudin ""has been a steadfast advocate for improved victim services and support for the AAPI community.""

""DA Boudin has presided over an historic expansion of Victim Services; has implemented new policies to improve language access to the courts; and has promoted Kasie Lee — who has a lengthy track record of advocacy in the AAPI community — to Chief of Victim Services,"" she said in a statement, in part. ""DA Boudin has consistently sought additional funding to support victims. We will not stop fighting to ensure that every victim’s needs are met.""

Marshall noted that the charging decision was made under former District Attorney Suzy Loftus. Marshall said police did not recommend hate crime charges in the case.

‘Pushed aside’

To make matters worse, the lawsuit claims, Boudin’s office allegedly refused for months to correct entry errors in the protective order barring Tanner from going near Lê and his other victims – failing to correctly state Lê’s full name and providing the wrong age for him.

""Unfortunately, Mr. Lê was ignored, pushed aside, and shuffled around like one of the DA’s office’s many files,"" the lawsuit continues. ""Instead of treating Mr. Lê as an individual and a citizen who had suffered a brutally racially-motivated attack, the DA’s office made Mr. Lê feel invisible.""

""Mr. Lê was ignored, pushed aside, and shuffled around like one of the DA’s office’s many files."" — Lawsuit against San Francisco DA

Boudin’s Twitter profile boasts the phrase ""people powered"" and is riddled with tweets in support of the AAPI community and victims of targeted attacks against Asian American individuals.

SAN FRANCISCANS SPEAK OUT ON CRIME IN THE CITY: 'IT'S TERRIBLE. IT'S BRUTAL'

""Together with other Bay Area prosecutors, we stand in support of the AAPI community and denounce hate and violence,"" he wrote in a tweet from March 2021 – while Lê’s case was still ongoing – featuring a joint statement from himself and other local leaders.

He moderated an ""Anti-AAPI Violence & Hate Crimes"" virtual summit in May 2021, titled: ""Keeping Our AAPI Community Safe.""

And months earlier, in November 2020, he tweeted, ""Stop the hate and racism targeting our AAPI community!""

But Lê’s lawsuit paints a different picture.

""Despite claiming on its website that ‘the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office works to empower survivors of crime,’ in reality, the DA’s office has not only failed to empower or protect Mr. Lê, but actually exacerbated and further compounded the trauma and indignities he suffered at the hands of the Tanners,"" the suit states.

It adds: ""The DA’s office’s empty promises fail to recognize and restore the dignity of Asian American victims of hate crimes.

Request for hate-crime data

Lê is asking for more support services for victims, namely those in the AAPI community who might face language barriers or difficulty with the legal process. He is also seeking the ""release of complete hate crimes statistics and prosecution/sentencing/plea deal information related to these hate crimes"" and more training for those who handle hate crimes cases.

Among other things, he is further asking a judge to require the DA’s office to notify AAPI hate crimes victims that they are entitled to submit a victim impact statement and ""advise victims explicitly in writing when they have a right to appear at a hearing and that the DA’s office confirm with victims the language that will be used to represent their position.""

Just Tuesday, Boudin’s office announced the creation of an ""AAPI Elder Abuse Steering Committee,"" which convened for the first time on Monday.

The San Francisco police announced Tuesday that the number of victims of Anti-Asian hate crimes skyrocketed by 567% from 9 in 2020 to a staggering 60 in 2021.

Police Chief Bill Scott called the preliminary statistic ""alarming,"" but added that the department had made arrests in the majority of the cases.

""We want the message to be loud and clear to everyone,"" Scott said during a news conference Tuesday. ""We won’t tolerate it. We’re going to do something about it if it does happen, and we’re going to do everything we can to prevent it from happening.""

97,"California trans child molester, 26, gets 2 years in juvenile facility thanks to progressive DA Gascon",Audrey Conklin,"

A Los Angeles County judge on Thursday ordered Hannah Tubbs, a transgender California woman, to serve two years in a juvenile facility after she pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl in 2014.

Before doing so, the judge criticized far-left District Attorney George Gascon, whose office declined to prosecute the repeat offender as an adult.

Tubbs, 26, recently pleaded guilty to molesting the girl in a women's bathroom eight years ago when Tubbs was two weeks away from turning 18. At the time of the crime, she identified as male and went by James Tubbs. She did not identify as female until after she was taken into custody, according to prosecutors.

""Tubbs is 26 years old. Unlike George Gascon’s false narrative, she is not a ‘kid,'"" L.A. Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami, assigned to the Complex Child Abuse Unit, told Fox News Digital.

""There was evidence presented at the juvenile proceedings which showed that Tubbs sexually assaulted two young girls in different incidents in the past. The child victims will suffer lifelong trauma. Tubbs also has prior violent convictions and conduct as an adult.""

Prosecutors say Tubbs walked into the bathroom of a Denny’s in 2014 and grabbed the 10-year-old by the throat, locked her in a stall, and put her hand down the girl’s pants. Tubbs stopped when another person walked into the restroom, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Because Tubbs began identifying as female after she was taken into custody, and Gascon refused to try her as an adult, Tubbs was sentenced to two years in a juvenile facility. In L.A. County, juvenile facilities can house both females and males, but in separate areas. Tubbs will be housed with the females.

Two years is the maximum sentence for any juvenile in the new program over the age of 25, according to Deputy District Attorney Shea Sanna.

LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY RIPPED OVER SENTENCING FOR TRANSGENDER WOMAN WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED GIRL

The sentencing sparked criticism of Gascon, who had vowed to ""immediately stop prosecuting children as adults . "" Gascon has cited studies showing brain development isn't complete until a person is 25 and contends juvenile detention can rehabilitate young offenders.

The LA County Sheriff's office offered to house Tubbs in its county jail, but Judge Mario Barrera ultimately ""decided he did not have the authority to issue an order housing Tubbs in county jail or with the sheriff's department,"" Sanna said, adding that the judge's ""hands were tied.""

Barrera reportedly blamed Gascon's policies for not transferring Tubbs to an adult court during the court proceeding on Thursday.

""I want to be clear,"" Barrera during the Thursday sentencing in a Lancaster, California, courtroom, according to the LA Times. ""The filing of a transfer motion is entirely within the discretion of the district attorney.""

Barrera's ""hands were tied,"" Sanna said. In the end, the judge ""decided he did not have the authority to issue an order housing Tubbs in county jail or with the sheriff's department.""

Kathryn Barger, chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, called the outcome of the case ""unsatisfactory"" in a statement Thursday.

""Judge Barrera’s hands were tied today – due to the fact that the DA’s office failed to file a motion to transfer Tubbs to adult criminal court, which is where she rightly belongs,"" Barger said. ""Instead, we’re left with a 26-year-old individual sentenced to two years in a juvenile facility in isolation, separated by sight and sound from the other juveniles. ""

LOS ANGELES DA LAUNCHES CONTROVERSIAL ‘DIVERSION’ PROGRAM FOR YOUTH CRIMINALS

In a Jan. 18 letter to Barger, Gascon described Tubbs' conduct as ""deplorable.""

""I am shocked and outraged that she evaded capture for so long. The harm that she caused is irreparable. Tubbs has been ‘sentenced’ to our county’s secure treatment facility for youth (STFY),"" the location of which ""has yet to be approved,"" Gascon wrote

He added that ""all cases of adults returning to juvenile court will continue to be flagged and reviewed for possible adult jurisdiction resolutions.""

Tubbs was not linked to the case until 2019. Her DNA was entered into a database that year following an arrest on suspicion of battery in Idaho. Prosecutors filed charges against her for the 2014 assault case in 2020, not long after Gascon took office.

Tubbs has previously been arrested for battery, drug possession and probation violations in Idaho and Washington.

She has a pending misdemeanor case in Washington and was also accused of sexually assaulting a minor in Kern County, California, but the case did not get prosecuted, according to the LA Times. Tubbs might also qualify as ""developmentally disabled"" and has multiple mental illnesses, the paper reported.

Gascon told the LA Times he was concerned Tubbs could be victimized in an adult facility as a trans woman and said a probation report recommended she be sentenced to home confinement. Prosecutors asked that Tubbs be kept in custody for two years instead.

""Because of George Gascon's blanket policy against transferring any juvenile to adult court, even if the 17-year-old rapes or murders an innocent child, James Tubbs will not have to register as a sex offender, will not spend any time in county jail or state prison, will be 26 and housed with juveniles for a very short period of time, and will be released with no probation or parole monitoring. The victims will get no justice. The public will get no safety,"" Hatami said.

He added that Gascon ""has sacrificed the safety of the public, the rights of the victim and justice in order to follow his own political ideology.""

""It’s an injustice against all of us, especially the young victims,"" Hatami said.

98,Holocaust Remembrance Day – why we must never forget,David Harris,"

January 27 has been designated by the United Nations as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The date was chosen because, on January 27, 1945, the infamous Nazi German slave labor and death camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was liberated by the Soviet army.

The camp, actually it was a complex of camps and work sites, was the destination for more than 1.3 million people arrested, deported, and enslaved by Hitler’s regime. Beyond imagination, an estimated 1.1 million were murdered there, of whom one million were Jews from across Europe and one hundred thousand were primarily Soviet prisoners of war, Polish Catholics, and Roma.

RISE IN ANTISEMITISM, HOLOCAUST DENIAL HAS EU LEADERS WORRIED

Auschwitz-Birkenau was not the only killing site. Other camps included Belzec, Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthausen, Sobibor, and Treblinka. In all, an estimated six million Jews, or two-thirds of European Jewry, were exterminated by Nazi Germany and its collaborators, whether in camps, forced marches, round-ups, or other killing sites, such as Babi Yar, a ravine in the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine.

The Holocaust defies imagination. Its aim was the Endlösung, or Final Solution, of the Jewish people. In pursuit of this goal, a new alphabet of genocide was created — from A for Auschwitz to Z for Zyklon-b, the nerve gas used in the gas chambers.

Every Jew was a target, including 1.5 million children. The Jews were pursued for one reason— they were Jews and, according to Adolf Hitler’s demented worldview, all Jews had to be eliminated.

Seventy-seven years after the war’s end, why should these events still matter?

First, to forget the past is to dishonor the memory of the victims. Those victims don’t even have the dignity of graves. They only have us, and without us who will remember not only their tragic fate, but also the vibrancy of their lives.

Second, the Holocaust did not emerge from thin air. Rather, it came after centuries of antisemitism — from blood libels to expulsions, from ghettos to inquisitions, from pogroms to forced conversions — on European soil. The longevity, resilience, and lethality of what has been described as the world’s oldest social pathology, antisemitism, should never be underestimated.

IDAHO ANNE FRANK MEMORIAL DEFACED WITH ANTISEMITIC IMAGERY: 'ABHORRENT'

Third, prior to Hitler’s seizure of power in 1933, Germany had experienced 14 years of democracy in a country widely viewed as among the most educated, cultured, and developed. But democracy proved fragile, culture did not stop savagery and education proved no deterrent to brutality. Those sobering lessons mustn’t be forgotten.

And fourth, appeasement of Nazi Germany, tried by Britain and France in the 1930s, proved a failure. Not only did it not stop the German juggernaut, but instead encouraged it to become even more predatory towards Jews and, more generally, other European nations. As the legendary Winston Churchill said, ""An appeaser is someone who feeds the crocodile, believing they will be eaten last.""

In addition to remembrance, what are the other enduring imperatives from this era?

*It is important but insufficient to mourn murdered Jews. Tragically, they cannot be brought back to life. But Jews today, whether in the United States or abroad, face increased Jew-hatred.

According to FBI statistics, nearly 60% of all religiously motivated hate crimes are directed at Jews, 2% of the U.S. population. One cannot pay tribute to the memory of Holocaust victims without standing up against antisemitism, in its multiple forms, today.

*During the Holocaust, there was no Israel. Had there been, how many Jews might have found safe haven when so many countries around the world, including the U.S., shamefully turned their backs on the fate of Jews desperate to escape.

To be sure, Israel is an ancient idea, born nearly 4,000 years ago. Its modern-day urgency was underscored by its absence when Jews needed it most. Fortunately, Israel now is a living reality, and a good percentage of its population are, in fact, Holocaust survivors and their descendants.

*The Holocaust did not begin with Auschwitz. It started with Nazi demonization and dehumanization of an entire people. It was followed by disenfranchisement, and, finally, destruction of that people. In our pluralistic world, where hate is too often a prominent feature, the Holocaust’s slippery slope serves as a permanent reminder and warning of humankind’s capacity for evil.

As the war’s liberators, eyewitnesses, and survivors succumb to age, who, if not us, will carry the enduring lessons of the Holocaust in a world desperately in need of daily reminders?",https://www.foxnews.com
99,"Dutch police uncover 'torture chamber,' makeshift prison; 6 arrested",Frank Miles,"

Six men were arrested after Dutch police discovered sea containers that had been converted into a makeshift prison and sound-proofed “torture chamber” complete with a dentist’s chair, tools, including pliers and scalpels, and handcuffs, a high-ranking officer announced Tuesday.

Authorities said police conducted the raid before the torture chamber could be used and alerted potential victims, who went into hiding.

The grisly discovery was made last month by officers investigating leads generated by data from encrypted phones used by criminals. The communications network was cracked recently by French police.

Detectives in Britain and the Netherlands have already arrested hundreds of suspects based on the encrypted messages.

Tuesday’s announcement gave a chilling insight into the increasingly violent Dutch criminal underworld, which is involved in the large-scale production and trafficking of drugs.

Dutch police said last week that their investigations, code-named 26Lemont, based on millions of messages from the EncroChat phones, had led to the arrest of more than 100 suspects and seizure of more than 17,600 pounds of cocaine and 2,600 pounds of crystal meth as well as the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs and seizure of dozens of firearms.

On June 22, Dutch national police force officers arrested six men on suspicion of crimes, including preparing kidnappings and serious assault.

Detectives also discovered the seven converted sea containers in a warehouse in Wouwse Plantage, a small village in the southwestern Netherlands, close to the border with Belgium, according to a statement released Tuesday.

They were tipped off by messages from an EncroChat phone, including photos of the container and dentist’s chair with belts attached to the arm and foot supports.

The messages called the warehouse the “treatment room” and the “ebi,” a reference to a top security Dutch prison.

The messages also revealed identities of potential victims, who were warned and went into hiding, police said.

Video released by the police showed a heavily armed arrest team blasting open a door at the warehouse and discovering the improvised prison.

Another armed team detained a suspect in Rotterdam.

“Six of the containers were intended as cells in which people could be tied up and one container was intended as a torture chamber,” Andy Kraag, head of the police’s National Investigation Service, said in a video released by police, adding that the police operation “prevented a number of violent crimes.”

A search of the containers uncovered bags containing tools, including hedge cutters, scalpels and pliers.

The tools “were likely intended to torture victims or at least put them under pressure,” the police statement said.

In searches of other properties, including what police described as a base for the criminals near the port city of Rotterdam, officers found police uniforms and body armor, stolen vehicles, 25 firearms and drugs.

A court in Amsterdam ordered the six suspects held for 90 days as investigations continue.

“This is a great result of the 26Lemont investigation,” Kraag said. “And, take it from me, many more results will follow.”

106,"Illinois teens robbed at gunpoint at lemonade stand, local police help replenish lost funds",Talia Kaplan,"

Two Illinois teenagers who were running a lemonade stand were robbed at gunpoint, and local police stepped in to replenish the stolen funds.

Earlier this month Jude Peterson and his friend Tristan Charbonnel, both 13, set up a lemonade stand in Peterson’s Peoria neighborhood when police said two people, one of which had a gun, robbed the stand and the incident was reportedly caught by a neighbor’s surveillance camera.

Charbonnel told “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Sunday that “last week two boys came up with a gun and took all the money.”

“It was really surprising, but there wasn't really time to be scared,” he continued.

Peterson and Charbonnel were not injured and the thieves took off with the cash box, which contained about $30, the Peoria Journal-Star reported.

Peterson’s father Nathan told the news outlet that Peoria police officers who showed up to the scene “were buying $20 lemonades, which was really kind of them.”

“They were super-gentle with the kids and really seemed to care,” he added.

When people in the neighborhood learned of what had happened, they reportedly stopped by the lemonade stand to donate money and items, including candy and potato chips, to sell.

Chief Loren Marion with the Peoria Police Department told “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Sunday that the community policing sergeant with his department “came up with the idea after the incident happened to do a fund-raiser for the kids.”

108,Los Angeles DA George Gascon recall petition approved by county registrar,Brie Stimson,"

The second effort to recall embattled Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon was officially approved by the Los Angeles County Registrar on Thursday.

Gascon has faced criticism from conservatives and victims’ advocates over his liberal justice policies that they say put criminals first and have led to high crime rates.

Now that the petition has been approved, organizers will have to get 566,857 signatures – about 10% of registered voters in the county – by July 6.

Organizers had vowed to retry after an initial recall effort last fall failed to meet the required number of signatures by Oct. 26.

LA COUNTY DA GASCON RIPPED AGAIN FOR LENIENT CRIME POLICIES: ‘NOT ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF VICTIMS OF CRIME’

If the petition gets the required number of signatures Gascon will face a recall election in the county similar to the one Gov. Gavin Newsom had last September. The governor was able to easily fend off several challengers to maintain his office.

""We are sick and tired of living in the pro-criminal paradise Gascon has created,"" Desiree Andrade and Tania Owen, co-chairs of the Recall DA George Gascon campaign, said in a release. ""Gascon turned his back on us, and now his policies are destroying Los Angeles County right before our eyes and needlessly creating more innocent victims.""

They continued, ""This is our chance to put an end to all of it, but it is massive undertaking that will require an all-in approach from the entire community. We need all Angelenos to join us in this effort to restore public safety and end the chaos in our streets. We all deserve to live without fear of criminals running amok, and to have a District Attorney who actually does his job.""

Some of his orders include the elimination of sentence enhancement charges, zero-bail policies and not prosecuting juveniles as adults for many crimes.

Gascon’s recall effort was also spurred on by several smash and grab and follow-home robberies over the last few months and a number of high-profile murders, including 81-year-old Jacqueline Avant who was killed in her Beverly Hills home and Brianna Kupfer, 24, who was brutally murdered while working at a furniture store.

Gascon's policies have also been condemned by prosecutors in the district attorney’s office.

Eric Siddall, a prosecutor who also serves as the vice president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys of Los Angeles County, said Gascon has tied the hands of his prosecutors by not allowing them to properly fight for crime victims.

""It would be like someone said ‘You have a (Apple) MacBook, but I want you to use an abacus to solve this mathematical problem,’"" Siddall told Fox News. ""The district attorney is not always on the side of victims of crime.""

109,DeSantis floats sending migrants to Delaware in response to Biden admin's migrant flights to Florida,Adam Shaw,"

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday floated sending migrants to President Biden’s home state of Delaware, in response to the dozens of migrant flights DeSantis says have landed in Florida at the behest of the Biden administration.

""If they’re going to come here, we’ll provide buses,"" DeSantis said of the migrants on the flights. ""I will send them to Delaware and do that.""

FLORIDA GOV SAYS BIDEN ADMIN HAS LANDED DOZENS OF SECRET FLIGHTS CARRYING ILLEGAL MIGRANTS INTO THE STATE

""If he’s not going to support the border being secure, then he should be able to have everyone there,"" he said.

The Republican governor has been ramping up his battle with the administration over migrant flights into Jacksonville. His office told The Washington Examiner that there have been more than 70 flights of migrants into the Sunshine State since the summer.

The Examiner reported that officials said the Biden administration has refused to tell the governor’s office about who is facilitating the flights and other information. DeSantis told Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that the flights operate in the late hours of the night at ""one or two or three in the morning."" He added that the flights were ""unannounced"" and he was given ""no notice"" and thus no ability to veto the flights.

Republicans have been sounding the alarm for months on flights into the interior of the U.S. and other transports of migrants into non-border states such as Tennessee and New York.

While many single adults and some migrant families are being returned via Title 42 public health protections, the Biden administration is not applying Title 42 to many migrant families, or to unaccompanied children. UACs are being transported to Health and Human Services custody and eventually to sponsors – such as a parent already in the country – wherever that may be.

HONDURAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHARGED WITH MURDER ENTERED US FALSELY CLAIMING TO BE UNACCOMPANIED MINOR: REPORT

But the situation in Florida was highlighted last week when the New York Post reported that a 24-year-old Honduran national who has been charged with the murder of a Florida man reportedly entered the U.S. illegally claiming to be an unaccompanied minor .

The Post reported that Yery Noel Medina Ulloa was arrested in early October in Jacksonville after he was found covered in blood and was charged with the death of Francisco Javier Cuellar, a father of four who had taken him in.

An ICE spokesman confirmed to Fox News that ICE had filed an immigration detainer on Oct. 13 on Ulloa, who it said was an unlawfully present citizen of Honduras, following his arrest in Jacksonville for murder.

DeSantis told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that he is looking at a range of actions to target the companies facilitating the flights into the state.

We can obviously deny them state contracts, which we will do. Can we deny them access to Florida's market generally? Can we tax them? Can we do things to provide disincentives so they can't do it?

LEAKED VIDEO SHOWS FEDERAL CONTRACTORS FLYING MIGRANTS TO SUBURBAN NY: 'BETRAYING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'

Leaked video shows migrants being transported on secret charter flights under the cover of night from southern border states to Westchester, New York.

""The government is betraying the American people,"" a federal contractor told a Westchester County police officer in a conversation recorded on the officer’s body camera on the tarmac of a Westchester airport on Aug. 13, 2021.

The footage was obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino. Reports first surfaced of such flights back in October when the New York Post captured video of the scene at the airport in White Plains, New York .

""Our government is completely out of control right now. They have lied to us. They've lied to the American people,"" Astorino, who is running as a Republican for the governor of New York, said Wednesday on Fox News’ ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

Astorino said he personally saw the migrants being put on a bus to a Costco, where they were ""then released into cars into the community.""

The 51-minute footage of the August incident shows Westchester Police Sgt. Michael Hamborsky peppering federal contractors early in the morning with questions about the after-hours flights and why local police were not provided details.

""You’re on a secure facility here; we really don’t know anything and we’re in charge of security,"" he told one of the contractors.

""This is anti all our security stuff,"" Hamborsky said.

Such flights first streamed into the suburban airport from places such as McAllen, and Houston, Texas, last August, according to the New York Post. They only stopped after the outlet captured footage of the scenes back in October.

Malliotakis said aiding and abetting illegal immigration is a violation of the law.

""And you have it coming from the president of the United States. It is completely unacceptable. The Supreme Court ruled that he had to reinstate Remain in Mexico and he’s clearly not done that,"" Malliotakis said.

""In addition to that, you know that the drug cartels are making billions and billions of dollars every month with human trafficking, drug trafficking. We have the highest rate of fentanyl deaths in this country. Among 18 to 45-year-olds, it is the leading cause of death.

Michigan investigative journalist Charlie LeDuff told Fox News on Thursday that a Lebanese-born Venezuelan national listed on the FBI's terror watchlist was released into the United States after crossing the border illegally.

According to LeDuff's reporting for Deadline Detroit, Issam Bazzi, who was caught near the Rio Grande River in Texas last November, was released on his own recognizance ahead of his March asylum hearing in Detroit. Bazzi reportedly traveled to the U.S. illegally with his wife and daughter, said LeDuff.

Bazzi got ""word that the Biden administration has given asylum to Venezuelans. He, his daughter, and his wife fly to Monterrey, Mexico, hire a smuggler, get rafted over into Brownsville, Texas, wants asylum,"" LeDuff explained on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

""He is not only on the terror watch list. The hit comes back high derogatory information affiliated with an unspecified group. Classified information,"" said LeDuff.

Despite this, Bazzi was reportedly released into the U.S. because his weight deemed him at high risk for COVID, the journalist told Tucker Carlson.

""The important thing here is that we all wondered, who got in? Did terrorists get in? We now know that the government has a known terrorist that they let go. Why? Because he’s a high COVID risk. Why? Because he is overweight. So now in my community we get this guy. Nobody I know in the federal government, probably nobody you know, has ever heard about letting somebody high up on the terror watch list into the interior of this country.

Men may want to limit their cell phone use if they are concerned about fertility, according to a recent metanalysis published this past November in Environmental Research , which found the radiofrequency electromagnetic waves (RF-EMWs) emitted by cell phones decrease sperm quality by reducing their motility, viability, and concentration.

​​""Male cell-phone users should strive to reduce mobile phone use to protect their sperm quality,"" said Yun Hak Kim, lead researcher and an assistant professor at Pusan National University .

Previous research has shown cell phones emit RF-EMWs that can be absorbed by the human body to result in potential adverse side effects on the brain, heart and reproductive function, according to the study .

RESEARCHERS FIND POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION AND URINARY INCONTINENCE WITH CYCLING WORKOUTS

Because there have been numerous published studies since 2012 on the effects of cell phones and sperm quality, the South Korean researchers conducted a comprehensive review that synthesizes these studies to discover common results, also known as a meta-analysis , to evaluate if exposure to RF-EMWs from cell phones affects human sperm quality .

Out of the 435 published studies and records that the researchers screened between 2012 and 2021, they found 18 studies with 4280 sperm samples that were suitable for statistical analyses .

INCREASED DAILY EXERCISE FOR 10 MINUTES COULD PREVENT MORE THAN 100K DEATHS A YEAR: STUDY

The study did not find a link between the time spent on the cell phone and sperm quality, only that exposure to the cell phone itself was associated with reduced numbers, decreased movement, and how long the sperm was alive, the press release said .

Although the study reported the findings were consistent with previous studies on the topic, it had some limitations because of low amounts of data on patients and because the cell phones in the study are now outdated .

""Knowing that the number of cell phone users is most likely going to increase in the future, it’s high time we start considering exposure to RF-EMW as one of the underlying factors causing a reduction in sperm quality among the male population,"" the press release added .

118,Horrifying details released in investigation of 'extremist Muslim' compound that allegedly conducted school-shooting training,Matt Richardson,"

The children discovered at an “extremist Muslim” compound in New Mexico earlier this month were both trained to use firearms and taught multiple tactical techniques in order to kill teachers, law enforcement and other institutions they found corrupt, state prosecutors revealed on Monday.

The prosecutors provided more details about the accusations during a court hearing in which they asked that Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and four other defendants be held pending trial on child abuse charges.

But the judge in the case ruled against prosecutors’ request.

Judge Sarah Backus said although she was concerned by ""troubling facts,"" prosecutors failed to articulate any specific threats to the community.

She set a $20,000 bond for each defendant and ordered that they wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their attorneys.

It was also announced Monday that 3-year-old Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, who had been missing since December, allegedly died amid a ritualistic religious ceremony intended to “cast out demonic spirits,” Reuters reported.

“It was a religious ritual carried out... a ritual intended to cast out demonic spirits from Abdul-ghani Wahhaj,” Taos County Prosecutor John Lovelace said.

Public defenders argued the boy's father was trying to heal the child by reading passages from the Koran but prosecutors claimed he was denying the boy medication. One of the children taken into custody claimed that the boy had died in February.

The children said they were told the boy would be resurrected as Jesus and guide them on which ""corrupt institutions"" to attack, NBC reported citing investigators.

It wasn’t immediately clear if the remains of a child found on the grounds of the compound were Abdul-ghani Wahhaj.

The defendants were arrested and 11 children were taken into custody during a raid Aug. 4 on the compound near the Colorado state line.

Wahhaj and the others were seated with their public defenders in a Taos courtroom Monday as prosecutors presented books that were found at the compound, documents related to Wahhaj's trip to Saudi Arabia and a handwritten notebook that appeared to be some kind of teaching manual. They also pointed to evidence that Wahhaj had taken a series of firearms courses while in Georgia.

Defense attorneys, meantime, argued that prosecutors were trying unjustly to paint their clients as armed militants. Public defenders also argued that the rifles and handguns found on the property were common guns that could be bought at retail stores and that their clients made no aggressive efforts to defend their compound.

Wahhaj is the son of a Brooklyn imam, also named Siraj Wahhaj, who was named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the New York Post reported. The elder Wahhaj, who heads Masjid At-Taqwa mosque, was a character witness in the trial for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the notorious “blind sheikh” who was convicted in 1995 of plotting terror attacks in the U.S.

But Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem informed Carswell he and whoever donates a kidney must be fully vaccinated to proceed with the transplant.

""He said, ‘The last thing we need to talk about is your vaccination status,'"" Carswell recalled, referring to a hospital conversation. ""And that’s when I politely told him there was nothing really to talk about it, it wasn’t up for debate [and] that I wasn’t getting it. Then, he told me, ‘You know you’ll die if you don’t get it.’ And I said, ‘I’m willing to die.’""

Carswell said he’s had the coronavirus twice before and believes getting the vaccine should be a personal choice, not a requirement.

BOSTON PATIENT REMOVED FROM HEART TRANSPLANT LIST BECAUSE HE'S NOT VACCINATED: FAMILY

""Without [a transplant], there’s no telling how much longer I’ll still be here. I have to have a kidney to prolong my life,"" he said.

Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Hospital said its policy follows health standards implemented across the U.S. and was put into practice to protect its patients.

""The reason it is recommended is to provide protection for the patient. Transplant patients are at high risk for severe illness if they don’t have preexisting immunity prior to being transplanted,"" the hospital said in a statement, according to WCSO.

Carswell is looking at other hospitals in the area to see if they will carry out the procedure.

An unvaccinated 31-year-old father of two in Boston, DJ Ferguson, was denied a heart transplant surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital this month despite being at the top of the list to receive the surgery. His family told "" Tucker Carlson Tonight "" Wednesday that DJ is fighting for his life after he underwent an hours-long emergency open-heart surgery and is in need of the transplant.

""He got led down a path where they had to stop doing procedures where they said he was qualified nonetheless for the heart transplant,"" the patient's father, David Ferguson, said. ""But he had to get the vaccine in order to get that transplant.

121,Want COVID-19? Sign up for world’s first COVID-19 challenge trial to evaluate immune response,Shiv Sudhakar,"

Oxford University is seeking volunteers for the world’s first medical trial that deliberately exposes participants to the original strain of the COVID-19 virus to evaluate how their immune response responds to the virus, according to a recent press statement.

""The aim of this trial is to find out what level of immune response - antibodies and T cells - we need in our bodies to prevent infection when healthy people are exposed to the virus,"" said lead investigator Helen McShane, professor of vaccinology at the department of pediatrics, University of Oxford.

She added, ""If we know what level of immune response we need the vaccine to induce, it will make future vaccine development much quicker and much more efficient.""

THOUSANDS PROTEST COVID MANDATES AND RESTRICTIONS IN OTTAWA

The statement said the participants must be between 18-30 years old and in excellent state of health before entering the study, with the study requiring them to have either received a vaccine against COVID-19 without a prior infection or previously had the infection but completely recovered.

The study began in April 2021 with its first phase to establish the lowest dose of the virus, which is the original strain from Wuhan, China, that can infect and replicate in approximately 50% of participants, but cause minimal symptoms, per the statement.

The University of Oxford noted that after a standardized dose is established in the first phase, all participants will be infected with the viral dose in the second phase.

All participants will be quarantined for at least 17 days in a designated hospital suite, get a CT lung and a heart MRI and only be discharged after they are no longer infected or infectious to others, but if any of the participants become symptomatic, they will receive the Regeneron monoclonal antibody treatment.

Day zero is when the participants get inoculated with COVID-19 in their nose, and then are tested twice a day by PCR to see if they have COVID-19 along with frequent blood tests, per the video.

Although human challenge trials, which deliberately infect people to study the effects of the infection, have been done for years, this is the first known on COVID-19, according to Reuters.

122,NYC actress fired after rant over Jason Rivera funeral: Streets closed 'for one f------ cop',Brie Stimson,"

A New York City-based actress was fired this weekend after backlash over her viral TikTok complaint that the city didn’t need to be shut down for ""one f------ cop"" whose funeral was held Friday at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, according to a report.

New York City police Officer Jason Rivera was killed Jan. 21 by a suspect while responding to a domestic dispute in Harlem. A second police officer died days later.

On Friday, thousands lined Manhattan’s streets to mourn the 22-year-old Rivera, but actress Jacqueline Guzman likely wasn’t one of them, the New York Post reported.

The actress posted a TikTok rant about street closures prompted by the funeral.

""We do not need to shut down most of Lower Manhattan because one cop died for probably doing his job incorrectly,"" she said. ""They kill people who are under 22 every single day for no good reason and we don’t shut down the city for them.""

She continued, ""Like this is f–----- ridiculous. This is f–----- ridiculous. What if somebody is having a heart attack in this area? Nobody can get to them because it’s all blocked off for one f–----- cop.""

She later deleted the post.

FALLEN NYPD OFFICER JASON RIVERA HONORED WITH MILES-LONG PROCESSION, HUNDREDS FLOCK TO ST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL

Police officers and social media commenters rebuked Guzman’s complaints, calling her ""disrespectful"" and saying she should be ""ashamed"" of herself.

""Twitter is forever. Bless your unemployed heart,"" another wrote.

""New Yorkers turned out by the thousands yesterday to help us honor our fallen brother,"" New York City Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said in a statement, according to the Post. ""One person spreading hate cannot erase that. This kind of garbage has polluted the conversation for far too long. We need the New Yorkers who are standing with us to speak up and push back.""

Her employer, Face to Face Films, wrote on its Facebook page Saturday, it had ""just been made aware of an insensitive video involving one of our members, Jacqueline Guzman. Face to Face Films does not support nor can condone these comments made about fallen Officer Rivera. As a result, she is no longer a member of our company.""

The Canadian province of Nova Scotia made it illegal for people to gather along a highway ahead of the ""Freedom Convoy"" of truckers that made their way across the country in protest of vaccine mandates.

The local government issued ""a directive under the Emergency Management Act prohibiting protesters from blockading Highway 104 near the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border.""

The directive specifically states supporters of the Freedom Convoy and another protest, the Atlantic Hold the Line event, can’t gather along Highway 104, on the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border. The directive states that ""allowing people to gather in those areas would put themselves and others at risk.""

""My message to anyone planning a blockade of a highway is — don’t do it,"" Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said last week, according to the Toronto Star . ""Nova Scotians have no patience for highway blockades and, personally ... I have even less, so just don’t do it.""

CANADIAN 'FREEDOM' TRUCKERS MASSIVE VACCINE MANDATE PROTEST CONVOY MAY SMASH WORLD RECORD

Those who disobey face fines between $3,000 to $10,000, while corporations face fines between $20,000 and $100,000.

The order remains active under the province’s state of emergency, which has been extended every two weeks and currently runs until Feb. 6, CBC News reported .

The Freedom Convoy left from Vancouver for Ottawa last Sunday to protest the federal government’s vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers, which took effect on Jan. 15. The Canadian Trucking Alliance estimates that roughly 15% of truckers in the country are not fully vaccinated , or about 16,000 truck drivers.

The organizers of the protest have called for the elimination of all COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates and others called for the removal of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

THOUSANDS PROTEST COVID MANDATES AND RESTRICTIONS IN OTTAWA

The spokesman of the convoy called the protest ""impressive"" last week, claiming it was more than 40 miles long. Guinness World Records show that the longest convoy recorded took place in Egypt in 2020, coming in at nearly 5 miles long.

Trudeau denounced the protest last week as composed of a ""small fringe minority who are on the way to Ottawa who are holding unacceptable views.""

Former President Donald Trump on Saturday night held a Save America rally in Texas, where he took shots at several Democrats and teased a 2024 presidential candidacy by saying he will give ""pardons"" to his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 last year if he runs and wins in 2024.

Trump made the comments in front of thousands of supporters, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds in Conroe, Texas.

""Another thing we'll do, and so many people have been asking me about it, if I run and if I win, we will treat those people from Jan. 6 fairly,"" Trump said, eliciting applause. ""We will treat them fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.""

""This hasn't happened to all of the other atrocities that took place recently,"" Trump continued, appearing to talk about crime across the United States. ""Nothing like this has happened. What that ‘unselect committee’ is doing and what the people are doing who are running those prisons is a disgrace. It's a disgrace. We will treat them fairly.""

A little over a year ago, lawmakers were forced to evacuate the U.S. Capitol and temporarily suspend the certification of the Electoral College results as rioters plowed through police perimeters and breached the building and occupied it for several hours.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia charged more than 700 people across the country for their alleged participation in the riot, including at least 81 current or former service members, CBS News reported. About 275 Capitol riot defendants have been charged with a felony offense of attempting to ""corruptly obstruct, influence, or impede"" the Electoral College certification and more than 530 defendants have yet to stand trial.

Later during the rally, Trump attacked President Biden for preparing to send troops over to Europe to help defend Ukraine against a potential attack from Russia, saying the U.S. border should be top priority.

ABC’s ""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg declared the Holocaust was ""not about race"" despite the systematic killing of an estimated six million Jews, leading to sharp criticism of the outspoken liberal.

It doesn’t matter if you’re Black, or White, cause Black ,White, Jews, Italians, everybody eats each other.""

Goldberg was pilloried online for her take, as Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler believed in a ""master race"" and attempted the complete elimination of the Jewish race in Europe.

Critics are slamming a government-funded Canadian news outlet for suggesting Russia is behind the popular ""Freedom Convoy"" protest, where truckers drove across the country in protest of a vaccine mandate.

""I do ask that because given Canada's support of Ukraine, in this current crisis with Russia, I don't know if it's far-fetched to ask,"" CBC host Nil Koksal told Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino Friday.

""But there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows. But perhaps even instigating it from, from the outset.""

Video of the exchange had been viewed nearly half a million times as of Sunday morning.

""Again, I'm gonna defer to our partners in the public safety of trained officials and experts in that area,"" Mendicino responded, deflecting the question.

The CBC is a Canadian public broadcaster that is funded by the government. The Freedom Convoy has been described as a grassroots movement; it has no known ties to Russia.

Koksal’s remarks set off a torrent of criticism on Twitter, with people slamming the current state of media, questioning how the clip is real and slamming liberals for focusing on ""Russia, Russia, Russia.""

132,Tucker Carlson: Hungarian architecture proves Americans don't understand 'how bad it can get',Charles Creitz,"

Fox News host Tucker Carlson offered remarks at a recent event in Hungary, after holding an exclusive interview with Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Carlson spoke of the dichotomy between the present state of the United States, politically, architecturally and culturally, to that of Hungary under the self-described ‘Christian-democratic' Orban.

The ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" host remarked that architecture in Hungary is much different than the ""dehumanizing"" glass and steel of the United States, which he described as essentially demeaning to those who work and live in it. Contemporary U.S. structure are built for personnel and occupational capacity, which removes the importance of the individual:

""Dehumanizing is the act of convincing people that they don't matter, that they are less significant than the larger whole, that they are not distinct souls, that they are not unique, that they are not created by God, that they are merely putty in the hands of some larger force that they must obey,"" Carlson said.

""Mies van der Rohe architecture was designed to send that message not to uplift, but to oppress. And it is very noticeable and this is never noted in the United States, which unfortunately over time has had its aesthetic sense dulled. We've been told it's not important,"" he said, keying into the dehumanization aspect once again:

""What matters is GDP really, you know, get the new microwave or whatever. The new car, the new place in Aspen.""

In contrast, Hungarian and Central European architecture is essentially a lesson to the West of how good Americans have it, to the point that they don't understand or can't fathom the world across the oceans from them, the host continued.

He pointed to bullet holes still lodged in the Gothic buildings – something few places in the U.S. outside of towns like Gettysburg, Pa., or Franklin, Tenn., – can lay claim to.

To the American observer, Carlson said, seeing buildings wracked with wartime damage prove ""a very useful reminder"" to those who don't collectively have memories or fears of things going bad in that way in one's daily life.

""I wish I lived in a city full of bullet holes in the building because every morning you look at them and you think to yourself, it could be really bad because it's been really bad. There's a lot at stake,"" he said, adding that the permanently damaged buildings remind Hungarians to ""make wise, sober, long term decisions or else you could wind up with more bullet holes.""

""I could spend all day leveling very accurate accusations against the American foreign policy establishment, but the main one would be that they have no sense of how bad things can get,"" he said, calling it the ""bad side of the upside of America.""

""America is an optimistic country, always has been,"" Carlson said noting that the pilgrims ""showed up in this mostly untouched continent with the most fertile farmland in the world and an ocean to separate us from the lunatics,"" he remarked.

""And it gave us the feeling that anything is possible and everything has been possible. And I've never stopped being grateful for that or proud of it. But the downside to that, the flip side, the obverse, the other side of the coin, as you say in Hungary, is that Americans have no sense of how bad things can get, that it actually could be a lot worse. Our physical isolation cuts us off from the history of the rest of the world.""

""There's not a passion to study what happened before in a place that you're building a new. Right, right. So we don't have a sense of that. So I love your bullet holes. Let me just say, I'm probably the only visitor to your nation has complimented your small arms and artillery scars …The buildings are pretty. The architecture uplifts. So this is another this is another third rail of American politics,"" Carlson said.

Carlson also remarked about how well Hungarian citizens speak the foreign language English very well:

""Every Hungarian I have met, every from the driver to the waiter to the border guard had better English than our own president,"" he said.

He added that Hungary's emphasis on national security is another unfortunate dichotomy between Orban's Hungary and Biden's America.

Recalling a visit to a border station, Carlson spoke about being impressed by a tacit but ""powerful display"" as he asked a Hungarian border guard how often throngs of illegal immigrants come across the border or its fence. The guard silently stopped his pace, looked down, and picked up a plastic wrapper, and moved on.

""I don't think I've I have seen in my life very few displays more powerful than that,"" Carlson said.",https://www.foxnews.com
133,US truckers slam Facebook for removing page organizing DC freedom convoy: 'Censorship at its finest',Amy Nelson,"

American truckers are following Canada’s lead and organizing a protest against vaccine mandates. The U.S. group’s Facebook page, however, was removed early Wednesday in a move that the organizer called ""censorship at its finest.""

The group, titled ""Convoy to D.C. 2022,"" acted as a place for truckers to plan and coordinate their trek from California to Washington, D.C.

CRITICS MOCK ‘PUPPET’ TRUDEAU FOR FLEEING CAPITAL DURING TRUCKERS PROTEST: ‘TYRANT ON THE RUN’

Jeremy Johnson, who set up the Facebook group, said his personal account was also removed, prompting him to contact a civil rights attorney to discuss the next steps.

""They like to silence people that speak the truth,"" Johnson said of his Facebook ban.

A spokesperson for Facebook’s parent company, Meta, provided this statement to Fox News: ""We have removed this group for repeatedly violating our policies around QAnon."" In October 2020, Facebook labeled QAnon a ""violence-inducing conspiracy network"" and announced group pages and admins tied to QAnon will be removed.

Brian Brase, co-organizer of the event, disputed the way Facebook characterized the group.

""I have to laugh about that. Can they contact me or something? Can we talk? That's not true,"" he asked on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday. ""They actually had offered the administrators to remove content and then request to review again. They didn’t even give that option.

""They literally wiped Mike Landis and Jeremy completely out of Facebook,"" he said. ""They don’t even have a profile anymore, so how are you supposed to request a review or remove anything?""

Landis, a trucker involved in the freedom convoy, told host Carley Shimkus that this movement is ""a long time coming."" He said Americans are tired of the ""government overreach"" and criticized politicians for, as he believes, not following the Constitution.

""The presence of that amount of people that show that they are unhappy with what’s going on is a good way to hopefully get their attention,"" he said.

Johnson and Brase anticipate a wide range of Americans, not only truckers, will come out to support their cause.

""This crosses all genders, all races, all sexual orientations, all occupations,"" Brase said. ""Truckers might be standing up, but it’s not about the truckers. It’s about America.""

The Freedom Convoy of truckers left Vancouver for Ottawa on Jan. 23 to protest the federal government’s vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers and is calling for an end to coronavirus restrictions. The convoy reached Ottawa this weekend and police estimated between 5,000 to 18,000 people were on the streets Saturday. The number is estimated to have come down to the hundreds of protesters as of Wednesday.

Two people were also arrested in connection to ""mischief to property"" and carrying a weapon to a public meeting.

Police set up a hate crime hotline this week, but admitted that the protests have remained peaceful. There have been no riots, injuries or deaths since the protests kicked off over the weekend.

137,Tucker Carlson: There's no more fearful despot than Canada's Prime Minister,Tucker Carlson,"

Do you ever notice how almost all of the leaders of almost all the countries in the Western world, particularly in the English-speaking Western world, seem kind of the same? They're what we call neoliberal. They're all weak and fearful, if you think about it. And yet if you listen to them talk, you'd think they were omnipotent: 'We're going to reverse global climate change. We're going to vaccinate the world. We're going to end all human prejudice and replace it with equity. We're going to spread democracy to the untutored nations with guns, and they're going to love us for it. We can do all these things because we're all-powerful. We're like gods. You shall have no gods before us.'

Now, mostly they're puny people. But when they speak, they sound like Caesar standing in purple robes in the forum, commanding the known world. Joe Biden very often sounds like this, so does that squeaky little woman with weird teeth who runs New Zealand. They all sound like this. They're unbelievably grandiose. It's by design. They'd rather talk about redeeming humanity than bother to fix your kid's school or replace the stop sign at the end of your block.

CRITICS MOCK ‘PUPPET’ TRUDEAU FOR FLEEING CAPITAL DURING TRUCKERS PROTEST: ‘TYRANT ON THE RUN’

So you've got to wonder, why do they talk this way? And the answer, of course, is because they're terrified. They claim to be powerful because they know they're not. It's a bluff. It's a calculated pose. In fact, they know exactly how weak they are. They understand how little popular support they actually have, and they can feel their grasp slipping. And if you wonder if that's true, notice how they overreact to the slightest challenge to their power. Remember a year ago when the QAnon Shaman skipped through Congress on his mescaline trip, giggling and spreading good vibes? It was kind of amusing. But Democrats in Washington were panicked by it, so panicked they called in the U.S. Army and sent that poor guy to prison. It's weird how touchy they get when you suggest they stole the presidential election, I wonder why?

But this is not the behavior of secure leaders. This is how despots act when they fear they're about to be overthrown. And there's no more fearful despot in the world than Justin Trudeau of Canada. Over the span of just a few years, Trudeau has turned a nation long famous for Molson and sled dogs in niceness into a relentlessly punitive surveillance state. People have long whispered, in dead seriousness, that Justin Trudeau is the biological son of Fidel Castro. You could laugh it off, but now it's becoming pretty easy to believe. Trudeau has used systematically COVID to short circuit democracy in Canada and to end organized Christianity there.

Canadians can no longer travel freely within their own country. They can no longer return to their own country at certain parts. Pastors have been imprisoned for holding church services. The unvaccinated can be sent to jail for buying certain products in stores. In the town of Gatineau, family members were arrested for celebrating New Year's Eve in their own home. Every large institution in Canada pretends like all of this is perfectly normal, it's always been this way. Canadian media, which are largely controlled by the government, support these policies and Trudeau uncritically. In Nova Scotia, protests against Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates are now banned by law.

CANADIAN NEWS HOST SLAMMED FOR SUGGESTING RUSSIA BEHIND MASSIVE 'FREEDOM' TRUCKER PROTEST

Rarely has a nation changed this quickly or more unequivocally for the worse. And last week, thousands of Canadian truckers reached their limit. A convoy of truckers converged on the capital city of Ottawa to demand, peacefully, cheerfully but persistently an end to Justin Trudeau's tyranny. Justin Trudeau's response to this display of democracy? He fled the city. Trudeau evacuated his official residence and hid in an undisclosed location. He is still cowering there tonight. Will he come back? Has he abdicated? Will Canada be ruled by a junta of truckers? Well, not at this point. He emerged by video conference from his lair to declare that Canadian citizens who disagree with him are in fact attacking democracy.

TRUDEAU: There is a right to protest, there is a right to make your voices heard, loudly and clearly. There is not a right to shut down our democracy or our democratic processes, there is not a right to abuse, intimidate and harass your fellow citizens.

So expressing your views is an attack on democracy? And by the way, how dare you express your views as if you were free people. That's tyranny. Democracy is when you obey like serfs. Trudeau just effectively said that. And then because he has no self-awareness whatsoever, Trudeau announced that he's contracted COVID, which is perfect. In other words, take this shot or else, as you can see from the fact I am now sick, it works perfectly.

NOVA SCOTIA OUTLAWS SUPPORT ON HIGHWAY FOR 'FREEDOM' TRUCKERS DAYS AFTER MASSIVE PROTEST

If Canada were in a country, it would be a remarkable dark comedy. So you may be wondering about these hordes of Visigoths who's descended on Ottawa, the ones who drove Justin Trudeau out of the city. What do they look like?

Freedom, love, patriotic displays waving Canadian flags. Terrifying. But if you look closely at those pictures, you can see the real problem. These were working-class people. They're the guys who deliver your Amazon boxes. And Justin Trudeau is repulsed by them. These people have stepped way outside their lanes. Just leave the package on the porch and get the hell out of here. But they haven't gotten the hell out of there. They're still in Ottawa, and Justin Trudeau won't meet with them because he never meets with people like this, not simply because they are blue-collar and dirty, though obviously they are, but because they disagree with him. As a reminder from Justin Trudeau, that's what democracy is. Democracy is lecturing people who nod a lot in response. Watch him explain.

TRUDEAU: I have attended protests and rallies in the past when I agreed with the goals, when I supported the people expressing their concerns and their issues, Black Lives Matter is an excellent example of that.

So I'll meet with the people at a rally as long as I agree with their goals, as long as they agree with me, it's totally fine, like Black Lives Matter. You get the sense even someone as dim as Justin Trudeau realizes this is not a winning argument. He needed his friends in state media to help. So they trotted out some attack lines against the truckers lines they borrowed directly from CNN and NBC News here in the States. So here's Canada's state broadcaster inventing a claim, out of nothing, that Vladimir Putin himself may be responsible for this trucker convoy.

TRUDEAU SLAMS ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ FOR ‘HATEFUL RHETORIC,’ PREFERS TO SUPPORT BLM PROTESTERS

CBC NEWS: You know, given Canada's support of Ukraine in this current crisis with Russia, I don't know if it's farfetched to ask, but there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this, as this protest grows, but perhaps even instigating it from the outset.

Russia. You've got to love Canada. But let's be honest, they always steal our ideas and produce a slightly shoddy copy of them. We have Wal-Mart, they have Canadian Tire, not to be mean. Russia, of course, Putin did it. There's no evidence of that. No sources. They've just been reading American Twitter. And the state media anchor is deeply concerned. Who buys this? No one's going to buy this, it's so prima fascia absurd, so they just kept going. Here's Justin Trudeau from his bunker offering yet another reason to distrust the hunta running the newly formed nation of Truckistan, formerly known as Canada.

TRUDEAU: We won't give in to those who fly racist flags. We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.

CANADIAN 'FREEDOM' TRUCKERS MASSIVE VACCINE MANDATE PROTEST CONVOY MAY SMASH WORLD RECORD

Dishonor the memory, too many Canadian flags. There are like three bad people in the crowd, so ignore them all, ladies and gentlemen. Thankfully, by contrast, no one in any BLM rally ever torched a courthouse or shot anybody or burned down a building. But these truckers, apparently, there was a racist flag. So pay no attention. Now in the United States, we probably wouldn't fall for this at this late date. We're a little jaded at this point because we've seen it so many times. Oh, they had a Confederate flag, never mind, we can ignore their concerns. The election was totally fine.

So again, we've seen it before. But in Canada, they probably haven't seen it, they're a few years behind us. And so, you know, they're kind of impressed by it. Claims like this happened here a few months ago, as you may remember, when Democratic operatives carried around tiki torches to smear Glenn Youngkin as a White supremacist. Again, Trudeau had reason to think Canadians hadn't seen that, and he might be able to get away with it. Trudeau has been honing this line of argument for months now. Last September, you may remember he accused people who opposed mandatory vaccination, getting a shot because the government requires it, of being racist.

TRUDEAU: But also, there are people who are fiercely opposed to vaccination. Who don’t believe in science. Who are often misogynist, often racist too.

Poor Canadians. They're good people. They don't have a lot of news sources. They've been exposed nonstop for two years to this kind of propaganda. If you don't believe in mandatory injection with an experimental medicine, you're a racist. Apparently, some believe it, at least one counter-protester this weekend believed it.

WASHINGTON POST, MSNBC TRASH CANADIAN ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ TRUCKERS: ‘IT’S A CULT'

SECOND PROTESTER: I am not White; this has nothing to do with White. This is nothing to do with truckers. This is about freedom for all Canadians. You can't be Brown, Black, White, whatever color you want to be. This is about freedom. Trudeau no right to put us in this condition or indeed want the country to going to school. It's a terrible thing to do.

Oh, thank God for Rebel News. You think Fox is an anomaly in the United States, how would you like to be Rebel News? Literally the only people in all of Canada who are playing it straight. So there they are, trying to tell you that some guy from the subcontinent is a w=White nationalist. They're trying, they're trying hard. And now they have evidence, it's brought to you by CNN, naturally, working in tandem with the CBC. Apparently, brace yourselves, there was a Trump sign in the crowd of truckers.

CNN: Given the potential risk, Jim, Justin Trudeau and his family, he has three kids, live about a mile from Parliament Hill. They have now been moved somewhere. We don't know where, it's an undisclosed location out of an abundance of caution. I will also say that former President Trump certainly is supporting this group. I've been out there. I have seen Trump supporter signs out there. And this leads to a larger question, Jim. They're still in the downtown core. Police just released a statement saying, look, we need the trucks to leave, we need people to leave, this city has to start functioning again, and the issue is how to leave. The people who have organized this say that they will stay out there months if needed.

JIM ACOSTA CNN: All right. And we know you'll stay on top of it. Alarming situation there in Ottawa. … thank you very much.

‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ BANS MAINSTREAM MEDIA FROM FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE: ‘SABOTAGE’

Now we don't know who that woman is, but she should be completely ashamed of herself. She's a journalist, and yet she just told you that the ruling party of Canada wants the people who are protesting their policies to leave. And then she nods gravely that they need to leave. Things need to get back to normal. They've got to run the city doing all the important things that Canadians do in Ottawa. CNN is siding openly with the Trudeau government, because you can't challenge power. I mean, that's what we do in the media is to remind you: Obey, accept your fate, rich people have spoken, get in line. And we've got a Trump flag to prove it.

But it gets worse. There were more racist flags this weekend. One of them imported conspicuously from this country. Now we have definitive evidence of this. We're getting this from Canadian media that there was a racist in the crowd.

TWITTER VIDEO (to a man holding a confederate flag): But now he's going, now he's gone. We called him out. He knows he's going to hold his head in shame now.

Oh, it's so great. You'll notice in the shot there's only one person who has his face completely covered. And he happens to be carrying a Confederate flag. Now the crowd looks at him and says, oh, wait a second, we know who you are, you're Ray Epps. Oh, sorry, but we don't trust you. In exactly the way the crowd in Washington the night before January 6th of last year said to Ray Epps, Get out of here, fed.

So the people on the scene didn't believe that guy was anything but a provocateur, and we don't know exactly who he was. We'll let you make your own conclusions from that. But we're supposed to believe that this one guy in the full face mask with a Confederate flag proves the entire protest is racist. Justin Trudeau has every reason to run away like a terrified, wuss that he is, and we can ignore the concerns of the people in the trucker convoy. But we've got a couple of questions.

Who exactly was that guy holding the flag and where is Justin Trudeau right now? It's not clear where he was broadcasting from this weekend, but what is clear is that unlike Saddam or Moammar Gadhafi, we're never going to be able to find out.

Now you think to yourself in a democracy, you should know what the head of state is, right? Don't you have a right if you're a voter, shouldn't Canadians have a right to know where he is? Yeah, but it doesn't matter because Justin Trudeau can hide anywhere. He's a master of disguise. Any place in the world Justin Trudeau could blend in, and you'd never know it was him.

Interesting. You can also see him blending in convincingly as a Bollywood star in India. Hands grasp together in reverence and prayer. Or, you can see him flanked by his new countrymen, they have no idea they're in the presence of a Canadian politician. That's how convincing Justin Trudeau is when he decides to play dress-up. They think he's one of them. I love samosas, Justin says. We do, too, say the Indians. They have no idea they're talking to a Canadian. But when he's not fooling people in India, he's fooling Native Americans. And yes, there is a difference bigot. Not all Indians are the same. Justin Trudeau wore the traditional headdress of one of Canada's many indigenous tribes, like the Aztecs, Justin Trudeau will rip your heart out, ladies. And, is that Clark Kent of Superman fame? No, once again, is just Justin Trudeau.

He can impersonate fictional characters. You can see him looking like a stranded pilot in the desert from one of the Star Wars movies. He could literally be hiding on a soundstage in Hollywood as we speak. He can even be on a ranch. Unbelievable. As long as no one hands him a gun or asked him where food comes from, that's a convincing rancher right there. So, yes, Justin Trudeau can change far more than his skin color.

142,"Lockdowns only reduced COVID-19 death rate by .2%, study finds: 'Lockdowns should be rejected out of hand'",Paul Best,"

Lockdowns during the first COVID-19 wave in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by .2% in the U.S. and Europe, according to a Johns Hopkins University meta-analysis of several studies.

""While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted,"" the researchers wrote. ""In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.""

The researchers – Johns Hopkins University economics professor Steve Hanke, Lund University economics professor Lars Jonung, and special advisor at Copenhagen's Center for Political Studies Jonas Herby – analyzed the effects of lockdown measures such as school shutdowns, business closures, and mask mandates on COVID-19 deaths.

""We find little to no evidence that mandated lockdowns in Europe and the United States had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality rates,"" the researchers wrote.

The researchers also examined shelter-in-place orders, finding that they reduced COVID-19 mortality by 2.9%.

Studies that looked at only shelter-in-place orders found they reduced COVID-19 mortality by 5.1%, but studies that looked at shelter-in-place orders along with other lockdown measures found that shelter-in-place orders actually increased COVID-19 mortality by 2.8%.

CHICAGO GUNSHOP SEES SKYROCKETING SALES FOLLOWING LOCKDOWNS, CRIME SPIKE

The researchers concluded that limiting gatherings may have actually increased COVID-19 mortality.

""[Shelter-in-place orders] may isolate an infected person at home with his/her family where he/she risks infecting family members with a higher viral load, causing more severe illness,"" the researchers wrote.

""But often, lockdowns have limited peoples’ access to safe (outdoor) places such as beaches, parks, and zoos, or included outdoor mask mandates or strict outdoor gathering restrictions, pushing people to meet at less safe (indoor) places.""

The researchers also examined studies that focused on specific lockdown measures and found that the only intervention that reduced COVID-19 mortality was the closure of non-essential businesses, which reduced mortality by 10.6%, but this effect was likely driven by the closure of bars.

Researchers also pointed out other unintended consequences of lockdowns, such as rising unemployment, reduced schooling, an increase in domestic violence incidents, and surging drug overdoses.

From May 2020 to April 2021, the U.S. recorded 100,306 drug overdose deaths, a 28.5% increase from the 78,056 deaths that were recorded in the previous 12-month period, according to CDC data.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AT-HOME COVID TEST WEBSITE LAUNCHES

A study from the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice last year found that domestic violence incidents increased 8.1% in the U.S. after lockdown orders were issued.

About 97% of U.S. teachers said that their students have experienced learning loss during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Horace Mann survey last year.

The unemployment rate peaked nationwide at 14.8% in April 2020, but declined to 3.9% in December, which is still slightly higher than the 3.5% rate it was at in February 2020.

""These costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns, which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best,"" the researchers in the Johns Hopkins University study wrote.

""Such a standard benefit-cost calculation leads to a strong conclusion: lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.""

143,Virginia's Capitol flooded with gun rights activists for Second Amendment rally,Barnini Chakraborty,"

RICHMOND, Va. — A gun-rights rally in Richmond that brought thousands of people from across the country to protest a push by Virginia Democrats for comprehensive gun control ended peacefully without any major incidents.

Threats of violence had escalated in the days leading up to Monday's demonstration following reports that white supremacists, armed militia and other extremist groups were planning to attend.

Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, had declared a state of emergency late last week and beefed up security around the Capitol.

""Thousands of people came to Richmond to make their voices heard,"" he said in a statement Monday evening. ""Today showed that when people disagree, they can do so peacefully. The issues before us evoke strong emotions, and progress is often difficult. I will continue to listen to the voices of Virginians, and I will continue to do everything in my power to keep our commonwealth safe.""

The Joint Information Center, made up of representatives from the Capitol, Richmond and Virginia State Police, estimated 6,000 people were allowed into a fenced-in area of Capitol Square.

They estimated another 16,000 were outside the gates, though event organizers said many more had turned out. Many of those outside the barrier carried long firearms and wore bright orange stickers that read ""Guns Save Lives.""

Capitol Police said a 21-year-old woman had been arrested and charged with one felony count of wearing a mask in public. Law enforcement said they warned the woman twice to remove a bandana covering her face but she had refused.

Monday's event brought people from every corner of the country to stand next to Second Amendment supporters.

""If they can come for your guns in Virginia, they can come for them in West Virginia,” demonstrator Annette Parker told Fox News, noting that she drove six hours to get to the event.

The throngs who gathered in Richmond Monday were heard in large groups reciting the Second Amendment in unison, while others broke out in chants of ""we will not comply!""

SECURITY MEASURES HEIGHTENED AS RALLY EXPECTED TO DRAW BIG TURNOUT

When one speaker asked the crowd if they were ready for gun control, the crowd yelled back, ”No!”

Other speakers, including Republican Delegate John McGuire III, used the event to drum up support for President Trump, who tweeted earlier this morning that the ""Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights.""

“Let me hear if you’re sick and tired of Republicans who do not support President Trump,"" McGuire said, revving up those in attendance.

The president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League – the nonprofit organizer of the rally – told Fox News that it wasn't the pro-gun groups who had been stoking fear of potential violence at the event.

""It's the Democrats,"" Philip Van Cleave said. ""It's almost like they want something to happen. It sounds crazy, but they keep doing it and you have to start wondering if that's intentional.""

Stacks of chain-link fencing, white tents and rows of metal detectors were in place early Monday morning as some demonstrators began making their way inside the Capitol grounds. But many instead decided to stand outside the security perimeter with their guns.

Others were seen carrying American and Gadsden flags, while some were passing around petitions demanding the ouster of Gov. Ralph Northam, the state’s Democrat leader.

VIRGINIA BRACES FOR RALLY AS WORRIES OVER VIOLENCE, HATE GROUPS AND MILITIAS GROW

Members associated with the Light Foot Militia, some of whom were banned from Charlottesville, Va., following the deadly 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally, were expected to attend Monday's protest. Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, has indicated he might make an appearance.

Last week, three gun control-related bills advanced in Virginia’s General Assembly, setting the stage for a contentious showdown between gun rights advocates and the Democratic lawmakers, who campaigned on bringing changes to the state following last year's mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal complex.

The bills that sailed through the Senate Judiciary Committee propose to require background checks on all firearms purchases; allow law enforcement to temporarily remove guns from people deemed to be a risk to themselves or others; limit handgun purchases to one a month; and let localities decide on whether to ban weapons from certain events. To become law, the bills would have to pass the full Senate and the House of Delegates before going to the governor for his signature.

In a symbolic sign of defiance, more than 100 municipalities in Virginia have designated themselves as a safe haven or sanctuary for the Second Amendment. Lawmakers and authorities in those areas have said they will refuse to enforce new gun control laws the Virginia Legislature passes.

NORTHAM'S VIRGINIA CAPITOL WEAPONS BAN UPHELD BY JUDGE AHEAD OF PRO-GUN RALLY

The state’s only self-proclaimed socialist Democrat, Lee Carter, has said he will be heading to an “undisclosed location” to work Monday instead of the Capitol.

“People were threatening to murder me and murder my family over something I’m not even doing,” Carter told multiple media outlets. “These threats are more hateful and more numerous than anything I’ve seen before. I mean, I’m the only socialist elected to a legislature in the South, so I do occasionally get waves of death threats -- about every two three months it’ll happen -- but this one is far larger and far more serious than anything I’ve seen before by orders of magnitude.”

Carter said he has reported the threats to the Virginia Capitol Police.

But some demonstrators in Richmond tell Fox News he should make an appearance.

""I think it's ridiculous a former Marine would stay at home,” said Angela Darton of Fairfax County. “If he's so anti-Second Amendment, you'd think he'd make an effort to be here.""

Monday's rally was part of Lobby Day, an annual event in Virginia where advocates of a variety of causes descend on Richmond's Capitol Square to plead their cases to legislators. Gun rights advocates have shown up in past years but the turnout Monday has grown astronomically.

The rally Monday also came about two and a half years after a deadly incident in Charlottesville, in which hundreds of white nationalists and their supporters gathered about 70 miles from Richmond to demonstrate over plans to remove a Confederate statue. They were met by counterprotesters and violence quickly erupted. At one point, a vehicle drove into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one and injuring more than a dozen others.",https://www.foxnews.com
144,Leaked video shows federal contractors flying migrants to suburban NY: 'Betraying the American people',Emma Colton,"

Leaked video shows migrants being transported on secret charter flights under the cover of night from southern border states to Westchester, New York.

""The government is betraying the American people,"" a federal contractor told a Westchester County police officer in a conversation recorded on the officer’s body camera on the tarmac of a Westchester airport on Aug. 13, 2021.

The footage was obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino. Reports first surfaced of such flights back in October when the New York Post captured video of the scene at the airport in White Plains, New York .

MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS INCREASED AGAIN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN DECEMBER: COURT DOCS

""Our government is completely out of control right now. They have lied to us. They've lied to the American people,"" Astorino, who is running as a Republican for the governor of New York, said Wednesday on Fox News’ ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

Astorino said he personally saw the migrants being put on a bus to a Costco, where they were ""then released into cars into the community.""

The 51-minute footage of the August incident shows Westchester Police Sgt. Michael Hamborsky peppering federal contractors early in the morning with questions about the after-hours flights and why local police were not provided details.

""You’re on a secure facility here; we really don’t know anything and we’re in charge of security,"" he told one of the contractors.

""This is anti all our security stuff,"" Hamborsky said.

Such flights first streamed into the suburban airport from places such as McAllen, and Houston, Texas, last August, according to the New York Post. They only stopped after the outlet captured footage of the scenes back in October.

DHS' NEW YORK AIRPORT FLIGHTS PROVES US TAXPAYER FUNDING 'FINAL STEP OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING:' 'THE FIVE'

Employees of MVM Inc., a private security firm that signed a $136 million contract with the federal government last year to transport migrants around the country, were also onboard the flight, the New York Post reported.

""I’m just trying to figure out what’s what, who’s who and how I’m supposed to keep this secure,"" Hamborsky told the contractors as he continued asking questions.

""We’re not allowed to have our picture taken when we get on base,"" one contractor told the officer as they began showing him lanyards around their necks.

""Un-f–king-believable,"" Hamborsky responded. ""And who’s that by? DHS [Department of Homeland Security]?""

""Yes, and the United States Army,"" the contractor responded. ""You’re on a federal installation but DHS wants everything on the down low.""

Another contractor told Hamborsky: ""Listen, my thing is I like to comply but technically we’re not supposed to show IDs or anything. Like I said, everything is supposed to be hush hush.""

Hamborsky asked one contractor why they were coming to suburban Westchester, which is about 35 miles outside of New York City.

BIDEN ADMIN FORMALLY TERMINATED KEY TRUMP-ERA MIGRATION AGREEMENTS AT HEIGHT OF BORDER CRISIS

""You don’t want to be in somewhere the spotlight is,"" the contractor replied. ""You want to try and be as down low as possible. A lot of this is just down-low stuff that we don’t tell people because what we don’t want to do is attract attention. We don’t want the media. Like we don’t even know where we’re going when they tell us.""

One of the contractors told the officer later in the video: ""I get the whole secrecy and all that s–t but this is even above my f–king pay grade . . . the f- -k, you know what I mean?""

""And why? You know why?"" Hamborsky asked.

""You know why, look who’s in office. That’s why, come on,"" the contractor said.

""But what’s the big secret?"" the cop asked.

""You know why. Because if this gets out, the government is betraying the American people,"" the contractor said.

Hamborsky also asked a bus driver where he is taking the migrants, but the driver said he isn’t sure.

""They didn’t tell you where it’s going?"" he asked the bus driver.

""They never do,"" the driver responded.

MIDNIGHT RUNS: BIDEN SECRETLY FLYING UNDERAGE MIGRANTS INTO NY IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT

Hamborsky later learned that some of the buses were headed to Delaware, Virginia and New Jersey.

""We’re a family-owned business,"" one driver explained. ""We’re subcontractors of a government contractor . . . It’s one of those things you can’t turn down because once you sign the contract, you’re a slave to the grind.""

Astorino told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson this video shows a ""complete breakdown of our system.""

""Now they keep saying ‘it’s just unaccompanied kids.’ Completely a lie. And that these kids were not going to go into our own area. Completely a lie. [They’re being put] into schools in Westchester, Long Island, the surrounding suburbs. So it is a complete breakdown of our system. It is a betrayal, as that gentleman said, a betrayal to the American people.""

""We have a government that continues to lie to us, that has failed in its most essential duty to secure our nation's borders, and uphold the rule of law. When we first found out about these flights, we were attacked for demanding simple answers. They kept lying and deflecting, but this is a matter of public safety, public health and the people’s right to know,"" Astorino told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

He also questioned why Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has not weighed in on the flights.

""And where’s our governor? Kathy Hochul is so obsessed with keeping our kids in masks and coddling career criminals that she hasn't bothered to utter a word about these flights or bringing the crises on the southern border into our neighborhoods in Westchester, Long Island and the rest of the suburbs.""

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on the video.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in October that, ""It is our legal responsibility to safely care for unaccompanied children until they can be swiftly reunited with a parent or a vetted sponsor.""

IMMIGRATION ACTIVISTS WALK OUT ON BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DURING MEETING IN PROTEST: 'TURNING POINT'

About 2,000 children flew into the Westchester airport from June to late October, NBC New York reported in the fall. About two million migrants overall came across the Mexico-U.S. border in 2021, according to the New York Post.

President Biden has faced repeated criticism and outrage over his administration’s handling of immigration and the migrant crisis at the southern border. Conservatives have slammed the president for ending construction of the border, limiting the ability of ICE to arrest and deport illegal immigrants and terminating asylum cooperative agreements.

145,Bouncy castle accident kills 5 children during school celebration: 'Our hearts are breaking',Nicole Pelletiere,"

A tragedy has occurred involving the deaths of multiple children after a bouncy castle was lifted 33 feet into the air by wind in Australia, according to Tasmania Police.

At least five children have died and four others are in critical condition as of Thursday [Australia time], the Associated Press reported.

""On a day where these children were meant to be celebrating their last day at primary school, instead we are all mourning their loss,"" Commissioner Darren Hine said in a statement on Tasmania Police’s website.

Hine said among the children who lost their lives were ""two boys and two girls in year 6, which would make them 10 or 11 years old,"" according to the AP. Hine said the fifth child died in the hospital.

The incident took place at Hillcrest Primary School in Devonport, Tasmania, Australia. Fox News has requested comment from Hillcrest Primary School as well as Tasmania Police.

""Our hearts are breaking for those affected by the Hillcrest Primary School incident today. Taken too soon,"" Tasmania Police wrote on Facebook Wednesday, offering phone numbers to 24-hour mental health counseling hotlines.

POLICE WARN PARENTS AGAINST BACK-TO-SCHOOL PHOTO TREND

Hillcrest Primary School announced on Facebook it was closing the school for the remainder of the day. ""We ask that parents come to collect their children as a matter of urgency,"" Hillcrest wrote in its post.

Tasmania Police said an investigation is underway with involvement from WorkSafe Tasmania – a government safety organization in Tasmania.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said inflatable bounce houses are ""not without risk"" with 12 deaths being reported to the U.S. government agency from 2003-2013. The CPSC estimated there were more than 18,000 injuries associated with bounce houses which were treated in hospital emergency departments.

Fox News reached out to the CPSC for additional comment on bounce house safety.

The CPSC said if it’s windy outside, people should not use a bounce house. When using a bounce house, the maximum wind speed should be no more than 15 to 25 mph, the CPSC writes on its website. Search engine results of wind speed in Devonport Thursday was 9 to 14 mph during daytime hours. It is not yet known if the bounce house in this incident was staked to the ground.

5 children are dead after wind lifted a bouncy house 33 feet into the air in Australia. https://t.co/DWB8Ew6HBj — Fox12Oregon (@fox12oregon) December 16, 2021

More tips fo families from the CPSC on how to stay safe while using bounce houses:

-Follow manufacturer’s instructions for set up.

-Make sure the bounce house is properly staked and anchored on a flat, even surface.

-Never place bounce houses near tree branches, power lines or fences.

-Only children about the same age and size should be jumping at one time. Always observe the maximum occupancy limit.

-Teach children to play safely – not tumble, wrestle or do flips.

-Keep children away from any gas generators or air pumps, especially if standing water is nearby.

-Children should always be supervised by an adult, and or staff from the company which is operating the bounce house.

Tasmania Police wrote on its site that support and counseling are available to all, including emergency service workers who responded to the call. A GoFundMe page titled Support for Families - Hillcrest Primary School has raised more than $225,000 by an organizer named Zoe Smith, who claims to be a Devonport community member.

""All funds will go to the families of the children who were tragically killed and injured too not only support them but provide them with much needed gifts in this time of such sadness,"" Smith wrote.",https://www.foxnews.com

Brazen thieves in New York were seen on camera stealing high-end purses from a Louis Vuitton location in Westchester.

""The pro-criminal policies of @GovKathyHochul (ie. No cash bail) have made communities all across NY less safe. This brazen robbery of a @LouisVuitton occurred at my local mall @TheWestchester in White Plains,"" Republican New York gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino tweeted Friday accompanied by the video.

The video shows people inside the store last month attempting to stop the two suspects from grabbing the high-end purses. A man who appears to be a mall security guard is seen in the background watching the skirmish and not assisting.

Both of the suspects are seen booking it out of the store with stolen purses in hand.

""The crime depicted in this video is unacceptable and we are fully cooperating with the White Plains Police Department in their investigation,"" a spokesperson for The Westchester mall told the New York Post .

""We have taken a number of additional steps to further enhance the security program at The Westchester, including adding White Plains police officers to patrol the property, increasing additional private security patrol, deploying specially trained K-9 patrols, among other measures.""

POLICE UNIONS BLAME ACLU FOR RASH OF RECENT SMASH-AND-GRAB ROBBERIES: 'VOTERS WERE LIED TO'

Astorino posted another video on Saturday from the mall showing a different theft incident at a Burberry location.

""Same @TheWestchester mall, different day, different men. This time @Burberry was hit. Crime doesn’t just happen ‘in the city’ or ‘somewhere else.’ It’s getting worse everywhere in NY and everyone is affected when criminals are emboldened by soft-on-crime laws,"" Astorino tweeted.

The White Plains police department said it is aware of both incidents and investigating, according to a Facebook post Saturday . Police said no weapons were used in either incident and no one was injured.

No arrests have been reported.

Brazen shoplifting incidents and smash-and-grabs have been reported at swanky retail stores across the nation, most notably in California over the holiday shopping season.

147,"MSNBC, CNN face gaping holes in primetime after Rachel Maddow, Chris Cuomo sagas leave 9 pm timeslot unstable",Brian Flood,"

Unusual situations with MSNBC and CNN's star anchors have left them with significant holes to fill during one of the most important hours of the day

Rachel Maddow has gone on temporary hiatus at MSNBC, while Chris Cuomo was fired after a series of scandal brought shame to CNN. While the reasons for their absences are quite different, the liberal networks have found themselves in unstable situations without their former 9 p.m. ET mainstays.

""The 9 p.m. hour in all of television is usually a tentpole for the entire primetime lineup. That CNN and MSNBC are both now floundering in that time slot is really a drag on their entire primetime,"" McCall told Fox News Digital.

JIM ACOSTA'S FORAY INTO CNN’S PRIMETIME LINEUP STRUGGLES TO ATTRACT VIEWERS

The 9 p.m. ET hour is historically prime real estate for any network, as cable and broadcast stations both traditionally put some of their most popular programs in the middle of the critical 8-11 p.m. ET window. NBC’s ""Must See TV"" lineup of the 1990s featured ""Seinfeld,"" at 9 p.m., while ""Cheers"" occupied the coveted window before that. ABC’s ""Monday Night Football"" kicked off at 9 p.m. for over three decades and CNN’s ""Larry King Live"" aired at that time during the pre-Jeff Zucker glory days of CNN. The laundry list of prominent shows to occupy the 9 p.m. hour is endless, but it doesn’t include anything airing on CNN or MSNBC in the near future.

""That both CNN and MSNBC are now struggling in a key time slot indicates that both channels not only have weak benches of talent, but that they also failed to plan ahead and have alternative hosts prepared to step up to the plate,"" McCall said.

CNN has experimented with different options at 9 p.m. ET since it was forced to terminate Cuomo last year, but none have been able to find an audience. MSNBC’s 9 p.m. Maddow-sized crater begins on Monday.

Maddow announced last week that she would be off MSNBC for several weeks, taking a hiatus to work on other projects at least until sometime in April. She hinted that other extended absences could be in her future, and it has been reported that she’s looking to scale back her daily program because of professional burnout.

""We’re just taking it one step at a time,"" Maddow told viewers.

Maddow, like Cuomo, is being replaced by a rotating pool of hosts beginning with Ali Velshi. The move puts an unproved primetime host in the middle of ""All in with Chris Hayes"" and ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,"" which were already struggling among the advertiser-coveted demographic.

""The hiatus of Maddow is really a problem for MSNBC because Hayes before 9 p.m. and O'Donnell after 9 p.m. just can't generate sufficient viewership to prop up the evening's audience,"" McCall said.

As for CNN, the liberal network has used Michael Smerconish in Cuomo’s old spot, extended Anderson Cooper’s program and spent two weeks airing poorly rated ""Democracy in Peril,"" specials hosted by Brianna Keilar and Jim Acosta, but none of the options have resonated with Americans.

FACT CHECK: JIM ACOSTA’S CNN SPECIAL DIDN’T REACH ‘MILLIONS AND MILLIONS’ OF PEOPLE DESPITE ON-AIR CLAIM

Since Dec. 6, the first weekday after Cuomo was shown the door, CNN has averaged a dismal 631,000 viewers at 9 p.m. During that same time period, Fox News’ ""Hannity"" averaged 2.8 million and Maddow pulled in 2.1 million for MSNBC.

""CNN's ratings problems are so severe now that it could well take years and a major strategic redirection to recover,"" McCall said.

It’s unclear if Velshi and other MSNBC fill-in hosts will be able to keep the ship afloat, but Maddow has been the network’s most-watched host for years and CNN has shown that viewers don’t stick around when a popular program is replaced with rotating bit players.

Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson feels holes at 9 p.m. are simply the latest signs that liberal networks are having trouble remaining relevant under President Biden.

""CNN and MSNBC built their current brands around hatred of Donald Trump and conspiracy theories of Russia collusion that never held up. Now that Trump no longer is president and Biden is struggling, those networks don't seem to know what they want to be,"" Jacobson told Fox News Digital. ""The loss of two marquee hosts for reasons unrelated to branding makes the identity problem worse.""",https://www.foxnews.com

Canadian police announced Monday that seven people have been arrested and more than 100 have been issued tickets in connection to ""demonstration-related enforcement"" in Ottawa.

This comes after Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon as approximately 500 trucks and vehicles with the ""Freedom Convoy"" continued to linger in the streets of the Canadian capital to protest vaccine mandates and other coronavirus-related restrictions.

Ottawa Police Service issued a warning earlier Monday that ""anyone found bringing fuel to the demonstration trucks in the red zone could be subject to arrest and charges.""

So far, 60 criminal investigations related to the demonstration have been opened, primarily for mischief, thefts, hate crimes and property damage. Confederation Park has been fully cleared and fenced.

Ottawa Police Service has received 100 Ontario Provincial Police officers to assist with demonstrations.

Watson said in a statement Sunday that declaring a state of emergency ""reflects the serious danger and threat to the safety and security of residents posed by the ongoing demonstrations.""

""This is a siege — it is something that is different in our democracy than I’ve ever experienced in my life,"" Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said on Saturday. ""We do not have sufficient resources to adequately and effectively address this situation.""

The ""freedom truck convoy"" has attracted support from many U.S. Republicans including former President Donald Trump, who called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a ""far left lunatic"" who has ""destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates."" Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called the ongoing protest ""an occupation.""

149,Unvaccinated dad loses custody of kids; judge waves away dad's research on jabs,Brie Stimson,"

An unvaccinated father in New Brunswick, Canada, lost custody of his children, including an immunocompromised 10-year-old, after a judge ruled in favor of the mother late last month, according to reports.

The parents, who were not identified in the court ruling, had separated in 2019 but shared custody of their three kids. Last year, the mother asked to have the custody agreement changed because the father and his new wife refuse to be vaccinated and in light of their daughter’s ongoing treatment for non-cancerous tumors in her blood vessels, according to CBC News.

Justice Nathalie Godbout said she made the decision with a ""heavy heart"" but it was necessary for the child’s health amid the coronavirus pandemic and the recent effects of the omicron variant.

The court also ruled that despite the father’s lack of consent, the mother could vaccinate the children.

If the father gets vaccinated he will be allowed to ask the court in an urgent request to regain custody. In the meantime, he can video-chat or talk with his kids on the phone, the court ruled, according to the Canadian Press.

Dad's research dismissed

The judge dismissed the personal research the father said he had done on the efficacy of vaccines.

""His own anecdotal research on such a highly specialized topic carries little to no weight in the overall analysis when measured against the sound medical advice of our public health officials,"" Godbout wrote, according to the CBC.

She added, ""It is no contest: the current science in the face of a highly contagious virus far outweighs Mr. F.'s layman wait-and-see approach.""

No comment was reported from the father.

""This isn't a case where she wants to take the children away from their father,"" the mother’s lawyer, Grant Ogilvie, said after the ruling, according to the CBC. ""This is what's best for the children, period. She's acknowledged this is going to have an impact on the children, but she said, 'I have to do what's best for them.'""

154,Blackburn demands answers regarding reports of Biden's taxpayer-funded crack pipe distribution,Jon Brown,"

FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., sent a letter to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Tuesday expressing her ""grave concerns"" about the department's program that could reportedly use taxpayer money to distribute crack pipes to drug addicts.

The Washington Free Beacon initially reported on the program, noting that the department would prioritize applicants in ""underserved communities"" as defined under one of President Biden's executive orders. An HHS spokesperson reportedly told the Beacon that the grants would fund smoking kits with pipes for users to smoke crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine and ""any illicit substances.""

The grant document references Biden's executive order 13985, titled ""Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.""

CRACK PIPE DISTRIBUTION FUNDED BY HHS, PRIORITIZING ‘UNDERSERVED’ COMMUNITIES: REPORT

""Government-funded drug paraphernalia is a slap in the face to the communities and first responders fighting against drugs flowing into our country from a wide-open southern border,"" Blackburn wrote. ""If this is the president's plan to address drug abuse, our nation is in serious trouble.""

Blackburn gave HHS until March 1 to clarify whether the Biden administration is, in fact, authorizing the distribution of drug paraphernalia, which is in violation of the U.S. Code. The senator also demanded to know which entities applied to the grant program and how such entities are deemed eligible.

An HHS spokesperson described the Beacon's report to Fox News as ""blatant misinformation,"" but did not explicitly deny the report.

""The Harm Reduction Grant offered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and authorized by the American Rescue Plan is a grant program designed to help Americans who are struggling with substance use stay healthy and safe, prevent overdose death, and find pathways into evidence-based treatments,"" the HHS spokesperson said. ""Like all programs that use federal funding, these grants must adhere to relevant federal, state and local laws or regulations.""

155,"Prosecutors reject charges for 5 suspects involved in deadly Chicago shootout, cite mutual combat: Report",Emma Colton,"

Illinois prosecutors rejected charging five suspects in a deadly gang-related shootout that unfolded in Chicago , despite police reportedly seeking to charge all five suspects with murder and aggravated battery.

The shootout took place in the Austin community of Chicago Friday morning, and was reportedly sparked by an internal dispute between two factions of the Four Corner Hustlers gang, the Chicago Sun Times reported , citing an internal police report and a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.

Five men were taken into custody over the shootout, which required a SWAT team response and led to police finding more than 70 shell casings. One shooter was left dead and two of the suspects wounded.

CHICAGO DOORDASHER CARJACKED FOR SECOND TIME FIRES GUN, ENDS UP ARRESTED

The police source told the outlet that law enforcement sought murder and aggravated battery charges for all five suspects.

By Sunday morning, however, they were released without charges.

""Mutual combatants was cited as the reason for the rejection,"" a police report reviewed by the Chicago Sun Times said of the state attorney’s office’s decision. The report also noted that the suspects weren’t cooperating with investigators.

Mutual combat is a legal phrase defined as a ""fight into which both parties enter willingly, or in which two persons, upon a sudden quarrel, and in hot blood, mutually fight upon equal terms.""

Fox News attempted to verify the statement in the police report, but Chicago Police said a FOIA request must be filed to obtain the report. A FOIA request has since been filed.

The Cook County state’s attorney’s office, however, issued a statement that painted a different picture on why the charges were dropped.

Prosecutors had ""determined that the evidence was insufficient to meet our burden of proof to approve felony charges,"" Cristina Villareal, a spokeswoman for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office, said, adding that police agreed with the decision.

The Cook County state’s attorney’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News’s request for comment on the police report citing mutual combat as the reason for the rejection of charges.

DICK DURBIN EXPERIENCES CHICAGO GUN VIOLENCE FIRST-HAND; LIGHTFOOT URGED TO DECLARE ‘PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY'

""It’s just like the Wild West,"" the source told the outlet of the gun crimes on Chicago’s West Side.

A similar ""mutual combat"" incident also reportedly unfolded in Schaumburg, Illinois , last week after an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death in an incident caught on film.

Manuel Porties Jr. died last Tuesday after he met with another teenager for a one-on-one fight, according to his family. Porties Jr. was punched in the face, fell, and then reportedly stabbed in the neck by the 17-year-old.

The 17-year-old was charged with a misdemeanor, and Porties Jr.’s family said prosecutors declined to file a murder charge, citing mutual combat.

""They’re saying that it’s mutual combat,"" Porties Jr.’s father told WGNTV. ""How is it mutual combat when my son didn’t have anything to combat with the only thing he had was his two hands?""

""He stood over my son and finished him, and that’s not murder?"" the father added.

156,Chicago Mayor Lightfoot: Carjacking ‘crisis’ is linked to remote learning,Greg Norman,"

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is suggesting that her city’s dramatic rise in carjackings since the start of the coronavirus pandemic is linked to students being kept away from classrooms with remote learning.

Lightfoot argued in favor of the connection Monday as Chicago announced that it is expanding its vehicular hijacking task force and installing more cameras and license plate readers around the city in hopes of preventing the crimes.

""We are seeing an inordinate number of juveniles that are the perpetrators of these carjackings. I think in Chicago we have consistently seen 50% or higher of the people that we are arresting are juveniles,"" Lightfoot told reporters.

CHICAGO POLICE ARREST 3 TEENAGERS ON CARJACKING CHARGES

""We started seeing this rise in cases in 2020. And I’ll be frank and say in Chicago there was a correlation we believe between remote learning and the rise in carjackings,"" she added. ""Having talked to state attorneys who are dealing with these cases in juvenile court and others, a lot of parents went to work during the day thinking their teenagers were logged on for remote learning, only to find something else. And I ask, ‘Is there some new market for stolen cars?’ And unfortunately the answer was no -- that for many of these kids, some of whom had no prior involvement in the criminal justice system, this was pure boredom.""

Data compiled by CBS Chicago shows that there were 603 carjackings in 2019, before that number rose to 1,413 in 2020 and 1,850 last year.

From the beginning of 2015 until the start of 2020, there were only three months in Chicago where the number of carjackings recorded was 100 or more, the station’s data shows. However, since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been 18 months with 100 or more recorded carjackings.

And there also was an 11-year-old arrested for a carjacking around Thanksgiving last year.

4 TEENS CHARGED IN SERIES OF CHICAGO CARJACKINGS

""No resident in the city of Chicago or the Chicagoland area deserves to live in fear of violence,"" Lightfoot said. ""But the sad reality is that in the last year and a half in particular, there is a very real and pervasive fear of carjacking across our city, our region and our state. And in actuality carjackings have become a national crisis.""

The Chicago Teachers Union – which has repeatedly clashed with Lightfoot and the city over bringing students back into classrooms during the pandemic – described the mayor’s remarks about carjackings and remote learning as ""inflammatory, hurtful smears against our students.""

""Every child in our public schools in Chicago deserves an apology from the mayor today, who claimed with zero evidence that there was a correlation between remote learning in 2020 and an increase in car-jackings, which have been growing across the nation,"" the union said in a statement.

""Is the reason she resisted moving to remote learning during the Omicron surge because her bogus belief in that false correlation has become part of her crime-fighting tactics?"" the statement added.

157,Fentanyl poisoning deaths double in 30 states over 2 years: study,Audrey Conklin,"

Fentanyl poising deaths doubled in 30 states between 2019 and 2021, according to an analysis of U.S. government data.

Five states including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana Mississippi, California and Texas saw a five-fold increase in fentanyl deaths, the analysis from opioid awareness organization Families Against Fentanyl shows.

""The fentanyl crisis is getting worse, not better. Fake pills with deadly amounts of fentanyl are popping up everywhere. It’s in fake Xanax and Percocets, it’s being laced in cocaine and ecstasy. A single pill can kill,"" Families Against Fentanyl founder James Rauh, who lost his son to fentanyl poisoning, said in a Thursday statement.

The synthetic opioid can be deadly even in very small amounts, and other drugs, including heroin, meth and marijuana, can be laced with the dangerous drug. Mexico and China are the primary sources for the flow of fentanyl into the United States, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

CONNECTICUT POLICE SAY 100 BAGS OF FENTANYL FOUND AT DEAD YOUTH'S HOME

""Fentanyl poisoning is tearing families apart and killing our young people at an alarming rate,"" Rauh said. ""This stuff is so deadly it’s been used as a chemical weapon. Even babies and young children have been fatally poisoned by accident. It does not belong on our streets. It’s time for our leaders in Washington to do more.""

DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS, FUELED BY FENTANYL, HIT RECORD HIGH IN U.S.

The 30 states that saw fentanyl deaths doubled — or more-than doubled — over two years include Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana Mississippi, California, Texas, Oregon, Kansas, Idaho, Alabama, New Mexico, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Georgia, Washington, Nevada, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee, Iowa, Indiana, Arkansas,

In 2021, Florida recorded the highest number of total fentanyl poising deaths in the U.S., followed by California, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey.

West Virginia recorded the highest number of fentanyl poisoning deaths per capita last year, followed by Washington, D.C.; Maryland; Delaware; Ohio; Kentucky; Tennessee; Connecticut; Maine and Rhode Island.

TEXAS SEIZED ENOUGH FENTANYL TO KILL 200 MILLION PEOPLE THIS YEAR ALONE, OFFICIALS SAY

Ohio has recorded more fentanyl deaths since 2015 than the 20 states with the fewest fentanyl deaths combined, losing nearly 20,000 people to the dangerous opioid.

Since 2015, Louisiana has seen the most drastic jump — 2,363% — in fentanyl deaths, followed by Arizona (2,172%), California (2,137%), Indiana (1,370%), Minnesota (1,189%) and Washington state (1,169%).

Families Against Fentanyl released an analysis in December 2021 that found fentanyl deaths surged to the No. 1 cause of deaths for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45.

158,"University Of Delaware board members, who are keeping Biden's Senate records secret, have close ties to the former VP",Gregg Re,"

EXCLUSIVE: Numerous top officials on the board of the University of Delaware, which is refusing to release Joe Biden's Senate records despite an earlier promise to do so, have close personal and financial ties to the former vice president, records reviewed by Fox News show -- and the chairman of the board even bought Biden's house in 1996 for $1.2 million, reportedly a ""top dollar"" price given its condition.

The documents suggest a significant conflict of interest as Biden faces increasing pressure to relinquish the documents that could contain information relevant to Tara Reade's sexual assault allegation against him.

Biden dropped off 1,875 boxes of “photographs, documents, videotapes, and files” and 415 gigabytes of electronic records to the University of Delaware in 2012. The university initially said it expected to make the records “available to the public two years after Biden’s last day in elected public office.” In April 2019, just hours before Biden announced his current presidential bid, the university changed its mind, and said the papers wouldn't be released until either December 31, 2019 or until two years after Biden “retires from public life,” whichever comes later.

This week, both The Atlantic and The Washington Post argued that Biden should instruct the university to turn over the records, saying they ""could contain confirmation of any complaint Ms. Reade made, either through official congressional channels or to the three other employees she claims she informed not specifically of the alleged assault but more generally of harassment.""

The University of Delaware’s charter states that the Board of Trustees has “entire control and management of the affairs of the university,"" and notes that no university bylaws ""shall diminish or reduce the Board’s plenary authority over all matters related to the control and management of the affairs of the University.""

The current chairman of the board at the University of Delaware, John Cochran, is a longtime Biden donor and former CEO of credit card giant MBNA.

In a January 1998 article entitled ""The Senator from MBNA,"" columnist Byron York recounted how Cochran, then MBNA's vice chairman, paid ""top dollar"" for Biden's home in February 1996, just prior to his Senate re-election bid, and that ""MBNA gave Cochran a lot of money—$330,000—to help with 'expenses' related to the move.""

The $1.2M sale was a ""pretty darned good deal for Biden,"" York wrote, noting that ""Cochran simply paid Biden’s full asking price"" even though the ""house needed quite a bit of work; contractors and their trucks descended on the house for months after the purchase.""

York noted that nearby houses were selling below their appraised value at the time. “It is customary for appraisers to evaluate homes in relation to similar properties in the area, or ‘comparables,''' York wrote. ""In the case of Biden’s house, the appraiser compared the home to another large old house about a quarter of a mile away. That house—which was in similar condition—was judged to be worth $1,013,000. It sold in August 1995 for $800,000 (it should be noted that the house did not have a pool, which Biden’s does; on the other hand the house had central air conditioning, which Biden’s did not, and it was on a larger lot).""

The appraiser also ""looked at two other newer houses in the area,"" York continued. ""One was appraised at $1,230,000 and sold for $1,007,500. The other was appraised at $1,163,000 and sold for an even $1 million. In all three cases, the homes sold for a good deal less than their appraised value.""

Asked how Cochran and Biden found each other for the sale, an MBNA spokesperson told York: ""That’s a very personal question."" Federal election records also showed top MBNA executives apparently made a ""concerted"" effort to donate to Biden's campaign, York reported.

HUNTER BIDEN SCANDALS EXPLAINED: UKRAINE, COCAINE, AND MORE

Shortly after the house sale, Biden's son Hunter was hired on at MBNA. Rachel Mullen, a former senior personal banking officer at MBNA from 1994-2001 who later went into Republican politics, tweeted that managers referred to the younger Biden as ""Senator MBNA"" after he was hired into a lucrative management-prep track right after he graduated from Yale Law School.

An MBNA source who previously worked at the company told Fox News that other employees heard Biden boasting that his salary was unusually high, even for the management-prep track -- which was widely seen in the company as a way to groom and pamper well-connected executive candidates with powerful family members.

The source said Biden's ""Senator MBNA"" nickname was not politically motivated, but rather reflected a widely held belief among managers -- who did not work directly with Biden -- that he essentially was engaged in lobbying.

As Hunter cashed the checks, Biden was pushing successfully on the Senate floor for legislation that would make it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy protection -- benefiting companies like MBNA. In a contemporaneous interview, Tom Brokaw asked the elder Biden whether it was ""inappropriate"" for the then-senator to have his son ""collecting money from this big credit card company while you were on the [Senate] floor protecting its interests.""

In 2018, Cochran, who has supported each of Biden's political campaigns, joined Biden in attending the naming ceremony of the Biden School of Public Policy at the University of Delaware.

COMPARING THE EVIDENCE: READE'S CASE VS. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S

Further, at least seven other members of the University of Delaware's board of trustees have donated to Biden's political campaigns -- including a former Biden senior counsel from the Senate, as well as the state's governor and other senior officials.

Terri Kelly, the former president and CEO Of W.L. Gore & Associates, has served on the university's board of trustees since 2014 -- and donated the maximum legal amount to Biden in 2019.

Carol Ammon, who has been on the board since 2013, has given more than $10,000 to Biden's campaign and affiliated PACs, federal election records show.

John Paradee, a lawyer, joined the board in 2018. He has also donated heavily to Biden.

John Carney, the state's governor and another board member, has also donated more than $1,000 to Biden.

Claire DeMatteis served as counsel to Biden. Since 2001, she has given over $16,000 to Democratic PACs, including Biden's, called Unite our States.

TIMELINE SHOWS MEDIA, DEMS TREATED KAVANAUGH MATTER VERY DIFFERENTLY

Chai Gadde, a CEO, has donated thousands to Biden.

William Lafferty, a partner at a Delaware law firm who serves on the board as well, has also given more than $2,500 to Biden's campaign.

Despite some outlets calling for the release of the records held by these board members, Senate Democrats and media outlets have been mostly silent on Reade's claims, even though they called for an immediate FBI investigation into claims against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. Reade, however, has presented substantially more corroborating evidence than Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.

Biden himself hasn't addressed the allegation against him, and no one in the media has asked him about it during interviews. Representatives for Biden's campaign have denied the allegations, even as some Democrats have urged Biden to address the matter himself.

Earlier Wednesday, The New York Times rebuked the Biden campaign, telling Fox News that the campaign was apparently circulating talking points to top Democrats that ""inaccurately"" described the paper's reporting. The talking points falsely claimed that the Times had disproven Reade's accusations, when it actually found some corroboration.

Business Insider, The Intercept, and Newsbusters have separately found additional contemporaneous corroboration for Reade's claims, including footage showing Reade's mother calling into ""Larry King Live"" to discuss an incident involving her daughter and a prominent senator.

The Times had earlier stealth-edited its coverage of the Biden accusations at the request of the Biden campaign. The paper specifically removed a section of its reporting referring to numerous other episodes in which Biden was accused of inappropriate touching -- including one instance in which he was caught on camera touching young girls and making them visibly uncomfortable.

""I think that the [Biden] campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct,"" The Times' executive editor, Dean Baquet, admitted the day after the article was published.

According to a copy of the Times' article saved by the Internet archive Wayback Machine, the Times originally reported: ""No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.""

That paragraph now reads: ""No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.""

Baquet also struggled to explain why his paper had waited weeks to even report on Reade's allegations. Baquet implied that Kavanaugh was urgently in the public spotlight, while Biden -- who was locking up the Democratic presidential nomination as Reade's claim surfaced -- somehow was not in the public eye.

""Kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way,"" Baquet said. ""Kavanaugh was in a very different situation. It was a live, ongoing story that had become the biggest political story in the country. It was just a different news judgment moment.""

Biden has previously said he would change his interactions with women going forward, but stopped short of apologizing for his conduct.",https://www.foxnews.com
159,GiveSendGo founder rips 'authoritarian' Big Tech after GoFundMe seizes Canadian trucker's cash,Danielle Wallace,"

After GoFundMe shut down fundraising for the Canadian ""Freedom Convoy,"" donors flocked to Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo to support truckers protesting vaccine mandates in Ottawa.

The founder and CFO of the platform, Jacob Wells, is now calling out GoFundMe and Big Tech for their ""authoritarian style of social platforms,"" which he says promote bias as fact and causes further division.

The campaign ""Freedom Convoy 2022"" has raised nearly $5 million through GiveSendGo as of Monday.

ALASKA ‘FREEDOM CONVOY’ HELD IN SUPPORT OF CANADIAN TRUCKERS' ANTI-MANDATE PROTESTS

""Big Tech really has taken it upon themselves to be the arbiters of truth. And it's a place that they were never intended to be, and it's caused more damage than good,"" Wells told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Monday. ""We are now stepping into that place because there is a natural pushback from many people because America was founded on these ideas of freedom.""

""This is like the tip of the spear and what is coming in a tsunami of technology that is pushing back against this authoritarian style of social platforms where it's like these people just think that they get to control the narrative,"" he said. ""It’s mind-blowing to me that they actually think that is the way that it ought to be, because in my perspective, it only breeds more distrust and more vitriol, more divide.""

GiveSendGo, which launched in 2014, permitted donations for Kyle Rittenhouse’s defense. The fundraiser allowed him to post $2 million bail after GoFundMe had blocked donations. GoFundMe lifted its ban on fundraisers for Rittenhouse following the teenager’s acquittal in November.

""Freedom Convoy 2022"" is the platform's largest fundraiser to date, Wells said.

His remarks come as Ottawa police have been turning up on the heat on demonstrators, making several arrests, ticketing about 500 people and threatening charges for anyone caught providing fuel to truckers. After convincing GoFundMe to shut down the convoy’s campaign last week, Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly warned those financially supporting protesters that police will ""continue to go after the money.""

So far, Ottawa police have opened 60 criminal investigations related to the demonstrations, primarily for mischief, thefts, hate crimes and property damage.

Wells told Fox New Digital he had not been contacted by Canadian authorities directly regarding the new crowdfunding campaign on his platform. He pointed out that the fundraising campaign was created by the organization Freedom 2022 Human Rights, which is a sanctioned Canadian nonprofit, meaning it was cleared by the Canadian government to collect donations for humanitarian relief.

""It's very, very fascinating to me that governments have stepped in to that extent, especially in the Western world, because it goes against everything that we know, which is that our rights don't come from government, they come from God, and that he's given us those,"" Wells said. ""And it's the government's place to ensure security of those rights not to try to take them from us.""

As a military veteran, Wells said governments are making a ""mockery"" of the sacrifices service men and women have made to preserve freedoms by enforcing coronavirus-related mandates.

""I'm a military veteran and I just I know what that sacrifice is, and I'm not going to walk on that lightly,"" Wells said. ""Literally, men and women have given up their lives, their security, they give up their safety and leave everything on the line to see freedom exist in this country and to walk on that to say, ‘Well, I'm going to take that from you.’ That’s such a mockery of those sacrifices.""

""Give Send Go will always stand for freedom for people on either side of our current ideological separation,"" he continued. ""That freedom was first bought at the cross for us. But it was also maintained by the blood of courageous men and women who sacrificed their lives so that we could live in freedom.""

GoFundMe blocked $10 million in donations intended for those participating in the Ottawa protests.

The crowdfunding platform said $1 million was released last week, but funds would no longer be distributed to the Freedom Convoy organizers. The platform said the remaining millions would go to a charity of the organizers’ choosing. But faced with fraud allegation brought by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, GoFundMe quickly changed course and agreed donors would instead be automatically reimbursed.

Wells criticized GoFundMe for allowing fundraisers for 2020’s CHAZ/CHOP protest in Seattle.

""Obviously anybody that's looking at GoFundMe or some of these big tech companies, you can see the bias written all over them,"" Wells said, pointing to the hypocrisy of GoFundMe allowing fundraising for demonstrators who took over the Capitol District in Seattle in 2020. ""These occupations had taken over parts of cities in the United States. So, that bias here is overwhelming.""

Thousands of people have been misplaced from their jobs because they’re being told they can’t work if they don’t get vaccinated, Wells said. So, he says money collected through GiveSendGo allows the Canadian non-profit to address this ""humanitarian crisis"" and is ""not going towards violence.""

""There will always be levels of detractors that try to instigate something,"" Wells said. ""And the opposing forces are going to try to make that the talking point in the narrative. And we're not going to allow that to happen because we know that that isn't the movement that is happening. This is a movement of peace, a movement of standing for their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""",https://www.foxnews.com

161,"Clinton campaign paid to 'infiltrate' Trump Tower, White House servers to link Trump to Russia, Durham finds",Brooke Singman,"

First on Fox: Lawyers for the Clinton campaign paid a technology company to ""infiltrate"" servers belonging to Trump Tower, and later the White House, in order to establish an ""inference"" and ""narrative"" to bring to government agencies linking Donald Trump to Russia, a filing from Special Counsel John Durham found.

Durham filed a motion on Feb. 11 focused on potential conflicts of interest related to the representation of former Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who has been charged with making a false statement to a federal agent. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.

The indictment against Sussmann, says he told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016, less than two months before the 2016 presidential election, that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting in which he presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCS TO DATE: WHAT TO KNOW

But Durham's filing on Feb. 11, in a section titled ""Factual Background,"" reveals that Sussmann ""had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1) at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign.""

Durham’s filing said Sussmann’s ""billing records reflect"" that he ""repeatedly billed the Clinton Campaign for his work on the Russian Bank-1 allegations.""



The filing revealed that Sussmann and the Tech Executive had met and communicated with another law partner, who was serving as General Counsel to the Clinton campaign. Sources told Fox News that lawyer is Marc Elias, who worked at the law firm Perkins Coie.

Durham's filing states that in July 2016, the tech executive worked with Sussmann, a U.S. investigative firm retained by Law Firm 1 on behalf of the Clinton campaign, numerous cyber researchers and employees at multiple internet companies to ""assemble the purported data and white papers.""

""In connection with these efforts, Tech Executive-1 exploited his access to non-public and/or proprietary Internet data,"" the filing states. ""Tech Executive-1 also enlisted the assistance of researchers at a U.S.-based university who were receiving and analyzing large amounts of Internet data in connection with a pending federal government cybersecurity research contract.""

""Tech Executive-1 tasked these researchers to mine Internet data to establish 'an inference' and 'narrative' tying then-candidate Trump to Russia,"" Durham states. ""In doing so, Tech Executive-1 indicated that he was seeking to please certain 'VIPs,' referring to individuals at Law Firm-1 and the Clinton campaign.""

Durham also writes that during Sussmann's trial, the government will establish that among the Internet data Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited was domain name system (DNS) internet traffic pertaining to ""(i) a particular healthcare provider, (ii) Trump Tower, (iii) Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building, and (iv) the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP).""

SPECIAL COUNSEL JOHN DURHAM ‘STILL IN ACTION,’ GARLAND SAYS

Durham states that the internet company that Tech Executive-1 worked for ""had come to access and maintain dedicated servers"" for the Executive Office of the President as ""part of a sensitive arrangement whereby it provided DNS resolution services to the EOP.""

""Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited this arrangement by mining the EOP's DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,"" Durham states.

The filing also reveals that Sussmann provided ""an updated set of allegations"" including the Russian bank data, and additional allegations relating to Trump ""to a second agency of the U.S. government"" in 2017.

Durham says the allegations ""relied, in part, on the purported DNS traffic"" that Tech Executive-1 and others ""had assembled pertaining to Trump Tower, Donald Trump's New York City apartment building, the EOP, and the aforementioned healthcare provider.""

In Sussmann's meeting with the second U.S. government agency, Durham says he ""provided data which he claimed reflected purportedly suspicious DNS lookups by these entities of internet protocol (IP) addresses affiliated with a Russian mobile phone provider,"" and claimed that the lookups ""demonstrated Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations.""

""The Special Counsel's Office has identified no support for these allegations,"" Durham wrote, adding that the ""lookups were far from rare in the United States.""

""For example, the more complete data that Tech Executive-1 and his associates gathered--but did not provide to Agency 2--reflected that between approximately 2014 and 2017, there were a total of more than 3 million lookups of Russian Phone-Prover 1 IP addresses that originated with U.S.-based IP addresses,"" Durham wrote. ""Fewer than 1,000 of these lookups originated with IP addresses affiliated with Trump Tower.""

Durham added that data collected by Tech Executive-1 also found that lookups began as early as 2014, during the Obama administration and years before Trump took office, which he said, is ""another fact which the allegations omitted.""

DURHAM TARGETS CLINTON CAMPAIGN LAW FIRM IN FRESH ROUND OF SUBPOENAS

""In his meeting with Agency-2 employees, the defendant also made a substantially similar false statement as he made to the FBI General Counsel,"" Durham wrote. ""In particular, the defendant asserted that he was not representing a particular client in conveying the above allegations.""

""In truth and in fact, the defendant was representing Tech Executive-1--a fact the defendant subsequently acknowledged under oath in December 2017 testimony before Congress, without identifying the client by name,"" Durham wrote.

Former President Trump reacted to the filing on Saturday evening, saying Durham’s filing ""provides indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia.""

""This is a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate and those who were involved in and knew about this spying operation should be subject to criminal prosecution,"" Trump said. ""In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.""

Trump added: ""In addition, reparations should be paid to those in our country who have been damaged by this.""

Former chief investigator of the Trump-Russia probe for the House Intelligence Committee under then-Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., Kash Patel, said the filing ""definitively shows that the Hillary Clinton campaign directly funded and ordered its lawyers at Perkins Coie to orchestrate a criminal enterprise to fabricate a connection between President Trump and Russia.""

""Per Durham, this arrangement was put in motion in July of 2016, meaning the Hillary Clinton campaign and her lawyers masterminded the most intricate and coordinated conspiracy against Trump when he was both a candidate and later President of the United States while simultaneously perpetuating the bogus Steele Dossier hoax,"" Patel told Fox News, adding that the lawyers worked to ""infiltrate"" Trump Tower and White House servers.

The anti-Trump dossier, authored by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS, was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through Elia's law firm, Perkins Coie.

Patel added that Sussmann relayed the ""false narrative"" to U.S. government agencies ""in the hopes of having them launch investigations of President Trump.""

Sussmann's indictment is the second prosecution to come out of Durham's probe.

In November 2021, Durham also charged Russian national Igor Danchenko of making false statements. Danchenko, who pleaded not guilty, is accused of lying about the source of information that he provided to Christopher Steele for his ""dossier"" on Trump.

In 2020, Durham charged former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith with making a false statement – the first criminal case arising from his probe. Clinesmith was referred for potential prosecution by the Justice Department' s inspector general's office, which conducted its own review of the Russia investigation.

Specifically, the inspector general accused Clinesmith, though not by name, of altering an email about Page to say that he was ""not a source"" for another government agency. Page has said he was a source for the CIA. The DOJ relied on that assertion as it submitted a third and final renewal application in 2017 to eavesdrop on Trump campaign aide Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

Former Attorney General Bill Barr appointed Durham, then the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, in 2019 to investigate the origins of the FBI’s original Russia probe, or Crossfire Hurricane, which began in July 2016, through the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017 shortly after Mueller completed his years long investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded or coordinated with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election.

Mueller's investigation found no evidence of illegal or criminal coordination between Trump or the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016.

Barr, in December 2020, before leaving the Trump administration, tapped Durham as special counsel to continue his investigation through the Biden administration.

In the scope order, Barr stated that Durham ""is authorized to investigate whether any federal official, employee, or any other person or entity violated the law in connection with the intelligence, counter-intelligence, or law-enforcement activities directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns, individuals associated with those campaigns, and individuals associated with the administration of President Donald J. Trump, including but not limited to Crossfire Hurricane and the investigation of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.""

168,"Massive fire rips through North Carolina fertilizer plant, thousands asked to evacuate over explosion fears",Danielle Wallace,"

North Carolina officials are asking thousands living within a one-mile radius of a raging fire at a fertilizer plant in the city of Winston-Salem to evacuate Tuesday amid fears of a large explosion.

The fire started Monday night at Weaver Fertilizer Plant on North Cherry Street, and the City of Winston-Salem officials have confirmed small explosions at the plant.

In the most recent update provided around 9 a.m. Tuesday, Winston-Salem Fire Chief Trey Mayo said an estimated 500 tons of ammonium nitrate was in building, about 100 tons of ammonium nitrate was in an adjacent rail car and about 5,000 tons of finished fertilizer was at the site when it caught fire.

The priority in the daytime was to continue to send drones into the air to monitor the fire and to continue to monitor the air quality outside the one-mile radius from the plant.

BOMB PLOT: NORTH CAROLINA MAN ACCUSED OF TEACHING OTHERS HOW TO MAKE IEDS MEANT FOR KILLING LAW ENFORCEMENT

""We are not out of the woods. We've got about a 36-hour window where explosive potential exists. And we are about 14 hours into that,"" Mayo said.

Matthew Smith, the leader of the on-site hazmat team, said the amount of nitrous gas in the air was not measuring close to what would be considered dangerous to life and health.

Winston-Salem firefighters fought the blaze for about two hours before the fire ""began affecting a rail car"" and at that point ""became an explosive hazard,"" prompting concerns of an explosion of ammonium nitrate, Battalion Chief Patrick Grubbs, a 15-year veteran of the Winston-Salem Fire Department, told reporters at the scene at about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday.

""We're asking everyone to stay out of this area and evacuate the scene,"" Grubbs said, adding that an estimated 6,000 residents lived within a one-mile radius of the plant.

Bright orange flames could be seen shooting into the sky along with thick plumes of smoke as lights from firetrucks and other first responder vehicles surrounded the fully engulfed building.

After those initial two hours, firefighters were pulled out and Emergency Management was called in. They then began accessing the scene every 15-20 minutes using drone teams from other fire departments, Grubbs said. Firefighters could not flow enough volume of water to be reasonably certain that they could keep it cool enough to prevent a detonation.

He said that once a railcar at the rear of the structure had become involved, they were unable to get water to the scene, so they decided to pull away because it had become a large explosive hazard.

As of early Tuesday, water was being pumped at the back of the location from a fire hydrant, Grubbs said.

""Don’t wait for something to happen. Something has happened,"" Mayo had said on Twitter. ""Now is the time to get out.""

According to a Winston-Salem Police Department news release, the 4400 block of Cherry Street from North Point Boulevard to Indiana Avenue was closed while emergency crews, including about 90 firefighters and 150 others from different agencies, responded to the fire around 8:20 p.m. on Monday.

""We won’t be leaving the area anytime soon,"" Grubbs said Tuesday of his fire crews. But he asked that everyone stay out of the area and warned that there was going to be a lot of smoke and poor air quality.

Mayo said Monday evening that fire crews ""abandoned"" the fire-fighting operation because of the large volume of ammonium nitrate on site. The building had collapsed as well, and access to the product in the building was restricted, WGHP-TV reported.

At around 2 a.m. Tuesday, first responders were seen driving through the area asking residents to evacuate to safety as the threat of an explosion still loomed. Grubbs said first responders were also going door-to-door to get people safely away from the area.

""The evacuation area around 4440 North Cherry Street has almost 6,500 residents or 2,497 households,"" the City of Winston-Salem reported on its Twitter page.

Wake Forest University released a statement asking some students in off-campus housing to voluntarily evacuate. The university also said it is working on long-term plans for those who do not have an alternative place to go. The Forsyth Correctional Center is also included in the evacuation area.

Winston-Salem officials said a shelter has been set up at the Winston-Salem Fairgrounds. People who have evacuated should plan to be away from their homes for up to 48 hours.

The fertilizer plant was closed when the fire started and no employees were inside, local media outlets reported. Grubbs said officials from the Weaver Fertilizer Plant have made no comment about the fire.

No injuries have been reported, and the cause of the fire is still under investigation.

169,"BlackRock, other investment firms 'killing the dream' of home ownership, journalist says",Charles Creitz,"

The New York City risk and investment management titan BlackRock is among several high-powered firms pushing working families out of the housing market and into rentals, therefore depriving them of capital and the opportunity to build credit and equity.

According to a Wall Street Journal report, BlackRock – led by billionaire Laurence Fink – is purchasing entire neighborhoods and converting single-family homes into rentals; while in cities like Houston, investors like Fink account for one-quarter of the home purchasers.

On ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Chronicles journalist and associate editor Pedro Gonzalez said that BlackRock's actions are leading 40% of American renters to believe they will never be able to purchase a home.

""Homeownership gives people a stake in a society. It’s a way to build generational wealth. It’s the foundation of the middle-class and part of the American dream,"" he said.

Meanwhile, ""permanent capital,"" like that from firms like Fink's are ""killing the dream and giving us a nightmare of dispossession.""

The impetus for firms to mass-purchase housing is to underwrite pensions and pad their books by spiking housing prices.

170,Last living signer of Canadian constitutional charter of rights sues government over COVID travel ban,Jon Brown,"

The last living drafter and signatory of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is the highest law of the land, is suing the Canadian federal government over its travel ban for the unvaccinated.

Former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Brian Peckford, 79, is the main applicant in a case brought against the federal government by the Calgary-based Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, according to a press release.

""It is becoming more obvious that being vaccinated does not stop people from getting Covid and does not stop them from spreading it,"" the former premier said in a statement. ""The government has not shown that the policy makes flying safer—it simply discriminates.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rolled out one of the world's strictest COVID-19 vaccine mandates last fall. By Oct. 30, employees in all federally regulated industries were required to be vaccinated or face termination. Anyone aged 12 and over who wished to travel by plane, train or ship was also ordered to be vaccinated.

THOUSANDS OF CHURCHES RAISE ALARM ABOUT SCOPE OF NEW CANADIAN ‘CONVERSION THERAPY’ BAN

""When I heard Prime Minister Trudeau call the unvaccinated 'racists,' 'misogynists, 'anti-science' and 'extremist,' and his musing, ‘do we tolerate these people?’ it became clear he is sowing divisions and advancing his vendetta against a specific group of Canadians,"" Peckford continued, referencing a resurfaced interview with Trudeau from September 2021.

""This is completely against the democratic and Canadian values I love about this country,"" he said.

""The federal travel ban has segregated me from other Canadians. It’s discriminatory, violates my Charter rights and that’s why I am fighting the travel ban,"" Peckford added.

The lawsuit alleges violations of Charter rights, including mobility, life, liberty and security of the person, privacy, and discrimination. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was a bill of rights for Canadians entrenched in the Constitution Act, 1982.

CANADIAN PASTOR DEFIANT AS JUDGE ORDERS HIM TO PARROT ‘MEDICAL EXPERTS’ FROM PULPIT: ‘I WILL NOT OBEY’

During an extensive recent interview with Canadian author and professor Jordan Peterson, Peckford laid out the portions of the Charter he helped to draft and that he believes are being violated. He also explained his unique role as the only first minister left alive who was at the conference that helped draft the freedoms enshrined in the document.

""I do this very reluctantly,"" he said. ""I've been watching this thing now for almost two years. I've been speaking out about it at public meetings and on my blog and so on, and I've come to the conclusion now that I must—as a Canadian and as one of the writers and founders of the Constitution Act of 1982—not only speak about it, I must act about it.

""I must show Canadians that I'm so concerned as a citizen, as a former first minister that helped craft this Constitution Act of 1982, that I must take action against my own government. Because they have violated rights that I and others helped craft in 1981 and 1982,"" he added.

174,"Fusion GPS's ties to Clinton campaign, Russia investigation: What to know",Kaitlyn Schallhorn,"

From its connection to Hillary Clinton’s campaign to the publication of a graphic dossier about President Trump, Fusion GPS has become something of a major player in the Russia investigation.

The political firm was behind the controversial dossier that contained numerous colorful but unverifiable allegations about Trump’s connections to Russia. And that dossier got somebody “killed,” according to an attorney for Fusion GPS.

""Somebody’s already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work,” said attorney Joshua Levy in an Aug. 22 deposition made public.

Fusion GPS has been linked to a conservative website as well as the Clintons. Here’s what to know about the firm.

What is Fusion GPS?

Founded by veteran journalists, Fusion GPS “provides premium research, strategic intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law firms and investors worldwide,” according to its sparse website.

The Washington, D.C.-based group says it offers a “cross-disciplinary approach with expertise in media, politics, regulation, national security, and global markets.”

Fusion GPS was started in 2009 by former Wall Street Journal reporters Peter Fritsch and Glenn Simpson.

How is Fusion GPS linked to the Russia investigation?

The political firm was behind the controversial dossier that contained a number of colorful but unverifiable claims about Trump. The company retained British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who produced the 35-page dossier.

While it has not been verified, the dossier, which included explicit sexual and financial allegations against Trump, created further speculation about any Trump connection to Russian officials – a question that has dogged his campaign and presidency.

Simpson told the House Intelligence Committee in November that some information the firm obtained raised questions about the campaign’s involvement with Russians during the election.

""I think that the evidence that has developed over the last year, since President Trump took office, is that there is a well-established pattern of surreptitious contacts that occurred last year that supports the broad allegation of some sort of an undisclosed political or financial relationship between the Trump Organization and people in Russia,"" Simpson said.

The dossier was also the catalyst for a surveillance warrant the FBI and Justice Department obtained to spy on Carter Page, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, according to a controversial memo from the House Intelligence Committee. The memo alleges that officials did not reveal who paid for the dossier when requesting the warrant.

So who funded the dossier?

The firm was originally retained during the election by the conservative website Washington Free Beacon which wanted opposition research on Trump and other GOP candidates.

After Trump became the Republican nominee, Clinton and the Democratic National Committee retained Fusion GPS through lawyer Marc Elias and his firm, Perkins Coie.

Clinton reportedly did not know about the dossier until BuzzFeed News published it in January 2017. Democrats have defended it as simply opposition research.

TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

It's unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time Perkins Coie hired it or how much money was involved in the transaction. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid Perkins Coie more than $9 million – although it’s uncertain how much of that money, if any, went toward the dossier.

The Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the project until October 2016 – right before the election.

Trump has suggested that the dossier was funded by Russia, Democrats or the FBI.

Anything else?

Simpson has done substantial investigative work on the case of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was imprisoned after reporting a massive tax fraud scheme. Magnitsky died in prison, and the U.S. enacted the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on certain Russian officials.

During the campaign, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, took a controversial meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was supposed to have damning information about Clinton. Instead, those who went to the meeting said she just wanted to talk about the Magnitsky Act.

In his investigative work on Magnitsky, Simpson may have found evidence that contradicts details of the case accepted by the U.S., NBC News reported.

Fusion GPS also did work as a firm related to the Magnitsky Act.

The new findings contradict various doubtful media coverage from programs like CBS’ ""60 Minutes.""

Meanwhile, former CNN dynamic duo Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo criticized John Durham and the Trump administration back in December 2019 for being adamant about uncovering the truth, yet coming up short.

""Nothing happens and they just move on to the next conspiracy theory,"" Lemon said to Cuomo during a handover. ""It is never going to end and guess what? People who want to believe that BS are going to believe it.""

In an October 2021 episode of MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" host Rachel Maddow suggested the intention behind efforts to probe the investigation was always to re-route the investigation away from Trump himself.

""It’s a boomerang,"" she said. ""Because it’s apparently an ongoing, concerted Republican and pro-Trump project to try to turn the investigation of the Russia scandal into some kind of scandal itself.""

Since Durham’s bombshell report dropped, media pundits on the left have gone largely quiet. Publications like the Washington Post and The New York Times have failed to commission any coverage of the latest allegations as of Monday, nor has CNN.

Twitter users like author and cartoonist Scott Adams translated the media blackout as if networks like CNN were actively trying to avoid the ""biggest story"" as of current.

The expectation of Russia invading Ukraine is becoming progressively more likely based on recent military patterns, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., analyzed on ""America Reports"" Thursday.

According to Russian military movement and the commencement of drills with Belarus, Cotton anticipated that President Putin has every intention to attack the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv first, pending invasion.

""The sad fact is that Russia has troops encircling Ukraine and they’re exposed on almost every front,"" he said. ""But my estimate based, on the late troops movements into Belarus, is that Vladimir Putin decided that he wanted to get to the capital sooner rather than later.""

TURKEY STEPS UP UKRAINE SUPPORT AS GERMANY REMAINS DISTANT

But the Belarus military drills could be all but a distraction, which has led the senator to believe that an initial invasion of Ukraine could happen in a matter of days.

""Those military drills… are nothing but a cover for a likely invasion,"" Cotton said. ""I think they tell us, since they’re starting so soon, that we could be down to a matter of days, not weeks.""

Cotton advocated for not sending any troops into Ukraine as members of the U.S. military stand by at the Polish border. The senator did, however, share an explicit message for Americans still in Ukraine: Get out now.

""You should leave now,"" he asserted. ""If you do not leave now, you should make a plan to leave by ground to the west into countries like Poland or like Hungary.""

""You should not expect that the American military is going to be able to fly aircraft into Ukraine and help you evacuate after a potential invasion,"" he went on. ""For the sake of safety, I would urge all Americans in Ukraine to leave today.""

The senator also responded to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s expression of ""disappointment"" in diplomatic talks. Cotton boiled down the last few months of diplomacy as ""nothing but a ruse"" to prepare for Ukrainian invasion.

""Regrettably, because of failures of policy and weakness over the last year, as well as Vladimir Putin’s desires, I think the diplomatic route has reached its end.""

Cotton admitted that there’s not much U.S. Congress can do to deter foreign violence this late into the build-up, but he did suggest the deployment of ""stringent"" sanctions on Russia and Belarus.",https://www.foxnews.com
178,"Durham probe has 'accelerated,' with more people 'cooperating,' coming before grand jury",Brooke Singman,"

FIRST ON FOX: Special Counsel John Durham’s investigation has ""accelerated,"" and more people are ""cooperating"" and coming before the federal grand jury than has previously been reported, a source familiar with the probe told Fox News.

The source told Fox News Monday that Durham has run his investigation ""very professionally,"" and, unlike Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, his activities, and witness information and cooperation status are rarely, if ever, leaked.

""Durham does this right and keeps it a secret,"" the source said, adding that there has been ""much more activity"" in Durham’s investigation ""than has been visible to the public.""

CLINTON CAMPAIGN PAID TO 'INFILTRATE' TRUMP TOWER, WHITE HOUSE SERVERS TO LINK TRUMP TO RUSSIA: DURHAM

The closest look Durham has given with regard to grand jury witnesses came in a federal court filing last month, outlining materials that had been provided by the special counsel’s office to defense attorneys for former Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann.

Sussmann has been charged with making a false statement to a federal agent. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.

Durham’s Jan. 25 filing tells the court that the special counsel’s office provided materials, including ""transcripts of sworn grand jury testimony by the following witnesses"" to Sussmann’s team.

Durham does not explicitly include the names of individuals who testified before the grand jury in the filing, but rather, their professional titles, or titles assigned to them by the special counsel’s office.

Durham lists a number of individuals, including ""the above-referenced former FBI General Counsel,"" which could be a reference to James Baker, who served as FBI general counsel from January 2014 until May 2018. Fox News reported in October that Durham had plans to call Baker to testify in the case against Sussmann.

The indictment against Sussmann, says he told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016, less than two months before the 2016 presidential election, that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting in which he presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

Durham's Feb. 11 filing says that the ""FBI General Counsel"" will ""likely be a central witness at trial.""

Baker did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Durham also provided grand jury testimony from ""the above-referenced former FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence."" It is unclear to which official Durham is referring, but the title could be a reference to Bill Priestap, who served as the FBI’s assistant director for counterintelligence from 2015 to 2018.

FORMER DNI RATCLIFFE TOLD DURHAM INTELLIGENCE SUPPORTS ‘MULTIPLE’ INDICTMENTS IN PROBE: SOURCES

Priestap did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Durham also lists ""a former FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Counterintelligence."" It is unclear to whom Durham is referring.

Peter Strzok served as a deputy assistant director for counterintelligence. Three sources familiar with the FBI’s structure told Fox News there could be as many as three individuals serving in the deputy assistant director of counterintelligence role at a time.

Strzok, who was part of the original FBI investigation into whether the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election, and later in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, was fired from the FBI in 2018 after months of scrutiny regarding anti-Trump text messages exchanged with former FBI General Counsel Lisa Page. Their anti-Trump text messages were uncovered by the Justice Department inspector general.

Fox News was unable to reach Strzok for comment.

Durham, in the filing, also lists testimony from ""the attorney previously employed by Law Firm-1 who is referred to in the Indictment as ‘Campaign Lawyer-1.’"" It is unclear to whom Durham is referring.

However, in a separate Durham filing on Feb. 11, the special counsel states that ""Campaign Lawyer-1"" was ""serving as General Counsel to the Clinton Campaign."" Three sources told Fox News that individual is Marc Elias, who served as general counsel to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and worked at the law firm Perkins Coie.

Elias’ law firm, Perkins Coie, is the firm that the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign funded the anti-Trump dossier through. The unverified dossier was authored by ex-British Intelligence agent Christopher Steele and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS.

A spokesperson for Elias did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Durham, in the filing, also lists ""an FBI Special Agent who served as case agent for the FBI’s Russian Bank-1 investigation"" and ""an FBI Headquarters Supervisory Special Agent assigned to the Russian Bank-1 investigation."" Durham also adds ""two current employees of Agency-2;"" ""two current or former employees of University 1;"" and ""a former employee of Internet Company-3.""

A spokesperson for Special Counsel John Durham told Fox News that special counsel's office ""will decline to comment beyond the court filings.""

But a source familiar with federal investigations told Fox News that federal prosecutors cannot indict an individual and then use a grand jury to investigate matters in an existing indictment.

The source, though, said a prosecutor can indict an individual for a specific crime, and continue to use the grand jury to explore other crimes related to that individual, and beyond.

""They are looking at more than Sussmann,"" the source said.

HILLARY CLINTON 2016 TWEETS PUSHED NOW-DEBUNKED CLAIM OF TRUMP USE OF 'COVERT SERVER' LINKED TO RUSSIA

In Durham’s Jan. 25, 2022 filing, he states:

""The Government also maintains an active, ongoing criminal investigation of the defendant’s [Sussmann’s] conduct and other matters,"" Durham wrote.

Meanwhile, Fox News first reported on Durham's Feb. 11 filing, which alleged that lawyers from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016 had paid to infiltrate servers belonging to Trump Tower and later the White House, in order to establish an ""inference"" and ""narrative"" to bring to federal government agencies linking Donald Trump to Russia.

In a section titled ""Factual Background,"" Durham revealed that Sussmann ""had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1) at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign.""

Durham’s filing said Sussmann’s ""billing records reflect"" that he ""repeatedly billed the Clinton Campaign for his work on the Russian Bank-1 allegations.""

The latest filing states that in July 2016, the tech executive worked with Sussmann, a U.S. investigative firm retained by Law Firm 1 on behalf of the Clinton campaign, numerous cyber researchers and employees at multiple internet companies to ""assemble the purported data and white papers.""

""In connection with these efforts, Tech Executive-1 exploited his access to non-public and/or proprietary Internet data,"" the filing states. ""Tech Executive-1 also enlisted the assistance of researchers at a U.S.-based university who were receiving and analyzing large amounts of Internet data in connection with a pending federal government cybersecurity research contract.""

""Tech Executive-1 tasked these researchers to mine Internet data to establish 'an inference' and 'narrative' tying then-candidate Trump to Russia,"" Durham wrote. ""In doing so, Tech Executive-1 indicated that he was seeking to please certain 'VIPs,' referring to individuals at Law Firm-1 and the Clinton campaign.""

Durham also wrote that during Sussmann's trial, the government will establish that among the Internet data Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited was domain name system (DNS) internet traffic pertaining to ""(i) a particular healthcare provider, (ii) Trump Tower, (iii) Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building, and (iv) the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP).""

Durham stated that the internet company that Tech Executive-1 worked for ""had come to access and maintain dedicated servers"" for the Executive Office of the President as ""part of a sensitive arrangement whereby it provided DNS resolution services to the EOP.""

""Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited this arrangement by mining the EOP's DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,"" Durham states.

The filing also reveals that Sussmann provided ""an updated set of allegations"" including the Russian bank data, and additional allegations relating to Trump ""to a second agency of the U.S. government"" in 2017.

Durham says the allegations ""relied, in part, on the purported DNS traffic"" that Tech Executive-1 and others ""had assembled pertaining to Trump Tower, Donald Trump's New York City apartment building, the EOP, and the aforementioned healthcare provider.""

In Sussmann's meeting with the second U.S. government agency, Durham says he ""provided data which he claimed reflected purportedly suspicious DNS lookups by these entities of internet protocol (IP) addresses affiliated with a Russian mobile phone provider,"" and claimed that the lookups ""demonstrated Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations.""

""The Special Counsel's Office has identified no support for these allegations,"" Durham wrote, adding that the ""lookups were far from rare in the United States.""

""For example, the more complete data that Tech Executive-1 and his associates gathered--but did not provide to Agency 2--reflected that between approximately 2014 and 2017, there were a total of more than 3 million lookups of Russian Phone-Prover 1 IP addresses that originated with U.S.-based IP addresses,"" Durham wrote. ""Fewer than 1,000 of these lookups originated with IP addresses affiliated with Trump Tower.""

Durham added that data collected by Tech Executive-1 also found that lookups began as early as 2014, during the Obama administration and years before Trump took office, which he said, is ""another fact which the allegations omitted.""

""In his meeting with Agency-2 employees, the defendant also made a substantially similar false statement as he made to the FBI General Counsel,"" Durham wrote. ""In particular, the defendant asserted that he was not representing a particular client in conveying the above allegations.""

MEDIA HIT WITH BRUTAL REALITY CHECK AFTER DURHAM'S CLINTON CAMPAIGN BOMBSHELL ON RUSSIA, TRUMP

""In truth and in fact, the defendant was representing Tech Executive-1--a fact the defendant subsequently acknowledged under oath in December 2017 testimony before Congress, without identifying the client by name,"" Durham wrote.

At this point, Durham has indicted three people as part of his investigation: Sussmann in September 2021, Igor Danchenko on Nov. 4, 2021 and Kevin Clinesmith in August 2020.

Danchenko was charged with making a false statement and is accused of lying to the FBI about the source of information that he provided to Christopher Steele for the anti-Trump dossier.

Kevin Clinesmith was also charged with making a false statement. Clinesmith had been referred for potential prosecution by the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which conducted its own review of the Russia investigation.

Specifically, the inspector general accused Clinesmith, though not by name, of altering an email about Page to say that he was ""not a source"" for another government agency. Page has said he was a source for the CIA. The DOJ relied on that assertion as it submitted a third and final renewal application in 2017 to eavesdrop on Trump campaign aide Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

Meanwhile, this week, sources told Fox News that former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe met with Durham on multiple occasions and told him there was evidence in intelligence to support the indictments of ""multiple people"" in his investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.

Former President Trump reacted to the filing on Saturday evening, saying Durham’s filing ""provides indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia.""

""This is a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate and those who were involved in and knew about this spying operation should be subject to criminal prosecution,"" Trump said. ""In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death.""",https://www.foxnews.com
179,Virginia police lieutenant fired for donating to Kyle Rittenhouse fundraiser seeking due process,Stephanie Pagones,"

EXCLUSIVE DETAILS: The Virginia police lieutenant who was fired from the department in April after anonymously donating to a fundraiser to benefit Kyle Rittenhouse said his ousting came in only a matter of days, despite that the process typically takes months.

Norfolk Police Lt. William Kelly was only roughly 10 months from being a 20-year veteran of the department, at which point he would have been eligible to have received his retirement savings without a penalty. He was fired from Norfolk Police Department in April, when he was suddenly left desperate to find affordable health insurance for himself, his wife, who is sick with cancer, and their three kids.

""I thought I was a free man in America expressing his personal opinion to somebody, giving some words of encouragement and making a simple donation,"" Kelly said during a Friday morning interview with Fox News.

NORFOLK POLICE LIEUTENANT FIRED FOR DONATING TO RITTENHOUSE’S DEFENSE FUND TELLS HIS STORY

Rittenhouse faces a handful of criminal charges, such as murder and being in possession of a firearm as a minor, after he was accused of fatally shooting two people and wounding a third during riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He has said he fired his weapon while defending himself.

Kelly, 42, said he donated to a GiveSendGo account to benefit Rittenhouse, now 18, at the end of summer 2020. He registered an account using his official police department email, but said his donation was anonymous.

A message included with the donation stated: ""God Bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You’ve done nothing wrong. Every rank-and-file police officer supports you. Don’t be discouraged by actions of the political class of law enforcement leadership.""

Kelly did not place the donation during work hours, he said. He didn’t hear anything about the contribution for months, until the morning of Friday, April 16.

""I was getting ready for work one morning and I got a phone call from a fellow police officer who was working at the central desk,"" he recalled.

His colleague was calling about a report released that morning by The Guardian, which detailed how a ""data breach"" revealed how Kelly, who was a sergeant at the time, was among police officials who had donated to Rittenhouse’s fund.

""I only read the portion that was in relation to me, and I immediately called my boss, let him know what had happened,"" Kelly said.

""I didn't think it was going to be that big of a deal,"" he told Fox News. ""I didn't think that anything I said was egregious. I didn't think that my opinion was outside the realm of normal public discourse. So, I honestly did not think it was going to be a big deal.""

Kelly said he understood why he shouldn’t have used his work email address, but said using the city-issued email address was a ""very common"" practice among police department personnel.

Later that Friday he was interviewed by higher-ranking police officials and provided statements to the Internal Affairs Division, to which Kelly had been assigned.

""I remember asking, before we began the statement, what I was being investigated for. And they told me that it was going to be for using a city email account for personal business. And then later on, they said it could possibly be something about conduct unbecoming,"" he said. ""Being in internal affairs, as a sergeant and as lieutenant, I knew that those weren't things that ended people's careers.""

By midday, he was transferred from the internal affairs to the Third Patrol Division.

""I was told that they had to look out for the department,"" Kelly continued. ""I didn’t object to being transferred – I understand that public perception is very important in the 21st century and public trust is very important.""

Kelly ran into Norfolk Police Chief Larry Boone at work on Friday, after the department’s top cop had been made aware of the matter.

NORFOLK FIRES POLICE LIEUTENANT WHO DONATED TO ACCUSED VIGILANTE KYLE RITTENHOUSE

""He was talking with the city manager on the sidewalk. I greeted him, he called me over, and he just put his hands on my shoulders and didn't say anything for a while,"" Kelly recalled. ""And then, he kind of patted my shoulder with his hand and said, 'Bad. We'll talk later.'""

Kelly began hearing whispers over that weekend about how he might be terminated on Monday. He called Boone sometime between Saturday and Sunday, but the call was sent to voicemail, he said.

""I texted him, I told him that I just wanted to know if I was going to be fired. I told him that if I was going to be fired. ‘I'd like to know if it's going to be immediate or if it's going to be something that affords me the chance to get health insurance. I’ve got family members with some severe illnesses,’"" he continued, as he began to choke up.

Kelly’s wife is undergoing treatment for cancer.

The chief never answered Kelly's messages or returned his call. By that Monday, Kelly was out of a job.

Kelly said he anticipated repercussions, but didn’t expect them to reach the level of termination – or to come as swiftly as they did.

""Being in internal affairs for so long as a sergeant and then again coming back as lieutenant, I knew that Internal Affairs investigations take months and months and months, sometimes over a year,"" he said. ""I know that it takes months and months to go through the administrative process of scrutiny by different departments.""

He further described it as a ""long, drawn-out process."" His attorney, Andrew Protogyrou, a former city council member who has represented other officers in union-related legal matters, added that typical consequences would have been ""at worst, a letter of reprimand.""

""So [I] certainly was not expecting to be fired,"" Kelly continued. ""Certainly, was not expecting to be fired within two working days of discovering the donation.""

The police department did not respond to Fox News’ request seeking comment and additional information regarding the circumstance surrounding Kelly’s dismissal. A spokesperson for the city manager’s office declined to comment.

Kelly, through his attorneys, Protogyrou and Raymond L. Hogge, Jr., filed a grievance with the city on May 7, challenging his termination and seeking reinstatement, back pay, restoration of leave, benefits, seniority and rank as well as the expungement of dismissal and public announcement, the document states.

The grievance argues that his dismissal violated due process and Virginia code that does not allow immediate dismissal. It also violates the ""Virginia Law Enforcement Officers Procedural Guarantee Act,"" which requires certain steps, including the ability to respond to formally alleged charges, to be provided to an officer before he or she is fired.

The termination was based on political affiliation, race and was ""unjustified, excessive, arbitrary and capricious,"" the document further states.

The grievance also features a picture of Chief Boone holding a ""Black Lives Matter"" poster during a protest in the city.

""I engaged in speech which was private and anonymous but became public through no fault of my own, and which, when made public, upset a small number of vocal people for a very short time,"" Kelly said in the grievance. ""The Chief of Police of Norfolk Police Department, in contract, has been permitted to parade through the streets of Norfolk, wearing his Norfolk Police Department uniform, holding a ‘Black Lives Matter’ sign while marking with a crowd protesting against police and law enforcement.""

Since his firing, a GiveSendGo account has been created to benefit the Kelly family.

Regardless of the events of the past year, Kelly said without hesitating that he would return to work if given the chance to do so.

""I love my job, I love law enforcement as a career,"" he said. ""It's part of who I am.""",https://www.foxnews.com

New York City Mayor Eric Adams lashed out at the news media after his trip to meet with lawmakers in Albany and suggested that coverage of him is distorted because he’s a Black man.

""I""m a Black man that’s the mayor but my story is being interpreted by people who don’t look like me,"" Adams said during a press conference on Tuesday. ""We got to be honest about that. How many Blacks are in the editorial boards? How many Blacks determine how these stories are being written? How many Asians? How many east Indians? How many south Asians?

Adams continued, ""My role as mayor is being interpreted through the prisms of your realities and not mine. So when you write stories, you’re not writing stories for people who were almost homeless like me. You’re not writing stories for people who were arrested and beat up by police officers. You’re not writing stories for those who are dealing with high crime. You’re writing them from your prisms.""

Adams said he was not ""saying this to attack"" but his administration is going to be ""about saying the obvious that other people are uncomfortable with saying.""

""Discomfort is growth,"" Adams explained.

Adams then called on the owners of media companies to diversify their newsrooms.

""Diversify your newsrooms so I can look out and see people that look like me and say we are going to write stories based on the prisms that we have,"" Adams said. ""That's not what we're getting and that's why I'm covered the way I'm covered. And I'm not comfortable with it.""

ERIC ADAMS USES RACIAL SLUR IN UNEARTHED 2019 VIDEO ON POLICING

Adams was expressing frustration with media reports that his trip to Albany to meet with New York lawmakers about rolling back the state’s bail reform laws did not go smoothly, including one anonymous source who said Adams got ""beat up"" by lawmakers in the meetings.

""There was no arguing, no yelling, no screaming,"" Adams said. ""Areas we disagreed on we talked about it and we walked through them.""

Adams continued, ""I’m trying to figure out do you guys already write the stories before I do something and just live out what you have already written? I’m going to stop doing off topics because if you already have your perception of me and you’re already going to stick to what you think I am then why am I doing this?""

181,Beto O'Rourke flip-flops again on confiscating AR-15s as polls show him trailing Texas Gov. Abbott,Houston Keene,"

Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke appears to have flip-flopped – again – on confiscating AR-15s, as polls show him trailing behind Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.

The failed senatorial and presidential contender said earlier this week that he has ""no interest in taking"" assault weapons from gun owners.

TEXAS GOVERNOR’S RACE: ABBOTT LEADS O’ROURKE BY 15 POINTS, QUINNIPIAC POLL FINDS

""I’m not interested in taking anything from anyone,"" O’Rourke said to reporters in Tyler, Texas. ""What I want to make sure that we do is defend the Second Amendment. I want to make sure that we protect our fellow Texans far better than we’re doing right now.""

The flip appears to be driven by the polling numbers, and comes just a few months after O’Rourke full-throatedly backed a mandatory buyback for AR-15s and other so-called assault weapons.

""Most of us understand the responsibility that comes with owning a firearm, and we will vigorously protect that Second Amendment right and also protect the lives of those around us,"" he told The Texas Tribune, calling them weapons designed for the battlefield. ""But I think most of us also understand that we should not have military-style weapons used against our fellow Texans. We have four of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history right here in Texas that took place over the last five years.""

O’Rourke has been engaged in an intricate acrobatics routine about the most popular rifle in America since his failed Senate bid in 2018.

The Texas Democrat made headlines in 2019 after saying, ""Hell yes,"" he would take people’s AR-15s away if elected president while gunning for the Democratic presidential nomination.

O’Rourke’s enthusiastic backing of the government taking away certain firearms from Americans was in stark contrast to his 2018 stance.

""We support the Second Amendment, if you own a gun keep that gun, O’Rourke said in 2018. ""No one wants to take it away from you, at least I don’t.""

Texas has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the U.S., and the Second Amendment voters are some of the most active in the nation.

When asked if the latest flip-flop was due to polling numbers and if O’Rourke could clarify his stance on the issue, the Democrats’ campaign pointed to his campaign website .

""And while it might not be the easy or politically safe thing to say, I strongly believe that we need to reduce the number of AR-15’s and AK-47’s on our streets,"" the website reads. ""When a gunman drove to a Walmart in my hometown of El Paso and managed to kill nearly two dozen of my neighbors with an AK-47 in under three minutes, it made it all too clear to me that it is far too easy for Texans to get their hands on weapons of war that are designed specifically to kill people in masses in as little time as possible.""

Since leaving the House to challenge Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for his seat in 2018, O’Rourke’s political career has steadily shifted from public-office holder to perennial candidate.

O’Rourke lost to Cruz in 2018 before launching his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, which he did not achieve.

His presidential bid sputtered in the primary as he took his signature, radical stance on gun confiscation and now-President Biden took the nomination.

Often times, presidential primary candidates are chosen for Cabinet positions or administrative roles — something the Biden administration passed him over for entirely, illustrating O’Rourke’s politically toxic image.

182,Tulsi Gabbard: Durham findings shows mainstream media worked 'to undermine democracy',Hanna Panreck,"

Former Democratic Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said Tuesday that the recent findings from the John Durham investigation into the origins of the Russia probe show that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media worked to ""undermine our democracy.""

""The Durham investigation has shown that the biggest threat to our democracy is not some foreign country, but rather the Power Elite led by the likes of Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators in the mainstream media & security states who work to undermine our democracy from within,"" Gabbard tweeted early Tuesday morning.

‘60 MINUTES,’ CNN, MSNBC, DOWNPLAYED, CRITICIZED DURHAM PROBE OF RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

Gabbard's comment echoed the sentiment of an earlier tweet in which she said, ""Clinton and her warmongers must be held accountable.""

TULSI GABBARD KNOCKS BIDEN ADMIN AS ‘AUTHORITARIAN’ AND ‘UNACCEPTABLE’

Fox News first reported that Special counsel John Durham, who was appointed by former Attorney General William Barr in 2020, filed a motion on Feb. 11 concentrating on possible conflicts of interest connected to Michael Sussman. Sussman, a former Clinton campaign lawyer who was charged with allegedly lying to the FBI, pled not guilty to the charges in September 2021.

The Feb. 11 filing alleged that Clinton's campaign lawyers paid a technology company to get access to Trump Tower servers to create a ""narrative"" that would link former President Donald Trump to Russia.

Sussman's indictment says he told James Baker, who was the FBI General Counsel at the time, that he was not doing work for ""any client"" in September 2016. He had allegedly held a meeting where he presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between Alfa Bank, which has Russian ties, and the Trump organization, according to previous reporting.

NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER DEFLECTS FROM DURHAM PROBE DEVELOPMENTS BY REFUELING RUSSIAN COLLUSION NARRATIVE

Sussman ""assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1) at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign,"" the filing says, according to Fox News.

Durhams findings also allege Sussman ""repeatedly"" billed the Clinton Campaign for the ""work on the Russian Bank-1 allegations.""

White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Perrie did not answer questions about the Durham findings during Monday's press conference.

""I can't speak to that report,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""I refer you to the Department of Justice.""

An operator of a limousine company was indicted Friday on 40 felony counts for a deadly crash in New York state that killed 20 people last year.

Nauman Hussain, who ran the Prestige Limousine company with his father, was charged with 20 counts of manslaughter in the second degree for each victim and 19 more counts of criminally negligent homicide were added to single count he was already facing, the Albany Times Union reported.

NEW YORK CRASH VICTIM TEXT MESSAGED THAT LIMO WAS IN 'TERRIBLE CONDITION' BEFORE ACCIDENT KILLED 20

The grand jury handed up the indictment after deliberating all day in the Schoharie County Court’s basement, six months after Hussain, 29, was first charged in the investigation’s early stages, the paper reported.

Hussain's defense attorney, Lee Kindlon, told Rochester's Democrat & Chronicle that his client was “not guilty of criminal wrongdoing” and called the indictment “flawed.”

""We will fight for him every step of the way,"" Kindlon said.

Hussain was expected to plead not guilty at his arraignment scheduled for Wednesday.

Prestige Limousine rented out the 2001 Ford Excursion limo on Oct. 6, 2018, to a group of 17 friends who were planning to celebrate a birthday at a brewery in Cooperstown.

Trump Media & Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes said Wednesday on ""America's Newsroom"" he hopes John Durham's probe will hold people accountable for their actions during the 2016 campaign. Nunes said what Durham is finding shows the need for an investigation into how Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe was conducted.

SUSSMANN ATTORNEY'S FILING RESPONDING TO DURHAM ALLEGATIONS: READ IT HERE

DEVIN NUNES: When I asked Mueller directly when he was presenting to the United States Congress what he knew about Christopher Steele and the dossier he didn't remember. So look, I don't know if he had cognitive issues at that time, but the whole Mueller investigation should be investigated, and I hope that Durham is looking at that because you had all kinds of Clinton campaign operatives and dirty cops who were in that Mueller probe. So totally different from what you have with Durham. Oh, and by the way, you went every single day with a leak. Let's not forget the leaks to the fake news who were promoting this hoax. The Durham probe has been the opposite of that. He's doing it by the book. There's been zero leaks. So I think Durham has a lot of credibility moving forward here. The issue will be, is some of the laws that were broken weren't crimes. And that's really the problem. If an FBI lawyer lies to a FISA court, you know, nobody ever thought that was there's not really a law on the books for that. That should be like 20 years minimum sentence because we can't have dirty cops, people within these intelligence agencies playing politics and lying to a court. But however, they got a slap on the wrist. So I think Durham's building a larger conspiracy case here and hopefully he's going to be able to get build enough evidence to bring all of these people to justice.

CNN is apparently so baffled by the popularity of Joe Rogan that it sought out an ""expert"" to help explain why the podcast giant has such a huge following.

In a video report released by CNN Business on Wednesday, a reporter began by accusing Rogan of using his platform on Spotify ""to make false and inaccurate statements about COVID-19 and vaccines,"" adding that he ""has also used raced and offensive language.""

CNN ANCHOR ADMITS SHE'S ‘OFFICIALLY OUT OF IDEAS’ FOR ‘WHAT TO DO ABOUT JOE ROGAN’

""Even with these controversies, Rogan remains wildly popular. So the question is- why?"" the unnamed CNN Business reporter asked.

The report then introduced Gabriel Wisnewski-Parks, a research fellow at UNC Greensboro who CNN Business says has ""studied Rogan's appeal.""

Wisnewski-Parks, who claims to have watched ""hundreds of hours"" of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" told CNN Business, ""What makes him so magnetic to his audience is his very vocal resistance to tribalism,"" citing Rogan's wide-ranging guests from conservative commentator Ben Shapiro and Info Wars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on the right and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and progressive icon Cornel West on the left, saying ""this really resonates with people.""

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER ROASTED FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT AMERICANS TRUSTING JOE ROGAN OVER HIS OWN NETWORK

""One other connection we can make that I don't think should be overestimated is Joe Rogan's background as a stand-up comedian, this archetype of the comedian as the truth-teller,"" Wisnewski-Parks said.

The so-called Rogan ""researcher"" suspected his apologies for the various uproars has made him ""even more ""credible to his fans, saying that the ""learning"" the podcast host admits he needs is ""relatable.""

""Joe Rogan's podcast absolutely has the potential to be dangerous, especially when we're talking about… communication over a public health issue,"" Wisnewski-Parks said. ""But it can be just as dangerous if we're going to start censoring because we need to figure out how to keep open those lines of communication in a way that is both critical and willing to question Joe Rogan's authority but at the same time recognizes that his appeal and his popularity are already entrenched in his audience. And that's not going anywhere.""

JOE ROGAN TORCHES CNN'S BRIAN STELTER: ‘HEY MOTHERF---ER, YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE A JOURNALIST'

CNN shared the report on Twitter, writing ""Joe Rogan is one of the most popular podcast hosts in the world, despite a series of controversies. CNN Business spoke with a researcher who has studied his appeal to explain why his audience loves him.""

Critics blasted the liberal network for having to rely on an outside resource to crack the mystery of Rogan's popularity.

""CNN had to find an outside expert to explain how you would produce programming that attracts an audience,"" National Review senior writer Dan McLaughlin reacted.

JOE ROGAN FORCES DR. SANJAY GUPTA TO ADMIT CNN SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED HIS COVID TREATMENT ‘HORSE DEWORMER’

""I may or may not have laughed out loud at the fact CNN had to bring in a third party expert to explain ratings and consumer interests,"" Washington Examiner's Becket Adams tweeted.

""CNN requiring expert help to understand why anyone listens to the world’s most popular podcaster is painfully on-brand,"" political commentator Drew Holden quipped.

""Someone unironically researched 'Joe Rogan's appeal,' and someone at CNN greenlighted this segment. It's not possible to mock this any more than it mocks itself,"" Daily Wire writer Virginia Kruta tweeted.

187,"Defendant gets 40 years, blames gender identity struggle for fatal stabbings of parents",Dom Calicchio,"

A defendant convicted in the Halloween 2016 stabbing deaths of her parents -- and who later killed the family pet to keep it from barking -- was sentenced Tuesday to 40 years in prison.

Andrea Balcer, who turned 20 Monday, was 17 at the time of the slayings. She told authorities she ""snapped"" and killed her parents because of her struggle with gender identity. She was born Andrew T. Balcer but now identifies as a woman, CentralMaine.com reported.

At her sentencing hearing, Balcer asked her remaining family members to forgive her -- but many of them called for Balcer to receive the maximum penalty.

""I do not speak today to beg for lenience or to try to save myself from due punishment. I'm here only to ask for one thing, the forgiveness of my family,"" she said.

""I do not speak today to beg for lenience or to try to save myself from due punishment. I'm here only to ask for one thing, the forgiveness of my family."" — Andrea Balcer, sentenced in Halloween 2016 stabbing deaths of parents

Balcer used a hunting knife to stab her mother nine times in the back about 1 a.m. Oct. 31, 2016, authorities said. She stabbed her father after he came to the bedroom to investigate his wife's screams, CentralMaine.com reported.

He was later found dead on the kitchen floor after leaving a trail of blood from the bedroom, the report said.

Balcer later killed the family's pet Chihuahua to stop it from barking, authorities said. An older brother managed to escape the house unharmed.

A defense attorney argued that at the time of the killings Balcer was grappling with a transition from male to female in isolation and without family support. She had no criminal record before the attacks in Winthrop, about 84 miles southwest of Bangor.

The older brother, Christopher Balcer, said the defendant's excuses were ""flimsy"" and urged the judge to be firm.

""In my view, all leniency does is put a remorseless murderer back on the street,"" he said.

""In my view, all leniency does is put a remorseless murderer back on the street."" — Christopher Balcer, brother of defendant

Family and friends testified that the parents, Alice and Antonio Balcer, loving and supportive to both of their children.

Carl Pierce, Alice's brother, said the suggestion that gender identity, abuse or lack of family support played a role was an ""insult to our family, an insult to our society and an insult to the LGBTQ community.""

""There was no hatred. There was no malice. There was no ill will. There was resignation to be sure but ultimately there was acceptance,"" he said.

Despite being a teenager at the time of the crimes, Balcer was treated as an adult in court proceedings, and she pleaded guilty under an agreement that capped her sentence at 55 years.

Justice Daniel Billings found mitigating factors including Balcer's lack of criminal record, her good grades, her age and her acceptance of responsibility by pleading guilty.

But the judge declined to take into account her struggles with gender identity in imposing the sentence. The judge said other transgender people struggle with societal and family acceptance, and that it shouldn't be used as an excuse for her actions.

193,Bob Saget's autopsy report reveals multiple head fractures usually seen in 'high force injuries',Amy Mcgorry,"

Questions surrounding Bob Saget’s cause of death increased after the late comedian's autopsy report revealed Saget suffered injuries to his head that are usually seen from a more traumatic blow than one typically sustains from a slip and fall, according to multiple media reports.

As reported by Fox News last week, Saget’s family released a statement that said the 65-year-old comedian’s sudden death was caused by a brain bleed that occurred after Saget hit his head and went to sleep, not realizing the severity of his injury. The actor was found dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando on January 9th after performing a comedy show in Orlando, Florida, according to the Fox News report.

Health experts weighed in on the autopsy report questioning the investigation and cause of the blow to the comedian’s head that led to his death, according to an article in the Daily Mail.

The outlet posted the autopsy report, which said Saget suffered multiple fractures stretching from the back to the front of the skull and along the eye sockets. It also revealed there was bleeding across both sides of his brain. The Daily Mail cited one report in which a doctor said the injuries in the autopsy appeared consistent with a blow to the skull with a baseball bat or falling 20 to 30 feet.

BOB SAGET'S SHOCKING DEATH HIGHLIGHTS THE DANGERS OF HEAD INJURY

Fox News spoke with Dr. Fred Davis, an Associate Chair of Emergency Medicine at Northwell Health in New York, about the recent questions surrounding the severity of Saget’s injuries.

Davis, an emergency department physician and Assistant Professor at Hofstra University, on Long Island, N.Y., was not involved in Saget’s case, but told Fox News on Sunday, ""The extent of injuries as reported by the autopsy is usually seen in significant traumatic events. It involved breaks in the bones of the skull in multiple areas which tends to happen with high force injuries.""

The growing belief that Saget’s injuries are from something more than a fall had experts weighing in on various media outlets. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office, which headed the investigation into Saget’s death, took to social media to address the concerns.

BOB SAGET WAS BELOVED BECAUSE HE PLAYED THE AMERICAN EVERYMAN

The Orange County Sheriff’s Office posted on its Twitter account a link to a media interview with Sheriff John Mina, of the Orange County Sheriff’s office, who was part of the investigation and discussed Saget’s injuries.

In the interview, Mina said that although the injuries were severe, there were no signs of struggle and said, ""We do not believe he was struck by anything."" Mina also said that Saget’s injuries were likely from a fall where he hit the back of his head on a flat surface, such as a bathroom floor. The autopsy report also revealed that the comedian tested positive for COVID, though the officer and the autopsy report did not say COVID played a role in the comedian’s death.

Forensic scientists told Fox News that investigations such as Saget’s are complex and involve a collaborative effort between the medical examiner, law enforcement investigators, forensic investigators including crime scene and crime lab officials, and the district attorney. They told Fox that investigative hypotheses are typically formed while the influx of substantiated evidence will prove or disprove the hypotheses.

194,UK inspectors find book calling for gays to be executed in Islamic boarding school's library,Emma Colton,"

A Muslim boarding school in the United Kingdom failed a government inspection after a book calling for gay people to be killed was found in its library.

""Participants of the homosexual act should be slained whether they are married or unmarried,"" the book ""Islam on Homosexuality"" states, according to inspectors with the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted).

The book was found in the Institute of Islamic Education in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire , and included ""sections on punishment of individuals because of their sexuality and views which contradict the rule of law,"" according to inspectors.

The book also states that ""the evil doers should be put to death.""

The headteacher of the boys school told inspectors that the book should not have been in the library, but other school leaders said it was for ""research"" purposes, the Daily Mail reported.

""The school does not meet the requirements of the schedule to the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 ('the independent school standards'), the national minimum standards for boarding schools and associated requirements that were checked during this inspection,"" Ofsted inspectors wrote in their report.

The failing grade means the school must make improvements before the next full inspection, which usually takes place within three years after the failing grade is issued .

Ofsted’s report sparked criticism of the school and the book, with the National Secular Society's head of policy and research, Megan Manson, calling the situation ""horrifying.""

""It is appalling that a book calling for gay people to be executed could be found in a school library,"" Manson said, according to the Daily Mail.

""It is even more disturbing that some school leaders appeared to defend the school's decision to make this book available to children.""

The school was previously criticized in 2016 after an investigation found students were forbidden to watch television, read newspapers or listen to music. The school, however, has previously received a ""good"" grade from Ofsted.

The Institute of Islamic Education told Fox News that ""the majority of the areas for improvement identified have now been rectified, and trustees, leaders and staff at the Institute are continuing to work with rigour, diligence and integrity to ensure that all appropriate standards have been met.""

""The Institute’s full and unequivocal commitment to fundamental British values has been reaffirmed, and all books in its library are now consistent with these values,"" the school's statement added.",https://www.foxnews.com
195,"Quintez Brown, Louisville BLM activist charged with attempted murder of mayoral candidate, has troubled past",Jessica Chasmar,"

The Black Lives Matter activist who was charged in Monday’s targeted shooting of Louisville, Kentucky, mayoral candidate Craig Greenberg was previously the subject of a missing person investigation that called into question his mental health.

Quintez Brown, 21, was charged with attempted murder and four counts of wanton endangerment after he entered Greenberg’s campaign headquarters in Butchertown and fired multiple shots using a 9mm Glock handgun, police said. Nobody was hurt, but Greenberg’s shirt was grazed by a bullet, police said.

LOUISVILLE ACTIVIST ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER OF MAYORAL CANDIDATE PUSHED SOCIALISM, GUN CONTROL

Greenberg is a White, Jewish Democrat, and police have not provided details about the possible motive for the shooting but said they are looking at all angles.

Brown previously worked for the Louisville Courier Journal as an intern and an editorial columnist, according to the newspaper. He shared a short campaign video on Twitter in December announcing that he was running to represent District 5 for Louisville’s Metro Council in 2022.

Brown made headlines last summer after he went missing for about two weeks. His family was critical of the Louisville Metro Police Department during the investigation and said police were ""ill-equipped"" in helping to locate Brown. His parents told local media at the time that their son could possibly be going through a mental health crisis and pleaded with the public to help find him. Brown was later found safe in New York.

Brown’s family later said in a July 1 statement issued by Black Lives Matter Louisville that they were privately addressing his ""physical, mental and spiritual health.""

Before the missing person episode, Brown was a prominent activist during the Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police unrest following the May 2020 death of George Floyd.

In July 2020, as a student at the University of Louisville, Brown was honored by the Obama Foundation’s MBK Rising initiative and was one of only a handful of students in the country to attend the inaugural national gathering of the Obama Foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance.

""I better my community for the boys that look just like me by changing the narrative around violence, masculinity, and professionalism,"" Brown said in a statement still featured on the foundation’s website.

Brown told local media around the same time that he demonstrated in Louisville ""every day"" during the Floyd unrest, and he cheered local efforts to remove police officers from schools.

Brown told Louisville Magazine in March 2021, just months before his disappearance, that defunding the police means exactly that: ""We want to take money away from the police.""

""We want to see less officers. We want to see less money in their budget,"" he told the magazine. ""You can’t reform that institution. Defunding the police is our first step toward dismantling everything that was rooted in slavery. Because they’re the original slave catchers. When Black people try to liberate themselves and become free, you had the police to stop them and put them back in their place. So defunding the police to me means kind of like funding our revolution by defunding our oppression.""

During the same interview, Brown said that ""even the most progressive Democratic leaders"" are complicit in systemic racism, adding, ""we’re really at war"" with the establishment.

Last month, Brown wrote a Medium post touting communism and revolution.

""The revolutionary consciousness of the masses must understand that the struggle against the negative forces of genocide and fascism will not end at the ballot box of the ruling class,"" he wrote. ""Attempting to get within one of the two major parties has caused our leaders to become co-opted with their interests shunted to the background. They have become expendable.""

Brown pleaded not guilty at an arraignment Tuesday and his bond was set at $100,000. During the arraignment, his lawyer said Brown would undergo a psychiatric evaluation, The Associated Press reported.

196,Canada's House of Commons erupts after Trudeau accuses Jewish MP of supporting swastikas,Jon Brown,"

The Canadian House of Commons erupted in shouts of condemnation Wednesday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau replied to a Jewish member of Parliament by accusing members of the opposing Conservative Party of ""standing with people who wave swastikas.""

Trudeau, a member of the Liberal Party, made his comment in response to being grilled by Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman during a tense, emotional Question Period, which occurs every sitting day in the Canadian House of Commons when members of Parliament ask questions of government ministers, including the prime minister.

Lantsman, who became the first Jewish woman to be elected as a Conservative MP last October, read a 2015 quote from Trudeau when he said, ""If Canadians are going to trust their government, their government needs to trust Canadians.""

Lantsman contrasted such a sentiment with Trudeau characterizing members of the Freedom Convoy as ""very often misogynistic, racist, women-haters, science-deniers, the fringe."" Accusing him of fanning ""the flames of an unjustified national emergency,"" Lantsman demanded to know ""When did the prime minister lose his way?""

""Conservative Party members can stand with people who wave swastikas, they can stand with people who wave the Confederate flag,"" Trudeau said in response. ""We will choose to stand with Canadians who deserve to be able to get to their jobs, to be able to get their lives back. These illegal protests need to stop, and they will.""

VIGILS PLANNED AT CANADIAN CONSULATES IN US TO PROTEST IMPRISONMENT OF PASTOR WHO PREACHED TO FREEDOM CONVOY

The other side of chamber erupted in response, prompting Speaker of the House of Commons Anthony Rota to interrupt in an attempt to restore order. He also admonished all — ""including the Right Honourable prime minister"" — to avoid ""inflammatory"" language in the House.

MP Dane Lloyd later rose to rebuke Trudeau for his comment, saying, ""Mr. Speaker, I've never seen such shameful and dishonorable remarks coming from this prime minister. My great-grandfather flew over 30 missions over Nazi Germany. My great-great-uncle's body lies at the bottom of the English Channel. There are members of this Conservative caucus who are the descendants of victims of the Holocaust.

""For the prime minister to accuse any colleague in this House of standing with a swastika is shameful. I'm giving the prime minister an opportunity. I'm calling on him to unreservedly apologize for this shameful remark,"" he added.

Trudeau ignored Lloyd's demand for an apology three times, which Lloyd said ""speaks volumes.""

CANADIAN TRUCKERS REACT TO TRUDEAU INVOKING EMERGENCIES ACT: ‘HE JUST GAINED MORE FREEDOM FIGHTERS’

Lantsman later introduced a point of order demanding a personal apology from Trudeau.

""I am a strong Jewish woman and a member of this House and a descendant of Holocaust survivors and … it's never been singled out, and I've never been made to feel less,"" she said. ""Except for today, when the prime minister accused me of standing with swastikas. I think he owes me an apology. I'd like an apology and I think he owes an apology to all members of this House.""

Lantsman's point of order was met with applause, by which time Trudeau had already left the chamber.

197,FBI raids home of Project Veritas' James O'Keefe as part of investigation into Ashley Biden's 'stolen' diary,Joseph Wulfsohn,"

The FBI raided the home of Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe as part of a federal investigation into the ""stolen"" diary of President Biden's daughter, Ashley Biden.

The New York Times reported the raid took place early Saturday morning just days after the homes of two Project Veritas associates were also the subject of search warrants.

A spokesman for the FBI told the Times its agents had ""performed law enforcement activity"" at his apartment building in Mamaroneck, New York, but did not comment on the investigation.

JAMES O'KEEFE ADDRESSES FBI RAIDS OF PROJECT VERITAS REPORTERS OVER BIDEN DAUGHTER'S ‘STOLEN’ DIARY

The investigation is being conducted by the FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan.

Project Veritas responded to a Fox News inquiry by pointing to video remarks O'Keefe released Friday reacting to the previous FBI raids of his journalists

The investigation surrounds a ""stolen"" diary belonging to Ashley Biden that went missing just days before the 2020 presidential election.

O'Keefe confirmed the Times' previous reporting about two other FBI raids that took place this week, releasing a video message addressing his group's apparent ties to the diary and declaring ""Project Veritas came under attack.""

""I woke to the news that apartments and homes of Project Veritas journalists, or former journalists, had been raided by FBI agents,"" O'Keefe began. ""It appears the Southern District of New York now has journalists in their sights for the supposed crime of doing their jobs lawfully and honestly, or at least this journalist.""

JAMES O'KEEFE FIRES BACK AT NEW YORK TIMES OVER ‘HIT PIECE’ ON PROJECT VERITAS

O'Keefe alleged that ""within an hour"" of the FBI's raid of the home of a Project Veritas reporter, the Times contacted that reporter for comment.

""We do not know how the New York Times was aware of the execution of a search warrant at our reporter's home or the subject matter of the search warrant as a grand jury investigation is secret,"" O'Keefe said. ""The FBI took materials of current, former Project Veritas journalists despite the fact that our legal team previously contacted the Department of Justice and voluntarily conveyed unassailable facts that demonstrate Project Veritas' lack of involvement in criminal activity, and or criminal intent.""

""Our efforts were the stuff of responsible ethical journalism, and we are in no doubt that Project Veritas acted properly at each and every step,"" O'Keefe asserted.

The Project Veritas founder then explained that ""tipsters"" approached his group late last year alleging to have Ashley Biden's diary containing ""explosive allegations"" about her father, then the Democratic nominee, and that the diary was allegedly abandoned in a room that she had stayed at and that they stayed after.

The ""tipsters,"" who O'Keefe said he had never met prior, were apparently negotiating with media outlets to sell Biden's diary and that ultimately, Project Veritas did not publish the book's contents because his group was not able to independently verify its authenticity.

O'KEEFE: ‘MORE TO COME’ AFTER PROJECT VERITAS RELEASE S DOCS REVEALING FACEBOOK CENSORING ‘VACCINE HESITANCY’

""Project Veritas gave the diary to law enforcement to ensure it could be returned to its rightful owner. We never published it,"" O'Keefe said. ""Now, Ms. Biden's father's Department of Justice, specifically the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, appears to be investigating the situation, claiming the diary was stolen. We don't know if it was but it begs the question: In what world is the alleged theft of a diary investigated by the President's FBI and his Department of Justice? A diary?""

O'Keefe went on to claim the investigation ""smacks of politics"" but that Project Veritas will ""not back down.""

Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett appeared on ""Hannity"" Friday and stressed there's a ""huge difference"" between what Ashley Biden's attorney has alleged that her diary was stolen versus what O'Keefe alleged about it being left behind in a room, saying ""one's a crime and the other one isn't.""

""Project Veritas did the right thing,"" Jarrett told Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""They didn't publish this because they couldn't verify the authenticity of the documents, but the other conservative website did publish it but they claimed they did verify it. What is so bewildering about this is why in the world would the feds even involved in it.""

Jarrett insisted that even if the diary was the subject of a theft, it would be a ""state crime"" rather than a federal crime and that the investigation, which allegedly began under Attorney General William Barr, has become an ""enormous conflict of interest"" with President Biden now in office.

""A journalist cannot be criminally prosecuted for publishing stolen material unless the journalist himself or herself is involved in the theft. There's no indication of that,"" Jarrett said. ""And the same is true of leaked classified information. Journalists have never been prosecuted for that, although the leakers have when they're identified. So we don't know a whole lot about this story, but it's deeply troubling. They would barge into the homes of two journalists armed with a search warrant signed off by a federal judge and the Department of Justice, presided over by Joe Biden, this smacks of a political investigation and potential prosecution.""",https://www.foxnews.com

199,Clinton campaign lawyer Sussmann files motion to dismiss Durham prosecution,Brooke Singman,"

Attorneys for Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann filed a motion Thursday to dismiss the case against him in Special Counsel John Durham's investigation, claiming a case of ""extraordinary prosecutorial overreach.""

Sussmann asserts in the motion to dismiss that the Durham indictment ""fail[s] to state an offense."" He has been charged with making a false statement to a federal agent, and has pleaded not guilty.

Durham's indictment alleges that Sussmann told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016, less than two months before the 2016 presidential election, that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting in which he presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

But in the motion to dismiss Thursday, Sussmann’s legal team insisted that he ""did not make any false statement to the FBI."" The attorney added that the false statement alleged in the indictment is ""about an entirely ancillary matter,"" and ""immaterial as a matter of law.""

HAWLEY: BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS IMPLICATED IN DURHAM PROBE MUST RECUSE THEMSELVES

""It has long been a crime to make a false statement to the government. But the law criminalizes only false statements that are material—false statements that matter because they can actually affect a specific decision of the government,"" the lawyers wrote, adding that, by contrast, false statements ""about ancillary matters"" are ""immaterial and cannot give rise to criminal liability.""

""Accordingly, where individuals have been prosecuted for providing tips to government investigators, they have historically been charged with making a false statement only where the tip itself was alleged to be false, because that is the only statement that could affect the specific decision to commence an investigation,"" the lawyers wrote. ""Indeed, the defense is aware of no case in which an individual has provided a tip to the government and has been charged with making any false statement other than providing a false tip. But that is exactly what has happened here.""

The lawyers argued that Sussmann ""voluntarily"" met with the FBI in the fall of 2016 to ""pass along information that raised national security concerns.""

FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDE PAPADOPOULOS SLAMS ORIGINAL RUSSIA PROBE AS ‘MASTER CLASS IN DECEPTION’

""He met with the FBI, in other words, to provide a tip,"" Sussmann’s lawyers wrote. ""There is no allegation in the indictment that the tip he provided was false. And there is no allegation that he believed the tip he provided was false. Rather, Mr. Sussmann has been charged with making a false statement about an entirely ancillary matter—about who his client may have been when he met with the FBI—which is a fact that even the Special Counsel’s own Indictment fails to allege had any effect on the FBI’s decision to open an investigation.""

""Allowing this case to go forward would risk criminalizing ordinary conduct, raise First Amendment concerns, dissuade honest citizens from coming forward with tips, and chill the advocacy of lawyers who interact with the government,"" his lawyers argued.

""The Special Counsel’s unprecedented and unlawful overreach should not be countenanced, and the single count against Mr. Sussmann should be dismissed,"" they added.

On Feb. 11, Durham filed a motion focused on potential conflicts of interest related to the representation of Sussmann.

Durham alleged that Sussmann provided two U.S. government agencies with information from tech executive Rodney Joffe that attempted to tie Donald Trump, who was a candidate at the time, to Russia-based Alfa Bank. Joffe is not named in the filing but identified himself in a statement. He has not been charged with a crime.

Joffe and his team ""exploited"" internet traffic pertaining to a ""particular healthcare provider,"" Trump Tower, Trump’s Central Park West apartment building, and the Executive Office of the President of the United States in order to ""establish ‘an inference’ and ‘narrative’"" to then bring to federal government agencies tying Trump to Russia, Durham alleged.

Durham’s Feb. 11 filing said Sussmann’s ""billing records reflect"" that he ""repeatedly billed the Clinton Campaign for his work"" on the Alfa Bank allegations.

Sussmann and his legal team, on Monday, though, demanded that the court ""strike"" portions of Durham’s filing, arguing it will ""taint the jury pool.""

""Unfortunately, the Special Counsel has done more than simply file a document identifying potential conflicts of interest,"" Sussmann’s attorneys wrote. ""Rather, the Special Counsel has again made a filing in this case that unnecessarily includes prejudicial—and false—allegations that are irrelevant to his Motion and to the charged offense, and are plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool.""

The ""factual background"" section of Durham’s filing alleged that Sussmann and the Tech Executive had met and communicated with another law partner, who was serving as general counsel to the Clinton campaign. Sources told Fox News that lawyer is Marc Elias, who worked at the law firm Perkins Coie.

Durham states that the internet company that Joffe worked for ""had come to access and maintain dedicated servers"" for the Executive Office of the President as ""part of a sensitive arrangement whereby it provided DNS resolution services to the EOP.""

""Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited this arrangement by mining the EOP's DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,"" Durham states.

A spokesperson for Tech Executive-1, Joffe, defended his work on Tuesday.

""Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to the Trump campaign and the EOP, respected cyber-security researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings, which was subsequently shared with the CIA,"" Joffe’s spokesperson said.

In Sussmann's meeting with the second U.S. government agency, Durham says he ""provided data which he claimed reflected purportedly suspicious DNS lookups by these entities of internet protocol (IP) addresses affiliated with a Russian mobile phone provider,"" and claimed that the lookups ""demonstrated Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations.""

""The Special Counsel's Office has identified no support for these allegations,"" Durham wrote, adding that the ""lookups were far from rare in the United States.""

""For example, the more complete data that Tech Executive-1 and his associates gathered--but did not provide to Agency 2--reflected that between approximately 2014 and 2017, there were a total of more than 3 million lookups of Russian Phone-Prover 1 IP addresses that originated with U.S.-based IP addresses,"" Durham wrote. ""Fewer than 1,000 of these lookups originated with IP addresses affiliated with Trump Tower.""

Durham added that data collected by Joffe also found that lookups began as early as 2014, during the Obama administration and years before Trump took office, which he said, is ""another fact which the allegations omitted.""

""In his meeting with Agency-2 employees, the defendant also made a substantially similar false statement as he made to the FBI General Counsel,"" Durham wrote. ""In particular, the defendant asserted that he was not representing a particular client in conveying the above allegations.""

""In truth and in fact, the defendant was representing Tech Executive-1--a fact the defendant subsequently acknowledged under oath in December 2017 testimony before Congress, without identifying the client by name,"" Durham wrote.

A spokesperson for the CIA did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Durham has indicted three people as part of his investigation: Sussmann in September 2021, Igor Danchenko on Nov. 4, 2021 and Kevin Clinesmith in August 2020.

Danchenko was charged with making a false statement and is accused of lying to the FBI about the source of information that he provided to Christopher Steele for the anti-Trump dossier.

Kevin Clinesmith was also charged with making a false statement. Clinesmith had been referred for potential prosecution by the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which conducted its own review of the Russia investigation.

Specifically, the inspector general accused Clinesmith, though not by name, of altering an email about Page to say that he was ""not a source"" for another government agency.

Trenga announced at a hearing in the Eastern District of Virginia court that Danchenko's trial is scheduled for Oct. 11, 2022.

SOURCE OF STEELE DOSSIER WAS INVESTIGATED BY FBI FOR RUSSIAN CONTACTS, BARR SAYS

Special Counsel John Durham had brought up concerns about a possible conflict of interest because lawyers associated with Danchenko’s defense teams have also represented Hillary Clinton in the past.

During questioning by Trenga, Danchenko said his lawyers had advised him on the matter, he understood the nature of the conflict and he had ""absolutely not"" been influenced by anyone.

Trenga also said he had reviewed a waiver from Danchenko's defense team on the issue of a possible conflict of interest and was satisfied that the lawyers can continue to defend their client in this case.

Danchenko is charged with five counts of providing false statements to the FBI for allegedly lying about the source of information that he provided to Steele for the dossier on then-candidate Trump.

DURHAM PROBE EXPOSES CLINTON CAMPAIGN TIES TO STEELE DOSSIER

According to the indictment, in March, May, June, October and November of 2017, Danchenko made false statements regarding the sources of certain information that he provided to a U.K. investigative firm that was then included in reports prepared by the U.K. investigative firm and subsequently passed to the FBI.

The indictment stemmed from the investigation of Durham, who has been probing the origins of the Russia investigation, which was initiated by the FBI before being taken over by then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Danchenko pleaded not guilty in federal court in November. The case against him came after Durham in October indicted Clinton lawyer Michael Sussmann for making a false statement. The indictment in that case alleges that Sussmann told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016 that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting in which he presented data and evidence of a purported secret communications channel between then-candidate Trump and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

The indictment against Sussmann says he lied to Baker when he presented data linking the Trump Organization to a secret server that communicated with Alfa Bank. The indictment indicates Durham may be expanding his investigation to bring separate charges again Sussmann or additional defendants.

Bolden created a firestorm after telling Al Jazeera last month that President Obama told him before he took the job that he wanted him to do three things: inspire children to learn math and science, expand international relationships and ""perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science ... and math and engineering.""

Officials from the White House and NASA on Tuesday stood by Bolden's statement that part of his mission is to improve relations with Muslim countries -- though NASA backed off the claim that such international diplomacy is Bolden's ""foremost"" responsibility.

Griffin said Tuesday that collaboration with other countries, including Muslim nations, is welcome and should be encouraged -- but that it would be a mistake to prioritize that over NASA's ""fundamental mission"" of space exploration.

""If by doing great things, people are inspired, well then that's wonderful,"" Griffin said. ""If you get it in the wrong order ... it becomes an empty shell.""

Griffin added: ""That is exactly what is in danger of happening.""

He also said that while welcome, Muslim-nation cooperation is not vital for U.S. advancements in space exploration.

""There is no technology they have that we need,"" Griffin said.

The former administrator stressed that any criticism should be directed at Obama, not Bolden, since NASA merely carries out policy.

The White House stood by Bolden on Tuesday. Spokesman Nick Shapiro said in a written statement to FoxNews.com that Obama ""wants NASA to engage with the world's best scientists and engineers as we work together to push the boundaries of exploration.

""Meeting that mandate requires NASA to partner with countries around the world like Russia and Japan, as well as collaboration with Israel and with many Muslim-majority countries. The space race began as a global competition, but, today, it is a global collaboration,"" he said.

Bob Jacobs, NASA's assistant administrator for public affairs, echoed that point. However, he said that Bolden was speaking of priorities when it came to ""outreach"" and not about NASA's primary missions of ""science, aeronautics and space exploration."" He said the ""core mission"" is exploration and that it was unfortunate Bolden's comments are now being viewed through a ""partisan prism.""

Though the Al Jazeera interview drew widespread attention, it wasn't the first time Bolden made the assertion.

A Feb. 16 blog in the Orlando Sentinel reported that Bolden discussed the outreach during a lecture to engineering students. As he did in the interview with Al Jazeera last month, Bolden was quoted then saying Obama told him to ""find ways to reach out to dominantly Muslim countries.""

He reportedly talked about the importance of helping countries establish space programs and pointed to the largest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia, as a possible partner.

""We really like Indonesia because the State Department, the Department of Education (and) other agencies in the U.S. are reaching out to Indonesia as the largest Muslim nation in the world,"" he said.

Bolden did not describe such outreach as his prime mission at the time.

The NASA administrator was in the Middle East last month marking the one-year anniversary since Obama delivered an address to Muslim nations in Cairo. Bolden spoke in June at the American University in Cairo, and in the interview with Al Jazeera he described space travel as an international collaboration of which Muslim nations must be a part.

""It is a matter of trying to reach out and get the best of all worlds, if you will, and there is much to be gained by drawing in the contributions that are possible from the Muslim (nations),"" he said.

He held up the International Space Station as a model, praising the contributions there from the Russians and the Chinese.

However, Bolden denied the suggestion that he was on a diplomatic mission. ""Not at all. It's not a diplomatic anything,"" he said.

He also said the United States is not going to travel beyond low-Earth orbit on its own and that no country is going to make it to Mars without international help.

Griffin disputed this point. He said the U.S. can still make those strides without international aid if it wishes, and that, ""To the extent that we wish to go to Mars, we can go to Mars.""

Griffin said the U.S. should in fact seek international cooperation for those missions, but that it would be ""clearly false"" to suggest the U.S. needs that cooperation.

Bolden has faced criticism this year for overseeing the cancellation of the agency's Constellation program, which was building new rockets and spaceships capable of returning astronauts to the moon. Stressing the importance of international cooperation in future missions, Bolden told Al Jazeera that the moon, Mars and asteroids are still planned destinations for NASA.

A disgraced Louisiana teacher has pleaded guilty to ""horrific crimes"" against children and admitted to serving her students cupcakes that contained sperm from her ex-husband, who is awaiting his own trial on child sex crime charges, according to authorities.

Cynthia Perkins, 36, agreed to plead guilty and testify against her ex, 44-year-old former Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office SWAT member Dennis Perkins, who is also charged with dozens of child sex crimes, according to prosecutors.

""She not only waived any right to appeal, and attempt to avoid conviction, but she also spared the victims from reliving her horrific crimes during this particular trial,"" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said Monday. ""Today’s conviction is in the best interest of our victims and justice.""

LOUISIANA SHERIFF'S DEPUTY, JUNIOR HIGH TEACHER WIFE HELD ON CHILD RAPE AND PORN CHARGES

Cynthia Perkins was a junior high English teacher until she resigned after police raided the couple’s home. The Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office immediately fired Dennis Perkins, who had been a special operations lieutenant.

Investigators said they received a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children about the Denham Springs couple in 2019. Police seized photographs of the couple posing nude with a child, as well as other evidence while serving a search warrant in October of that year.

Court documents reported by WBRZ in May revealed that police also found pictures of Perkins’ students eating the semen-laced cupcakes and that the couple allegedly raped a child between the ages of 9 and 10. Investigators allegedly found hidden cameras in their attic and bathroom and said they uncovered more pictures on an iPhone.

The couple had initially been charged with 60 counts of production of child porn, rape and other crimes. Prosecutors also accused Dennis Perkins of obscenity, video voyeurism and possessing child porn.

Livingston Sheriff Jason Ard said at the time that although Perkins had been a longtime officer who he considered a friend, ""no one is above the law.""

""This type of alleged behavior will not be tolerated by me or anyone at the LPSO,"" he said.

206,"Durham says 'no basis' to strike 'factual background' from filing, denies intent to 'politicize' Sussmann case",Brooke Singman,"

Special Counsel John Durham on Thursday said that there is ""no basis"" to ""strike"" any part of his recent filing, despite a motion from Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann to do so.

Durham pushed back against claims that his office ""intentionally sought to politicize"" the case, and instead, defended the ""additional factual detail"" he included, which he argued is ""central to proving"" Sussmann's ""alleged criminal conduct.""

Sussmann’s legal team on Tuesday filed a motion demanding that the court ""strike"" portions of Durham’s Feb. 11 filing, including the section titled ""Factual Background,"" claiming the sections would ""taint"" the jury pool.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN LAWYER SUSSMANN ASKS COURT TO 'STRIKE' DURHAM'S 'FACTUAL BACKGROUND' FROM LATEST FILING

Durham, in a new filing Thursday night, urged the court to ""deny the defendant’s motion.""

""As an initial matter, defense counsel has presumed the Government’s bad faith and asserts the Special Counsel’s Office intentionally sought to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool,"" Durham’s filing states.

""That is simply not true,"" Durham states, noting that his Feb. 11 filing ""included two paragraphs of limited additional factual detail in its Motion for valid and straightforward reasons.""

""First, those paragraphs reflect conduct that is intertwined with, and part of, events that are central to proving the defendant’s alleged criminal conduct,"" Durham wrote.

""Second, the Government included these paragraphs to apprise the Court of the factual basis for one of the potential conflicts described in the Government’s Motion, namely, that a member of the defense team was working for the Executive Office of the President of the United States (""EOP"") during relevant events that involved the EOP,"" Durham wrote.

Durham added: ""If third parties or members of the media have overstated, understated, or otherwise misinterpreted facts contained in the Government’s Motion, that does not in any way undermine the valid reasons for the Government’s inclusion of this information.""

""In light of the above, there is no basis to strike any portion of the Government’s Motion,"" Durham wrote, adding that the government intends to file motions in which it will ""further discuss these and other pertinent facts to explain why they constitute relevant and admissible evidence at trial.""

Durham, in the Feb. 11 filing, which was focused on identifying a conflict of interest regarding a lawyer for Sussmann, revealed that his office had learned that a member of Sussmann’s defense ""previously worked as Special Counsel to the then-FBI Director from 2013 to 2014.""

""In connection with that work, Defense Team Member-1 developed professional and/or personal relationships with several individuals who later were involved with and/or knowledgeable of the FBI’s investigation of the Russian Bank-1 allegations,"" Durham wrote in the Feb. 11 filing, adding that following his employment at the FBI, Defense Team Member-1 worked from ""2014 to early 2017 as an attorney in the EOP which, as noted above, was involved in certain factual issues that the Government expects will be relevant at trial and any sentencing proceedings.""

Sussmann has been charged with making a false statement as part of Durham's investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.

Durham's indictment alleges that Sussmann told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016, less than two months before the 2016 presidential election, that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting in which he presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN LAWYER SUSSMANN FILES MOTION TO DISMISS DURHAM PROSECUTION

Durham, in his filing on Feb. 11, under the ""Factual Background"" section that Sussmann and his legal team have asked the Court to ""strike,"" alleged that Sussmann provided two U.S. government agencies with information from a tech executive that attempted to tie Donald Trump, who was a presidential candidate at the time, to Russia-based Alfa Bank.

The tech executive has since identified himself as Rodney Joffe. Joffe is not named in Durham’s filing, and has not been charged with a crime.

In that section of Durham’s filing, he alleged that Sussmann, Joffe and Joffe’s associates ""exploited"" internet traffic pertaining to a ""particular healthcare provider,"" Trump Tower, Trump’s Central Park West apartment building, and the Executive Office of the President of the United States in order to ""establish ‘an inference’ and ‘narrative’"" to then bring to federal government agencies tying Trump to Russia.

In the filing, Durham said Sussmann’s ""billing records reflect"" that he ""repeatedly billed the Clinton Campaign for his work"" on the Alfa Bank allegations.

Earlier in the week, Sussmann’s legal team said Durham had ""done more than simply file a document identifying potential conflicts of interest.""

""Rather, the Special Counsel has again made a filing in this case that unnecessarily includes prejudicial—and false—allegations that are irrelevant to his Motion and to the charged offense, and are plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool,"" Sussmann’s lawyers said.

Further, Sussmann’s legal team on Thursday filed a motion to dismiss the case against him altogether. Durham’s filing Thursday night was not in response to the motion to dismiss the case against Sussmann, but the initial motion earlier in the week to ""strike"" the ""factual background"" from his filing.

The ""factual background"" section of Durham’s filing alleged that Sussmann and the tech executive had met and communicated with another law partner, who was serving as general counsel to the Clinton campaign. Sources told Fox News that lawyer is Marc Elias, who worked at the law firm Perkins Coie.

Durham states that the internet company that Joffe worked for ""had come to access and maintain dedicated servers"" for the Executive Office of the President as ""part of a sensitive arrangement whereby it provided DNS resolution services to the EOP.""

""Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited this arrangement by mining the EOP's DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,"" Durham states.

A spokesperson for Tech Executive-1, Joffe, defended his work on Tuesday.

""Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to the Trump campaign and the EOP, respected cyber-security researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings, which was subsequently shared with the CIA,"" Joffe’s spokesperson said.

In Sussmann's meeting with the second U.S. government agency, Durham says he ""provided data which he claimed reflected purportedly suspicious DNS lookups by these entities of internet protocol (IP) addresses affiliated with a Russian mobile phone provider,"" and claimed that the lookups ""demonstrated Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations.""

""The Special Counsel's Office has identified no support for these allegations,"" Durham wrote, adding that the ""lookups were far from rare in the United States.""

""For example, the more complete data that Tech Executive-1 and his associates gathered--but did not provide to Agency 2--reflected that between approximately 2014 and 2017, there were a total of more than 3 million lookups of Russian Phone-Prover 1 IP addresses that originated with U.S.-based IP addresses,"" Durham wrote. ""Fewer than 1,000 of these lookups originated with IP addresses affiliated with Trump Tower.""

Durham added that data collected by Joffe also found that lookups began as early as 2014, during the Obama administration and years before Trump took office, which he said, is ""another fact which the allegations omitted.""

""In his meeting with Agency-2 employees, the defendant also made a substantially similar false statement as he made to the FBI General Counsel,"" Durham wrote. ""In particular, the defendant asserted that he was not representing a particular client in conveying the above allegations.""

""In truth and in fact, the defendant was representing Tech Executive-1--a fact the defendant subsequently acknowledged under oath in December 2017 testimony before Congress, without identifying the client by name,"" Durham wrote.

A spokesperson for the CIA did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Meanwhile, in Sussmann's Thursday motion to have the case dismissed altogether, his legal team claimed a case of ""extraordinary prosecutorial overreach.""

Sussmann’s legal team insisted that he ""did not make any false statement to the FBI."" The attorney added that the false statement alleged in the indictment is ""about an entirely ancillary matter,"" and ""immaterial as a matter of law.""

""It has long been a crime to make a false statement to the government. But the law criminalizes only false statements that are material—false statements that matter because they can actually affect a specific decision of the government,"" the lawyers wrote, adding that, by contrast, false statements ""about ancillary matters"" are ""immaterial and cannot give rise to criminal liability.""

""Accordingly, where individuals have been prosecuted for providing tips to government investigators, they have historically been charged with making a false statement only where the tip itself was alleged to be false, because that is the only statement that could affect the specific decision to commence an investigation,"" the lawyers wrote. ""Indeed, the defense is aware of no case in which an individual has provided a tip to the government and has been charged with making any false statement other than providing a false tip. But that is exactly what has happened here.""

The lawyers argued that Sussmann ""voluntarily"" met with the FBI in the fall of 2016 to ""pass along information that raised national security concerns.""

""He met with the FBI, in other words, to provide a tip,"" Sussmann’s lawyers wrote. ""There is no allegation in the indictment that the tip he provided was false. And there is no allegation that he believed the tip he provided was false. Rather, Mr. Sussmann has been charged with making a false statement about an entirely ancillary matter—about who his client may have been when he met with the FBI—which is a fact that even the Special Counsel’s own Indictment fails to allege had any effect on the FBI’s decision to open an investigation.""

""Allowing this case to go forward would risk criminalizing ordinary conduct, raise First Amendment concerns, dissuade honest citizens from coming forward with tips, and chill the advocacy of lawyers who interact with the government,"" his lawyers argued.

""The Special Counsel’s unprecedented and unlawful overreach should not be countenanced, and the single count against Mr. Sussmann should be dismissed,"" they added.

207,New Mexico latest state to face legal action over race-based COVID treatments,Timothy Nerozzi,"

FIRST ON FOX: New Mexico is facing possible legal action from an organization that aims to overturn the state's controversial health care rationing policies, which allegedly uses skin color as a basis to decide whether to provide treatment.

America First Legal, a conservative group, has issued a warning to the state of New Mexico to cease all discriminatory practices regarding COVID-19 health care. The legal group has threatened with a lawsuit if the state does not comply.

""We sent a legal warning and letter of potential legal action to the state of New Mexico, who has likewise issued discriminatory COVID-rationing policies. This is something that is a core mission of ours,"" said Stephen Miller, former adviser to President Trump and director at America First Legal Fund.

TUCKER CARLSON: IT'S TERRIFYING THAT AMERICANS ARE BEING DENIED COVID TREATMENT BASED ON RACE

New Mexico's policy is not a new one — the same race-based care rationing has been implemented and overturned in Minnesota, New York and elsewhere.

""[New York] issued a decree rationing COVID medicine on the basis of race, where two people otherwise medically identical, but one was Caucasian and one was not, the Caucasian would not be able to access the medical treatment,"" Miller said. ""This is unthinkable in America.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a recommendation for race-based rationing earlier this month, writing, ""Race and ethnicity are risk markers for other underlying conditions that affect health, including socioeconomic status, access to health care, and exposure to the virus related to occupation, e.g., frontline, essential, and critical infrastructure workers.""

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance stating ""other medical conditions or factors (for example, race or ethnicity) may also place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19"" and may make individuals more eligible for monoclonal antibody treatments.

""The medical establishment in our country has embraced a lot of really wild, far-left theories – the wildest of them being the notion that racial discrimination is a positive good,"" Miller told Fox News Digital.

The New Mexico Office of Health Equity is the state's official department dedicated to outlining and recommending health care policy.

""Health equity is achieved when everyone in our society has the same opportunity to be as healthy as possible, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, economic status, or geographic location,"" the New Mexico Office of Health Equity states. ""New Mexico’s minority-majority population has suffered root shock, historical trauma and the effects of colonization leading to systemic racism and social injustices.""

Miller attributed this racial categorization for health care to what he said is a larger, interconnected problem in state bureaucracies. He asserted that the policies and ideologies behind racial health care rationing are amplified and reinforced in academia.

""The left, over time, has made a concerted effort to occupy career slots in bureaucracies,"" Miller told Fox News Digital. ""You have this mutually reinforcing system whereby the schools that churn out the degrees that people take with them into the bureaucracy are likewise supporters of, and enthusiastic enactors of these policies.""

Minnesota recently removed race as a preferential factor regarding which COVID-19 patients will receive monoclonal antibody treatment, after receiving backlash.

Following controversy, the state's rationing guidance was updated to offer priority for such infusions to people who are immunocompromised or pregnant, but did away with a scoring system that took race into account, according to the Star Tribune .",https://www.foxnews.com

Allies of the 30-member alliance are reportedly worried that Russia could exploit the president’s absence as tension in Eastern Europe has reached a boiling point not seen in decades.

STATE DEPARTMENT CALLS EVACUATIONS IN EASTERN UKRAINE 'FALSE FLAG OPERATIONS,' WARNS OF DISTRACTIONS

Zelensky, who is set to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday, is expected to be a key target if Russia does successfully invade Kyiv, sources confirmed.

Zelensky's office confirmed his plans to attend the Munich conference early Saturday but said he will return to Ukraine hours later, according to Reuters.

President Biden said Friday he is ""convinced"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine.

In answer to questions from reporters as to whether he believed it would be a mistake for Zelensky to leave Ukraine at this time Biden said, ""It may not be…the wise choice, but it's his decision.""

""That's a judgment for him to make,"" Biden said. ""It's in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution.""

A senior U.S. defense official told Fox News Digital there is a strong possibility of a ""significant invasion"" by the Russian military in the coming days and Kyiv is its sites.

The official said Russian military forces have left their barracks and that roughly 40-50% of Putin's troops have moved into attack positions — putting them within striking distance of the Ukrainian border.

Putin now has 120-125 Battalion Tactical Groups amassed along Ukraine's border. All Special Forces have been mobilized, and rocket forces along with ballistic missile units are within range of the capital.

Destabilization efforts that the U.S. and NATO have warned against ""has begun,"" the senior U.S. defense official said.

Tensions in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have clashed with the Ukrainian military since 2014, mounted this week and resulted in an exchange of artillery shelling that began Thursday.

Ukrainian officials and Russian-backed separatists have blamed each other for the attacks.

The separatists Saturday declared a full military mobilization a day after women and children in the region had begun evacuating to southern Russia.

NATO allies are concerned Russia will use the violence there as a pretense to invade Ukraine.

210,"Attractive people have better immune systems, study says",Julia Musto,"

There are associations between facial attractiveness and immune function, according to researchers.

In a study published Wednesday in the academic journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, a team from Texas Christian University looked at 159 participants who were students at the university or members of the surrounding community.

WOMEN WITH SEVERE ENDOMETRIOSIS MAY BE MORE ATTRACTIVE

The men and women were screened in advance to ensure that they were without a history of mental illness or chronic depression, non-obese, free from acute illnesses, not using hormonal contraceptives, willing to abstain from steroidal and anti-inflammatory medications, exercise and alcohol consumption for two days prior to participation and willing to fast the morning of participation.

All women subjects participated when their sex steroid levels are low during the early follicular phase of their ovulatory cycle and participants were asked to have their photos taken and blood tested.

They also responded to compliance questions on the day of participation and removed any make-up before taking a picture from the neck up. They were instructed to maintain a neutral facial expression.

Then, their height and weight were measured and 85 milliliters of blood was collected, as well as plasma that was frozen at minus 80 degrees Celsius.

A separate tube of whole blood was taken for hematology – the study of blood and blood disorders.

In ""Phase II,"" 482 participants were recruited via Amazon's Medical Turk survey hosting platform to rate the subjects' facial attractiveness. Seven photos were excluded due to technical errors and 152 photographs were included in Phase II.

The researchers then collated the ratings and cross-examined them with the results of the blood tests.

10 PROVEN BENEFITS OF LOOKING YOUR BEST

Results revealed that attractive targets had higher rates of phagocytosis – where a cell uses its plasma membrane to ingest foreign particles – of E. coli bioparticles, higher basophil white blood cell counts, lower neutrophil white blood cell counts, greater natural killer cell cytotoxicity and slower rates of Staphylococcus aureus growth in plasma. The effect was stronger in women than in men.

Literature, the authors wrote, revealed that facial attractiveness is ""often consistent across time and space.""

""Features such as clear skin, prominent cheekbones, bright eyes and full, red lips have been deemed attractive throughout recorded human history,"" they noted, writing that perceptions of attractiveness could ""play an important role in guiding the choice of partners with high-functioning immune systems.""

The researchers wrote that many aspects of innate immunity are strongly influenced by genetic factors and ""undoubtedly grant their bearers improved ability to provide direct benefits as well.""

It is further possible, they said, that the potential direct benefits are sex-differentiated – a factor that necessitates further study.

""The results of the current research suggest that facial attractiveness may provide insights into one's immune function, particularly as it relates to one's ability to efficiently combat (primarily) bacterial threats. Additionally, for men, facial attractiveness may also provide cues to their ability to efficiently manage viral threats and neoplastic growth. Although future research is needed replicate these results, the current research suggests that a relationship between facial attractiveness and immune function is likely to exist,"" they concluded.",https://www.foxnews.com
212,Bryan Cranston on his 'white blindness': 'I need to change',Melissa Roberto,"

Bryan Cranston is opening up about his ""white blindness,"" and how his recognition of it led him to turn down a directing job.

Back in 2019, the Emmy-winning actor was approached by Matt Shakman and asked if he'd be interested in directing a play based on Larry Shue's 1984 comedy ""The Foreigner."" It's about an Englishman who prevents the conversion of a Georgia fishing lodge he's staying in into a Ku Klux Klan meeting place.

""It is a privileged viewpoint to be able to look at the Ku Klux Klan and laugh at them and belittle them for their broken and hateful ideology,"" Cranston said in an interview with the LA Times. ""But the Ku Klux Klan and Charlottesville and white supremacists — that’s still happening and it’s not funny. It’s not funny to any group that is marginalized by these groups’ hatred, and it really taught me something.""

Cranston admitted he had laughed at the play for years. But now, following recent events of social and racial injustice, such as the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed, caused him to face his own white privilege.

""And I realized, ‘Oh my God, if there’s one, there’s two, and if there’s two, there are 20 blind spots that I have … what else am I blind to?'"" Cranston questioned.

The former ""Breaking Bad"" star added: ""If we’re taking up space with a very palatable play from the 1980s where rich old white people can laugh at white supremacists and say, ‘Shame on you,’ and have a good night in the theater, things need to change, I need to change.""

Cranston, 65, recalled telling Shakman he'd rather be open to the idea of portraying an ""old white man"" for another project.

""I’m 65 years old now, and I need to learn, I need to change,"" he reflected.

Cranston's turning down of the director position led him to explore another offer, a role as Charles Nichols in ""Power of Sail,"" directed by Weyni Mengesha and written by Paul Grellonng. According to the Times, Cranston plays ""an aging, highly respected Harvard professor who faces intense backlash for inviting a white nationalist and Holocaust denier named Carver to speak at his annual symposium.""

""Power of Sail"" sees characters questioning the boundaries of free speech. For this reason, the actor believes conversations around the topic can be changed.

""There need to be barriers, there need to be guard rails,"" he said.

""If someone wants to say the Holocaust was a hoax, which is against history … to give a person space to amplify that speech is not tolerance. It’s abusive.""

She criticized San Francisco for its lethargic effort to reopen schools and for a 2021 vote to rename dozens of schools she called ""a crowd-sourced embarrassment that placed Dianne Feinstein, Abraham Lincoln and Paul Revere among the names to be stricken.""

Even many San Francisco Democrats backed López's ouster. That included Mayor London Breed.

López said, however, that critics of hers and of the school board are doing ""[a]nything to dismiss even the discussion of racism."" She added that a much-criticized effort to rename schools started in 2017 ""[i]n response to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.""

In a separate Medium post, López said she will continue to be active in San Francisco's schools.

""This will not change where we come from, who we are, what we represent, what we have accomplished and what we will continue to do in service of others,"" she said. ""It’s unfortunate that those emotions were taken advantage of and led to an election costing taxpayers millions and the pouring in of funds from special interest groups. Regardless of our stances on specific issues, that should not circumvent our right to a democratic process.

""I will continue to work within our public schools, with our future teachers and build connections within higher education to advance these positions. I will take my teacher, M.Ed, youngest Latina ever elected, 2-term President, PhD pursuing self to the next fight, and the next, and the next.""

Breed is now responsible for appointing replacements for López and the other two recalled school board members.

""The voters of this city have delivered a clear message that the school board must focus on the essentials of delivering a well-run school system above all else,"" Breed said in response to the election results.

""San Francisco is a city that believes in the value of big ideas, but those ideas must be built on the foundation of a government that does the essentials well,"" the mayor continued. ""I want to recognize all the parents who tirelessly organized and advocated in the last year. Elections can be difficult, but these parents were fighting for what matters most – their children.""

215,Loudoun County father arrested at school board event says school tried to cover up daughter's bathroom assault,Jessica Chasmar,"

A parent who was arrested during a June school board meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, is accusing the district of trying to cover up an alleged bathroom sexual assault by a gender-fluid individual against his daughter in order to further its transgender rights agenda.

Scott Smith was found guilty of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in August after he was filmed being dragged by police from the Loudoun County School Board meeting on June 22. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail, all suspended, contingent on a year of good behavior, Loudoun Now reported at the time.

CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR ACCUSES LOUDOUN COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD OF BEING 'CHILD ABUSERS'

Smith’s image went viral among left-wingers as an example of parents run amok, and the National School Boards Association cited his arrest in a letter last week requesting the Department of Justice to provide federal law enforcement to respond to an increase in violence against school officials across the country. Attorney General Merrick Garland later pledged to have the Department of Justice and the FBI investigate harassment of school board members.

Now, Smith says there’s much more to his story, telling The Daily Wire that his behavior at the June 22 meeting stemmed from an incident weeks earlier at his ninth-grade daughter’s school, Stone Bridge High School in Ashburn, in which he said a boy wearing a skirt entered the girls’ bathroom and assaulted his daughter on May 28.

""We can confirm a May 28, 2021 case that involved a thorough 2-month-long investigation that was conducted to determine the facts of the case prior to arrest,"" the sheriff’s office told Fox News. ""This case is still pending court proceedings. The Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office is not able to provide any documents that pertain to a pending case."" The sheriff's office confirmed that the case involved sexual assault.

All juvenile records are sealed, but Smith’s attorney Elizabeth Lancaster told The Daily Wire that the boy was subsequently charged with two counts of forcible sodomy, one count of anal sodomy, and one count of forcible fellatio.

In response to a public records request by The Daily Wire, the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that a May 28 report with ""Offense: Forcible Sodomy [and] Sexual Battery"" at Stone Bridge High School does exist.

The suspect was arrested two months later following an investigation by the sheriff's office.

Minutes before Smith’s arrest at the June 22 board meeting, Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) Superintendent Scott Ziegler declared that ""the predator transgender student or person simply does not exist,"" and that to his knowledge, ""we don’t have any record of assaults occurring in our restrooms,"" The Daily Wire reported.

Smith told the outlet that he flew into a rage at the meeting after Ziegler's comments, and after a local progressive activist said she did not believe his daughter’s story.

""If someone would have sat and listened for 30 seconds to what Scott had to say, they would have been mortified and heartbroken,"" Lancaster, Smith's attorney, told The Daily Wire.

On Aug. 11, nearly two months after Smith’s arrest, the school board voted to approve its transgender rights policy, which requires teachers to call students by the pronouns they identify with and requires bathroom renovations in order to make them more private.

Smith said he received a letter before the vote informing him he was banned from the school board building.

Then on Oct. 6, the sheriff’s office said a 15-year-old boy was charged with sexual battery and abduction of a fellow student at Broad Run High School in Ashburn. In an Oct. 7 press release, the sheriff's office said the suspect forced a female victim into an empty classroom where he held her against her will and inappropriately touched her.

The outlet, citing a government official, reported that the boy accused in the Broad Run case had the same name as the student who allegedly assaulted Smith's daughter.

Lancaster, Smith's attorney, also told the outlet the suspect in the Oct. 6 incident was the same boy who allegedly attacked Smith’s daughter.

Lancaster did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Rosiak reported in a tweet thread that the school district had ""quietly"" transferred the boy to Broad Run High School after the alleged May 28 incident at Stone Bridge. It is unclear whether any disciplinary action was taken against him.

The school district did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Smith’s wife, Jess, said prosecutors told her the suspect’s court date had been postponed from this Thursday to Oct. 25 in order to handle both cases together.

""It has been so hard to keep my mouth shut and wait this out. It has been the most powerless thing I’ve ever been through,"" Scott Smith told The Daily Wire. ""I don’t care if he’s homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, transsexual. He’s a sexual predator.""

The parents did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.

An Uber driver and the mother of four children who was murdered in Pennsylvania this month begged for a passenger to spare her life in a robbery attempt which resulted in her death, according to dashcam evidence.

""I’m begging you, I have four kids,"" said 38-year-old Christi Spicuzza, according to dashcam video footage of the gruesome crime, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.

PHILADELPHIA MAN, 2 MINORS CHARGED IN BEATING DEATH OF ELDERLY MAN DURING CARJACKING

Spicuzza, of Turtle Creek, was found dead on Feb. 12 with a single gunshot wound to the head in Monroeville, about 10 miles east of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny County Police Department stated.

On Feb. 10, around 9:15 p.m., Spicuzza picked up a 22-year-old passenger named Calvin Crew. Upon entering the vehicle, Crew allegedly pulled a gun out and placed it to the back of Spicuzza's head, according to a criminal complaint. In the complaint, police discussed evidence found on Spicuzza’s dashcam.

The complaint states, according to the Post-Gazette, that Spicuzza made clear to Crew that she had a family. Crew responded, ""I got a family too. Now drive.""

Crew allegedly told Spicuzza that if she followed his demands then everything would ""be all right,"" just before Crew reaches for the dashcam and the footage ends.

Crew was arrested on Thursday and arraigned Friday before District Judge Robert P. Dzvonick. Pending a preliminary hearing on Feb. 25, Crew is being held without bail in the Allegheny County Jail, the Post-Gazette noted.

Spicuzza was reported missing on Feb. 11 after she failed to return home after driving for Uber the night before. Her body was discovered the following day by a delivery driver and Pitcairn police found her vehicle in the 500 block of Fourth Street in Pitcairn.

An Oklahoma Democrat congressional candidate is under fire for allegedly verbally attacking several pre-teen girls while at the home of a friend who was hosting a sleepover with multiple middle school girls present.

Abby Broyles, a candidate for Oklahoma's 5th Congressional District, went to the friend's house on Feb. 11 and became more and more aggressive as she continued to drink wine throughout the night, according to NonDoc.com.

The report states that Broyles insulted the girls attending the sleepover after becoming intoxicated, according to multiple people interviewed by the news outlet, who said that she allegedly said one girl was an ""acne f--ker,"" and hurled multiple insults at other young girls as well.

""Hispanic f--ker,"" she allegedly said to one girl, and ""judgy f--ker,"" to another.

One of the young girls left the room in tears after being insulted by Boyles, according to the report.

Broyles also allegedly vomited into a laundry basket as well as a girl's shoe, according to the report.

When asked by NonDoc if she had gone to the house where the event allegedly occurred, she denied any involvement and called the allegations ""awful and false.""

""I saw the tweets. I have been out of town on a fundraising trip, and they are awful and offensive and false,"" Broyles said to the news outlet. ""I mean, I get trolled on Twitter all the time, but I don’t know these women and I don’t know what is behind this, but it’s just not true.""

Broyles added that the allegations could have been ""cooked up,"" and suggested that the 12- and 13-year-old girls' mothers were using the allegations as a political attack against her.

""I’m running for office. You don’t think this is a political attack? You don’t think this is something they cooked up?"" Broyles said.

Broyles also threatened to sue NonDoc, according to the report.

""[Broyles] called somebody acne f’er, somebody Hispanic f’er, called my daughter judgy f’er for not wanting to sleep with a blanket that she cleaned up wine with.""

However, in an interview with KFOR, Broyles admitted to going to the house where the sleepover took place. She said that her friend handed her a medication, which gave her an ""adverse reaction"" causing her to hallucinate.

""She asked me to come over. She asked me to bring some wine. We had wine and sushi and a couple of hours later, we were upstairs in their theater room watching a movie,"" Broyles said. ""For years I have struggled with stress and anxiety and insomnia. I took the bar exam on two hours of sleep. I mean, this is how far this goes back for me. And she knows that. And she gave me a medication I had never taken before. And I had an adverse reaction. Instead of helping me sleep, I hallucinated. And I don’t remember anything until I woke up or came to, and I was throwing up in a hamper.""

During the interview, she apologized to the families of the young girls and had a message for people who think she's making excuses for her actions: ""You don’t know me.""

""I would never ever say anything hurtful. I’ve never, ever would say something hurtful like those things. And that’s why I know I was not in my right mind. I know that that’s what happened because of that combination of things. And I deeply, deeply regret it,"" Broyles said.

Broyles claimed that she was ""misquoted"" by NonDoc and said she ""never told them that I wasn’t there.""

After the editor-in-chief of NonDoc.com played a recording of the conversation to KFOR, Broyles told the news outlet that she was ""caught off guard"" by the phone call. Fox News Digital also listened to the recorded interview between a NonDoc reporter and Broyles.

""That phone call was terrifying and caught me off guard. I remember hearing the accusations and just repeating ‘no, no, no’ and then hanging up. I was happy to be in the TikTok video with the girls, which was obvious proof of my attendance,"" Broyles told KFOR.

Pelosi said that even if Russia doesn’t face steep sanctions by choosing not to invade Kyiv, Congress may look to secure its own response regarding the Kremlin’s aggressive behavior during recent months.

The speaker, along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., and Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said that Russia can expect ""brutal"" sanctions if it violates Ukraine’s sovereignty.

Roughly 40 Republican and Democratic members of Congress joined the weekend’s events in Munich to show their solidarity with NATO and Ukraine.

Penn’s Lia Thomas narrowly beat out Yale’s Iszac Henig in the 100 free at the Ivy League Championship on Saturday night and set a new meet record in the event.

Thomas finished with a 47.63 mark while Henig finished with a 47.82 mark. Thomas’ mark is also a record for Blodgett Pool at Harvard University, where the meet was taking place.

Henig, who is transitioning from female to male and uses male pronouns, had some momentum going into the race. He had set a meet record in the preliminary race earlier Saturday and even topped Thomas. He had the lead in the first back and forth before Thomas turned on the jets.

It’s the third individual win for Thomas during the week.

Thomas raced in her first individual event Thursday and won convincingly.

The senior got off to a slow start in the 500 free and had to come back against Princeton’s Ellie Marquardt. But Thomas pulled away by the midpoint of the race. She finished in a time of 4:37:32 and took home first place.

On Friday night, Thomas set a record in the 200-yard freestyle competition on her way to another conference title. She finished in first place with a mark of 1:43.12, setting a record for the event and at Blodgett Pool.

TRANSGENDER SWIMMERS LIA THOMAS, ISZAC HENIG CLOBBER IVY LEAGUE COMPETITION AMID DEBATE OVER ELIGIBILITY

The wins give Thomas some momentum going into the NCAA Championships.

There was some question over whether she would be able to compete given the debate over the NCAA’s recently updated transgender participation policy.

Last month, the governing body for college athletics announced its updated transgender participation policy, saying eligibility would be determined on a sport-by-sport basis. If there is no national governing body for the sport, then the NCAA sport will follow the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) policy.

The NCAA said its policy would become effective March, starting with the Division I Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships, March 16-19.

On Feb. 1, USA Swimming updated its policy requiring transgender athletes who are competing at an elite level to have small levels of testosterone – half of what Thomas was allowed to compete with – for at least 36 months before being eligible. Thomas’ future in the pool was immediately uncertain.

However, the NCAA said last week the Administrative Subcommittee of the Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports (CMAS) decided that it wouldn’t alter its testosterone guidance after all, stating that ""implementing additional changes at this time could have unfair and potentially detrimental impacts on schools and student-athletes intending to compete in 2022 NCAA women's swimming championships.""

222,'Covington kid' Nick Sandmann thinks Kyle Rittenhouse should sue for defamation: ‘Hold the media accountable’,Brian Flood,"

Former Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann – who famously settled a defamation suit against CNN – thinks Kyle Rittenhouse should sue news outlets to ""hold the media accountable"" after liberal pundits rushed to judgment on his case.

""The parallels between me and Kyle Rittenhouse are impossible not to draw,"" Sandmann wrote in a column for the Daily Mail in which he directly reached out to lend support. ""The way the media has treated you is terrible, and you don't have to face it alone.""

RITTENHOUSE TRIAL: JURORS RESUME DELIBERATIONS: LIVE UPDATES



Rittenhouse, an Illinois man on trial for intentional homicide and other charges in the shooting deaths of two people during chaotic August 2020 demonstrations in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was quickly labeled a ""White supremacist"" by liberal pundits at the height of protests sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse says he acted in self-defense and a jury is currently deliberating to decide his fate.

""Kyle was almost immediately labeled a 'white supremacist' and a 'domestic terrorist.’ To many, my red MAGA hat clearly meant that I was a racist,"" Sandmann continued. ""Kyle wasn't given his day in court by his critics. And neither was I. The attacks on Kyle came from the national news media, just as they came for me. They came quickly, without hesitation, because Kyle was an easy target that they could paint in the way they wanted to.""

In January 2020, CNN settled a multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit filed by Sandmann – who became known as the ""Covington kid"" – over the liberal network’s botched coverage of a viral confrontation with a Native American elder that had portrayed the Kentucky teen as the aggressor.

JESSE WATTERS ON KYLE RITTENHOUSE TRIAL PROSECUTION AND LIBERAL MEDIA REACTION: 'THEY WANT TO SCALP THIS KID'

CNN SETTLES NICK SANDMANN DEFAMATION LAWSUIT IN COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL CONTROVERSY



The $250 million defamation suit sought damages for the ""emotional distress Nicholas and his family suffered"" in the fallout of the network's reporting. The settlement amount was not disclosed.

Sandmann was swept up in the 2019 controversy after a video clip depicted the ""MAGA"" hat-wearing student smiling at Nathan Phillips beating a drum and singing a chant as he was surrounded by Sandmann's peers, who all had joined in on the chant in front of the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

However, several mainstream media outlets, including CNN, portrayed the incident with Sandmann and the other teens as being racially charged before it was discovered by additional footage that a group of Black Hebrew Israelites had provoked the confrontation. The radical group threw racial slurs at the students as they were waiting for their bus following a March For Life event in Washington, D.C.

Footage then showed Phillips, who was in town for the Indigenous Peoples March, approaching the students amid the rising tension between the two groups.

Sandmann believes Rittenhouse went through similar agony as the liberal media rushed to judgment.

""This is the problem with liberal media outlets in the United States. They want to get the story first, get the most views, make the most money, and advance the agenda from liberal patrons,"" he wrote. ""These outlets cover themselves when they are wrong with small footnotes at the ends of long articles, clarifying that new information has come out and that they have updated their coverage. News shouldn't be a scoreboard that constantly changes. News is about coverage that includes a statement of facts that does not need to be corrected. But, the liberal media doesn't do this. The liberal media rushes to be the first to report.""

LIBERAL PUNDITS, TWITTER TROLLS LABEL KYLE RITTENHOUSE A ‘WHITE SUPREMACIST’

Sandmann wrote, ""In our hyperpolarized society, the first impression of Kyle has been set in stone, probably for the rest of his life,"" specifically calling out President Biden, LeBron James and Rep. Ayana Pressley, D-Mass., in addition to countless liberal pundits.

A guest on MSNBC compared him to a ""school shooter,"" while another said he is ""arguably a domestic terrorist."" MSNBC’s Joy Reid referred to him as a ""vigilante,"" and Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., used the ""White supremacist"" term when talking about Rittenhouse during an appearance on CNN in March.

""With Kyle's name dragged through the mud, and the clear effect it is having on him, many have started to ask the question whether Kyle should sue for defamation. While I am by no means an attorney, I have gained some experience on the ins and outs of defamation and can offer an educated guess on what the outcome would be if Kyle were to sue,"" Sandmann wrote, explaining how difficult defamation cases are to win.

""Should Kyle sue? It first depends on what happens in the trial, as those elements would come into play were he found guilty. However, if Kyle is innocent it would create an easier road to winning,"" Sandmann wrote. ""If Kyle is prepared to take on another burden in his early life, with the acceptance that it might result in nothing, I answer, give it a shot and hold the media accountable.""

Sandmann believes that ""one of the saddening parts of this media onslaught is that it has taken young people like Kyle and myself to expose how corrupt the media really is,"" and, as a result, he couldn’t wait for a verdict before weighing in.

""I cannot hold back on the media's public execution of him before the trial has concluded,"" Sandmann wrote. ""At this time I would like to use my platform to let Kyle know that I am here for you and if you ever would like to reach out to me, I am about the only person our age to have an idea of how the media is treating you. The way the media has treated you is terrible, and you don't have to face it alone.""

""You won’t have to register?"" her father asks on the other line later in the conversation.

""I won’t have to do none of that,"" Tubbs replies.

""So what are they going to do to you then?""

""Nothing,"" Tubbs answers, then laughs.

Tubbs pleaded guilty last month to the cold case attack, which took place in women’s restroom at a Denny’s restaurant, when the suspect was two weeks shy of 18 and identified as a male named James Tubbs. After being arrested roughly eight years after the crime, Tubbs began identifying as a woman, according to prosecutors.

She received a sentence of two years at a juvenile facility because Gascon’s office declined to transfer the case to adult court, adhering to one of the progressive prosecutor’s day-one directives barring ""children"" from being tried as adults. She could serve as little as six months and won’t have to register as a sex offender.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY DA GEORGE GASCON BACKPEDALS ON PROGRESSIVE DIRECTIVES AMID CRIME WAVE, PUBLIC BLOWBACK

Tubbs’ victim, who was 10 at the time of the attack, told Fox News Digital that Gascon’s handling of the case has been ""insulting"" and ""unfair"" to her.

""The things he did to me and made me do that day was beyond horrible for a ten-year-old girl to have to go through,"" she said. ""I want him tried as an adult for the crimes he committed against me.""

She said the light sentence was offensive and hurtful and offered her ""no true justice.""

""I’ve also heard that my attacker goes by she/them pronouns now,"" she added. ""I see it also unfair to try him as a woman as well, seeing how he clearly didn’t act like one on January 1st of 2014.""

LA PROSECUTOR BLASTS POLICY CHANGE AMID CONTROVERSY OVER TRANS CHILD MOLESTER CASE

In one of the calls, Tubbs asks the caller to start using female pronouns.

""So now they're going to put me with other trannies that have seen their cases like mine or with one tranny like me that has a case like mine,"" Tubbs says. ""So when you come to court, make sure you address me as her.""

Then she says that if she goes to prison she’s getting a sex change surgery to go into the women's facility, and the other person says, ""There's some b---es in there too.""

Gascon issued a statement Sunday addressing the case.

""Like every responsible office, we learn as we go, take feedback from the community, and make necessary adjustments based on our experiences and the complex nature of this work,"" he said, adding that ""a small number of cases"" necessitate flexibility denied to his prosecutors under his edicts.

CALIFORNIA BILL WOULD ALLOW CITIZENS TO ENFORCE GUN BAN, MODELED AFTER TEXAS HEARTBEAT LAW

""Specifically, we learned a lot from the Hannah Tubbs case about the need for a policy safety valve,"" Gascon said.

He also admitted that Tubbs went on after the 2014 attack to commit other offenses – including one in which DNA evidence linked her to the Denny’s assault.

""Ms. Tubbs had several charges in other counties after the juvenile offense but never received any services which both her past behavior and that subsequent to her arrest demonstrates she clearly needs,"" Gascon said. ""After her sentencing in our case, I became aware of extremely troubling statements she made about her case, the resolution of it and the young girl that she harmed.""

The recordings, however, were made in November, and sources tell Fox News Digital that prosecutors were well aware of them.

Last Wednesday, Gascon’s chief deputy Sharon Woo sent a memo to prosecutors back off a blanket ban on seeking to try juveniles in adult court.

At the time, Gascon’s office denied the move had any connection to the Tubbs case and instead said the change came as prosecutors await a series of state Supreme Court decisions that are expected to send multiple cases back to Los Angeles.

Then on Friday, in a series of five memos sent to staff, Gascon backpedaled on his other directives, saying exceptions could be made to once again bring charges that would carry sentences of life without parole and allow juveniles to be tried in adult court. He will continue to block his office from seeking the death penalty.

Gascon conceded that he’d come to accept his policies were too rigid ""after listening to the community, victims and colleagues.""",https://www.foxnews.com
225,White House declares Russian invasion in Ukraine,Brooke Singman,"

The White House is now calling Russian action in Ukraine an ""invasion,"" saying the ""swift and severe"" sanctions promised by the U.S. are on the way, Fox News has learned.

Russian troops arrived in eastern Ukraine hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would recognize the independence of two separatist regions, officials said.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: WHITE HOUSE DECLARES RUSSIAN 'INVASION', SAYS SANCTIONS COMING: LIVE UPDATES

Russian troops entered in Donbas, the name for the area where the two separatist regions, that have long fought Russia-backed rebels, Donetsk and Luhansk, are located, officials said, noting that they ""consider Donbas part of Ukraine.""

The Kremlin then raised the stakes further Tuesday, by saying that recognition extends even to parts held by Ukrainian forces.

A White House official told Fox News that administration officials are calling it an invasion.

""The invasion has begun,"" the official said. ""So our sanctions response has begun.""

RUSSIAN TROOPS MOVED INTO EASTERN UKRAINE'S BREAKAWAY REGIONS, EUROPEAN OFFICIALS SAY

Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer, during an interview on CNN Tuesday morning, was pressed on whether Russia’s latest activities would be considered an invasion.

""We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine, and you're already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe,"" Finer said.

When pressed again, Finer said: ""I hear an invasion as an invasion and that is what is underway.""

But Finer noted that Russia has been ""invading Ukraine since 2014"" and have been occupying a ""large piece"" of Ukraine since then as well.

""Although they have denied it, Russian troop presence in exactly the two—what they call republics, but they’re really provinces of a sovereign Ukraine—that they recognized yesterday,"" Finer said, referring to Putin’s recognition of the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk.

""So, Russia is essentially making overt what it has denied for some time, which is Russian troop presence in these places, and we’re taking steps in response to that,"" Finer said.

Pressed further, Finer again called the activities an invasion.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: GERMANY STOPPING NORD STREAM 2 PIPELINE APPROVAL

""I mean, again, I guess for the third or fourth time, I am calling it an invasion,"" he said. ""We are taking a severe response, including sanctions on Russia that will be rolling out in a matter of hours.""

As for sanctions, Finer told CNN that the public is ""already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe.""

Finer pointed to President Biden’s executive order on Monday, which he said effectively blocked ""all economic activity"" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Finer said administration officials later Tuesday would announce ""additional sanction steps"" that they plan to take ""that go directly at Russia"" in response to ""the egregious step that they took yesterday away from diplomacy and down the further path toward war.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday morning said President Biden has ""made clear that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would act with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 does not move forward.""

Germany overnight said it is taking steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia over Moscow’s latest actions in eastern Ukraine.

""We have been in close consultations with Germany overnight and welcome their announcement,"" Psaki added. ""We will be following up with our own measures today.""

The 764-mile pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany has not begun operating. Nord Stream 2 is owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Russia state company Gazprom.

Earlier this month, Biden promised to ""bring an end"" to Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, appearing with Biden on his first official visit to Washington, was far less explicit about stopping Nord Stream 2, but said that the U.S. and Germany would have the same approach on punishing Russia financially.

The Nord Stream 2 has seen a faster development and deployment despite sanctions placed on it by the Trump administration. With those sanctions removed, Germany remains keen to see the pipeline activated sooner rather than later.

Scholz had insisted that the pipeline is a ""business project,"" according to German outlet DW.

Biden last year removed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, allowing construction and activation to proceed.

The plan to allow Russia to develop the pipeline to create leverage in times of political crisis may have backfired, as Germany has also rapidly grown dependent on the completion and activation of the pipeline.

Meanwhile, senior administration officials told reporters on Monday evening that they will ""continue to pursue diplomacy until the tanks roll.""

After officers arrived on the scene, Bethel was transported by Miami Fire Rescue to Jackson Memorial hospital in ""critical condition.""

Per the statement, officers had ""responded to a call of a possible suicide attempt;"" however, that has since been clarified with the statement noting, ""This was a tragic accident."" No foul play is suspected.

Her family released a statement to Fox News Digital characterizing her as a devout believer in Jesus Christ and a patriotic, strong conservative.

Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya blamed Ukraine for the current crisis during an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council Monday, arguing the way to ensure peace was for Ukraine to stop the shelling of its eastern separatists regions.

""I'll leave the direct verbal assaults against us unanswered,"" Nebenzya said, noting the harsh criticism Russia had received from most of the countries represented at the meeting. ""Now it's important to focus on how to avoid war and how to force Ukraine to stop the shelling and provocations.""

The Russian ambassador said that the country hoped Ukraine would ""stop talking to their own citizens in the east in the language of cannons and shooting and threats and shelling""

""Time and again we firmly asked Kiev to listen to the aspirations of the people living in Donbas and the Russian speaking residents of the country to respect their entirely legitimate desire to use their mother tongue and to teach their children in that language and also to honor the memories of those who liberated the land from fascists rather than those who fought on the side of fascists and had a hand in the killing of hundreds of thousands of people during the second world war,"" Nebenzya said.",https://www.foxnews.com
231,Seattle parents angry and upset as graffiti makes their city seem like 'a war zone',Elizabeth Economou,"

Like gray skies and rainfall, graffiti in the city of Seattle, Washington, is ubiquitous today.

Defaced public and private property can be seen everywhere — storefronts, apartment buildings, commercial vehicles, highways, bridges, street signs and recycling bins all bear the urban scrawl.

Nothing is spared. Everything appears to be fair game, including magazine display racks, utility poles — even historic sites. Taggers, apparently, do not discriminate.

Now, concerned parents and other residents are speaking out about the graffiti overgrowth.

""Graffiti is not some dude writing ‘Jim was here,’"" Ari Hoffman, a Seattle resident and parent of three children, told Fox News Digital.

""Graffiti is about marking territory, by gangs or dealers, or even by people living on the streets, who are being used for criminal activity,"" Hoffman added.

Hoffman is host of ""The Ari Hoffman Show"" on Seattle's KVI AM 570 and a former candidate for the Seattle City Council.

Vassie Skoulis, a mother of two and a Seattle homeowner, told Fox News Digital, ""Seattle has chosen to punish its residents who desire to live peacefully and respectfully with their neighbors and decided to stop enforcing rules, policies and laws.""



""Residents must clean up garbage and vandalism in their neighborhood,"" she also said.

Residents must also ""pay for property damage created by those who don't want to be part of any community,"" she said. Skoulis and her family live near the University of Washington.

Christine Villani, a 30-year resident of Seattle, said that she, too, has noticed an increase in graffiti over the past couple of years.

""I find it demoralizing, and I feel like I live in a war zone,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It says to me that nobody cares, anything goes.""

Villani lives near the Capitol Hill neighborhood, close to downtown. This area was the site of the ill-fated CHOP (Capitol Hill Occupied Protest) or CHAZ (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone) during the notorious 2020 ""summer of love"" riots, as then-Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan called them (later walking back that description).

The graffiti, Villani also told Fox News Digital, ""is an invitation to crime and more degradation in the environment. I don’t think enough is being done, and this contributes to the increasing dystopia that is Seattle now,"" she said.

More graffiti reported since COVID-19

To help combat the Emerald City's graffiti problem, Seattle has a ""Find It, Fix It"" mobile app. It's a tool for smartphone users to report graffiti to the city — as well as other issues such as abandoned vehicles and illegal dumping. Items dumped include needles and syringes.

While the app was launched in 2013, it appears the need for this reporting tool — along with a ""Graffiti Report"" phone line that any resident can call — is greater now than before.

""There has been an increase in graffiti reports since the beginning of the [COVID-19] pandemic,"" Sabrina Register, public information officer for Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), told Fox News Digital in an email.

""SPU speaks on behalf of the city's municipal code and graffiti abatement efforts, which are supported by the mayor’s office,"" Register also said.

""Mayor Harrell has made clear his commitment to addressing graffiti.""

Mayor Bruce Harrell, elected in November 2021, took office in January. He ran on a pro-police platform.

SPU said Seattle received 16,625 reports of graffiti on public and private property in 2021. That's a sharp increase from 2019, when some 13,000 complaints were registered.

Seattle received 16,625 reports of graffiti on public and private property in 2021.

Some 500,791 square feet of graffiti was ""abated"" by SPU’s Graffiti Rangers team in 2021. That's roughly the equivalent of 10 1/2 football fields, Register said.

The city of Seattle defines abatement as ""the removal or reduction/mitigation of writing, painting or drawing on public or private property without permission.""

Graffiti mars historical site for ‘first time ever’

""Graffiti has gotten really bad in the city,"" Paul Proios, manager of the popular 14 Carrot Café in Seattle’s Eastlake neighborhood, told Fox News Digital. ""For the first time ever, graffiti is marring the Hines Public Market building — a historical site — where our business is located.""

In his opinion, ""Seattle is a shadow of its former self. It is riddled with crime and graffiti — and not the cool graffiti that people call [street] art. [This] is the graffiti tagged by thugs,"" Proios also said.

The SPU's Register, meanwhile, did not say what might be fueling today's surge in tagging.

Instead, she said, ""SPU compiles data on graffiti reports and abatement but does not work to determine factors behind any reporting increase or decrease.""

Said Ari Hoffman on this point, ""Criminals do not want to be hassled, so they go elsewhere when the law is enforced. Any time a building is vacant, even for a few days, it is tagged almost immediately.""

‘Graffiti Rangers’ have grimy, grueling task

In tech-savvy Seattle, iPhone users are encouraged to become part of the solution by downloading the app from the App Store. Android users can access the app from the Google Play Store.

""With ‘Find It, Fix It,’ reporting an issue is as easy as snapping a photo with your smartphone, adding detailed information, and hitting submit,"" the city’s website tells citizens.

""The map's ‘drag and drop’ feature or the phone's own technology can be used to pinpoint the location,"" it also says.

""Customer reports of graffiti through the ‘Find It, Fix It’ app have helped SPU Graffiti Rangers quickly identify areas with multiple graffiti that can then be abated,"" Register explained.

Currently, the Graffiti Rangers team in Seattle consists of six SPU staff members who remove graffiti throughout the city, including in the neighborhoods of Freemont and Ballard to the north, and in Little Saigon and the Central District to the south.

The team aims to remove graffiti on public property within 10 business days — and within 24 hours or less for hate graffiti, according to the Seattle.gov website.

Register told Fox News Digital, ""Earlier this month, antisemitic graffiti was reported on the side of a convenience store and across the street from Jewish Family Service of Seattle. SPU Graffiti Rangers quickly responded and abated the graffiti within 24 hours.""

As for private property owners, they are the ones held responsible for removing graffiti when vandals strike, according to Seattle’s Graffiti Nuisance Ordinance.

WISCONSIN SINGER FRANKI MOSCATO VOWS TO ‘SAVE KIDS FROM HURTING THEMSELVES’

""We realize property owners and businesses are victims of a crime and offer resources to assist in removal free of charge,"" Register also noted.

Better lighting, more vegetation?

On its government website, the city of Seattle says, ""When graffiti appears on your home, apartment building, or business, take a photo to document for insurance purposes.""

It adds, ""After the police document the vandalism, remove or paint over the graffiti immediately.""

It also shares detailed advice with residents for making their property as ""graffiti-resistant"" as possible.

Residents should consider ""installing improved lighting and flashing motion-sensor lighting, growing vines or appropriate vegetation to cover unpainted retaining walls, installing a graffiti-resistant coating on your walls, keeping matching paint on hand to quickly paint out graffiti, and installing cameras to monitor activity on your property,"" according to the website.

Canadian Liberal MP Ya'ara Saks stated Monday that the onomatopoeia ""honk honk"" was a coded message meaning ""heil Hitler.""

Saks gave her testimony before Parliament on Monday, where she lamented perceived government inaction regarding the truckers.

""How many guns need to be seized?"" Saks asked from her podium. ""How much vitriol do we have to see of 'Honk Honk' – which is an acronym for 'heil Hitler' – do we need to see on social media?""

""Honk honk"" has become an unofficial slogan of the Freedom Convoy – a reference to the protesters' use of horns to pester and annoy residents and government officials until pandemic mandates are lifted.

Saks claimed the onomatopoeia was an ""acronym"" for ""heil Hitler,"" a phrase historically used by neo-Nazis as a declaration of support for White supremacy. It is likely that Saks misspoke – acronyms are an abbreviation of a phrase by the first letter of its words.

Saks received strong backlash on social media from users accusing her of fabricating the hypothesized link between ""honk honk"" and ""heil Hitler.""

However, Sake doubled down on her assertion the same day on social media.

""For those who think that 'Honk Honk' is some innocuous joke. I’ll just leave this here,"" Saks wrote Monday.

Saks linked to posts by ""antifascist"" and ""organizer"" Gwen Snyder as the source for her claim. Snyder previously claimed that ""honk honk"" was intended to mask the phrase ""heil Hitler,"" which is sometimes abbreviated to ""HH.""

233,"Philadelphia carjacking ring leader arrested and charged in two murders, police say",Louis Casiano,"

The alleged leader of a Philadelphia carjacking ring tied to two murders was arrested last week and could be linked to other incidents, authorities said Tuesday.

Jonathan Akubu, 28, was taken into custody Friday following a weeks-long crime spree, officials said. He is now charged with arson, conspiracy to commit carjacking, aggravated assault and with the Feb. 6 murder of George Briscella, a Marine Corps veteran and the son of a Philadelphia police officer, and the Feb. 12 killing of Aiah Gbessay.

""For all those who wish to sow chaos in our city, let today be a message that we simply cannot and will not accept these acts of violence,"" Mayor Jim Kenney said during a news conference.

Police officials said Akubu has several prior arrests for robbery, rape and aggravated assault. He is also suspected in carjackings outside of Philadelphia.

Investigators said they linked Briscella's murder with carjacking incidents on Feb. 4 and Feb. 2. In all three, two Toyota RAV 4s were stolen as well as a newer model Toyota Highlander. The same Toyota Camry was believed to be involved in the incidents, authorities said.

Patrol officers spotted the Camry and ran the plate and tag numbers, which led authorities to Akubu. Investigators eventually linked Briscella's murder to a Jan. 27 robbery and attempted carjacking, police said.

During that incident, a suspect shot a 42-year-old victim in the leg as he attempted to flee. On Feb. 12, authorities recovered Briscella’s stolen RAV4. Less than 12 hours later, Gbessay, 29, was killed and found in a parked SUV that had been reported stolen and was fully engulfed in flames.

A short distance away, a van owned by Gbessay was found on fire. Authorities believe the blaze was set intentionally.

In addition, 5.7 caliber cartridge casings found at the scene of Gbessay's murder matched casings from Briscella's death and the Jan. 27 carjacking. Investigators also matched .40 caliber casings and those related to a Feb.4 carjacking in which a woman was shot.

During a search of his Akubu's apartment, authorities found a handgun and AK-47 style rifle that had a tampered serial number, police said. The gun was stolen during an armed carjacking on Dec. 2. The victim in that incident was shot.

The weapon was matched to both deadly shootings, police said. Investigators believe other suspects worked Akubu and are involved in carjackings in King of Prussia and one in Millbourne, Pennsylvania.

Some media reports have named the victim, but Fox News is withholding her identity because of the nature of the allegations.

Martin was previously charged in September with manslaughter and concealing a body, WMMT reported.

The driver struck the jogger as she was near the Oak Shores Campground on Sept. 20, the report said. He then moved the body to a wooded area where he allegedly committed the sex acts, authorities said, according to the station. Martin led investigators to the site the next day, the report said.

Martin’s vehicle, a 2013 Ford F-150, had severe front-end damage when investigators first encountered him at a Walmart store in Oshtemo Township the day after the crime, the report said.

The suspect was found to have the woman’s cell phone, and he allegedly made attempts to conceal other evidence linked to the crime, according to the report.

Prior to the murder charge, Martin was freed on a $300,000 bond. Following the new charge, he was returned to custody but denied bond and was being held in the Van Buren County jail pending further legal action, the station reported.

The suspect was arrested several days ago at his girlfriend’s home in Big Rapids, WMMT reported.

Missing 4-year-old Serenity Ann McKinney, last seen alive in Kentucky on Christmas Eve two years ago, has been found dead, and the girl’s mother and her boyfriend have been charged with murder.

Despite arrests being made, the murder investigation remains ongoing, as it wasn’t reported until earlier this month that other concerned family members hadn’t seen the girl since Dec. 24, 2020.

Kentucky State Police said detectives located the body of the 4-year-old around 2 p.m. Friday in a wooded area near the 1300 block of Skyview Road in West Point near the Jefferson-Bullitt county line.

They were arrested in Kansas last week and extradited back to Kentucky.

Once the body was discovered, McKinney and Hill were charged with murder and abuse of a corpse by Kentucky State Police, the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office and the Kentucky Attorney General’s Office.

The Bullitt County Coroner’s Office transported the girl’s body to the Kentucky Medical Examiner’s Office in Louisville for an autopsy scheduled for Saturday morning. Results remain pending.

On Feb. 3, the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office revealed that concerned family members contacted authorities after not seeing McKinney in over a year. They reported last seeing McKinney alive on Dec. 24, 2020.

Her parents were refusing to cooperate, according to the sheriff’s office, and the girl’s last location was unknown at the time but believed to be possibly in the Shelby, Jefferson, Bullitt county area.

237,"Reported Biden plan to pay illegal immigrants $450K could surpass payments to some 9/11, military families",Adam Shaw,"

A reported plan by the Biden administration to pay $450,000 per person to illegal immigrants who had been separated during the Trump administration could exceed the payments given to some families of 9/11 victims and Gold Star families.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services are considering payments of $450,000 to those who crossed the border illegally and were separated from family members. It is in response to a lawsuit by civil rights groups. The payments could therefore amount to close to $1 million per family and $1 billion overall, although the Journal said that many families would get smaller payouts.

REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM BIDEN CABINET ON REPORTED PAYMENTS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: ‘HORRIFIC DECISION’

The report, which Fox News has not confirmed, sparked immediate outrage from Republicans and former Trump officials at the prospect of using taxpayer money to turn illegal immigrants into millionaires.

Critics quickly noted that it would be more than received by the families of those who lost loved ones in military service. The death gratuity is a single tax-free payment of $100,000. In addition, there is a life insurance program, the Servicemember Group Life Insurance (SGLI) but that maxes out at $400,000 -- and requires service members to have paid into it.

Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, made the contrast between the payments and what is given to those who have lost loved ones in service to the country.

""Biden wants to pay illegal immigrants $450,000 for their hardship while breaking our laws,"" Crenshaw, R-Texas, a Navy SEAL veteran, tweeted. ""For perspective, if a service member is killed in action, their next of kin gets an insurance payment of $400,000. Let that sink in.""

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DEBATES PAYING ‘HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS’ TO FAMILIES SEPARATED AT THE BORDER

Dozens of Republicans wrote to the heads of the various agencies on Friday making a similar point.

""The idea that we would give illegal foreigners who broke the law a check that exceeds the amount that our government supplies to our valiant and heroic Gold Star Families is shameful, reprehensible, and morally indignant,"" they wrote.

Separately, comparisons have been drawn to the payouts for 9/11 victims. The Journal reported that a DHS attorney complained that the payouts could amount to more than what some families of 9/11 victims received -- which funded averaged awards of around $2 million, but some significantly lower. However, other officials reportedly pushed back on the comparison, saying the U.S. government was not responsible for 9/11.

238,Jonathan Turley: Facebook says mentions of COVID-19's possible origins in Wuhan are now allowed. How generous,Jonathan Turley,"

Read the headline above a couple times. There was a time when such a headline would only appear on the satirical outlet The Onion but it is actually true.

Facebook has long banned anyone who discussed the evidence that a worldwide pandemic killing millions and destroying the global economy may have been released from a government lab in Wuhan, China.

Facebook would not allow the theory to be discussed as ""debunked"" despite widespread criticism that the social media giant was, again, engaging in corporate censorship.

The false claim that this theory was ""debunked"" was pushed by various media platforms as part of the criticism of then-President Donald Trump and his administration.

FACEBOOK ENDS BAN ON POSTS CLAIMING COVID-19 IS MAN-MADE

Now, however, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, and others have acknowledged that there is a basis for suspect the lab as the origin of the outbreak. So now Facebook will allow you to talk about it.

Since February, Facebook has been banning posts claiming the virus was man-made or manufactured ""following consultations with leading health organizations, including the World Health Organization"" who had ""debunked"" the claim. It was ridiculed at the time as entirely divorced from actual science. While the theory was not proven, it was never disproven.

Now, Facebook has declared ""In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made from our apps. We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge.""

Putting aside the lack of a basis for the earlier ban, the statement reflects that assumption that, of course, Facebook should be the arbiter of what can be discussed by users.

FAUCI PRAISES 'COMPETENT, TRUSTWORTHY' CHINESE SCIENTISTS

I previously wrote an op-ed for Fox News Opinion about how Facebook is running a campaign to convince young people to accept ""content modification"" as part of their evolution with technology. This reframing of expectations has been fostered by Democratic leaders who have pushed the social media companies for more censorship to protect people from errant or damaging ideas.

Last year, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., warned Big Tech CEOs that he and his colleagues were watching to be sure there was no ""backsliding or retrenching"" from ""robust content modification.""

In all of these exchanges, the underlying portrayal of the public is the same: they are unwitting dupes who must be protected from harmful thoughts or influences. It is safer for them to have these members and these companies determine what they can hear or discuss.

Facebook’s decision to allow people to discuss the lab leak theory follows the company's Oversight Board upholding a ban on any postings of Trump, a move that even prominent liberal figures like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have criticized as a danger to free speech.

Even Trump's voice has been banned by Facebook. Trump apparently remains too harmful for Facebook users to hear… at least until the company decides that they are ready for such exposure.

Facebook's announcement is meant to assure that it will not abuse its power as the overseer of any political or social discussions. It is similar to the benign dictator pitch where a government argues that, despite authoritarian powers, it uses such powers in a benign and tolerant fashion.

SEN. COTTON SAYS DR. FAUCI, NIH NEED TO 'COME CLEAN' ABOUT WUHAN LAB FUNDING

There is still an alternative. It is called free speech.

I have long described myself as an Internet Originalist. There was a time when the assumption was that the Internet is a forum for largely unimpeded free speech.

This was particularly the case with social media. Users of Twitter and Facebook state a desire to hear the views of other individuals or groups.

Yet, companies like Facebook started to assert the right to monitor those exchanges and decide if it approves of the views or representations being made. What began with censoring out violent threats soon morphed into ""misinformation"" or ""harmful"" thoughts on subjects ranging from climate change to COVID-19 to election fraud.

It is a familiar pattern as speech controls become insatiable and expansive. We would never tolerate a company like Verizon intervening in telephone conversations to correct or cut off arguments. However, Facebook now regularly censors views and is running a glitzy ad campaign to get people to love the company for its paternalistic limits on what they can see and discuss.

I do not know if the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab. However, it is less likely that we will find an answer with companies actively preventing people from sharing information and views on the subject.

Yet, it is probably more important to understand how a little free speech escapes from Facebook. The fact is that it did not escape. It was a controlled release.

Facebook and other companies have turned a rolling ocean of free speech on the Internet into a swimming pool of censored and managed expression.

Worse yet, according to its ubiquitous commercials, Facebook wants us to love it for the loss of free speech.

So rejoice, America. Facebook and its censorship board will now allow us to discuss whether China is responsible for the release of this virus… for now.

On the heels of the major arrest of an alleged carjacking ringleader accused of murdering two people, Philadelphia’s mayor said city residents ""should be concerned about their safety"" and their surroundings as there are ""too many guns on the street.""

Mayor Jim Kenney was speaking to reporters during a Tuesday press conference discussing the arrest of 28-year-old Jonathan Akubu, who was accused of killing a 60-year-old Marine Corps veteran named George Briscella, whose father was a Philadelphia police officer, and 29-year-old Aiah Gbessay. Briscella’s murder was linked to previous carjackings, an attempted carjacking and a robbery. Gbessay was allegedly fatally shot inside a vehicle, which was then set on fire.

PHILADELPHIA CARJACKING RING LEADER ARRESTED AND CHARGED IN TWO MURDERS, POLICE SAY

Authorities who searched his home found multiple handguns, including an AK-47-style rifle, officials said.

Akubu was also allegedly found to have been tied to the robbery and attempted carjacking of a 42-year-old man, who was shot in the leg. He was hit with a slew of charges, including murder, aggravated assault, arson, carjacking and robbery, authorities and reports have said.

PHILADELPHIA TOP COP VOWS ‘JUSTICE’ FOLLOWING BROAD DAYLIGHT ATTACK THAT LEFT 12-YEAR-OLD WOUNDED

After speaking about Akubu’s alleged crimes, Kenney was asked about a purported ""escalation"" in violence, to which he said he had noticed from Philadelphia Police Department Homicide Unit Captain Jason Smith’s descriptions of the recent crimes that ""every single description had a pretty powerful gun involved in the process.

""I don’t know about you,"" he added, ""but those guns and the types of those guns should not be in Philadelphia and should not be available to anyone in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or, in my opinion, the United States of America.""

He described how he felt it was ""harder to get a driver’s license in Pennsylvania than it is to get a gun.""

When asked if he thought people felt safe in the city, he said, ""I think people should be concerned about their safety.""

""I think that there are too many guns on the street,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t hide in the basement, but I would be concerned about my surroundings. Be concerned about, in a car, what’s around me. It’s what you do in the city.""

He went on to say he did not advocate for anyone carrying guns other than law enforcement.

President Biden’s climate czar, John Kerry, warned that Russia’s war against Ukraine could distract the world from the climate change crisis and produce ""massive emissions"" that will negatively impact the globe.

""I'm concerned about Ukraine because of the people of Ukraine and because of the principles that are at risk, in terms of international law and trying to change boundaries of international law by force,"" Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, said in an interview Monday on BBC Arabic, MEMRI reported Wednesday. ""I thought we lived in a world that had said no to that kind of activity. And I hope diplomacy will win.""

""But it could have a profound negative impact on the climate obviously. You have a war and obviously you’re going to have massive emissions consequences to the war. But equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose certainly big country attention because they will be diverted and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" he continued. ""So, you know, I think hopefully President Putin would realize that in the northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of the nation that was over frozen land.""

""Now it's thawing, and his infrastructure is at risk,"" he added. ""And the people of Russia are at risk. And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""

Kerry, who has faced criticism for his own impact on climate change, made similar comments Sunday when he told GZERO Media’s Ian Bremmer that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will have a ""monumental impact on the ability and willingness of people to do what’s necessary"" to curb emissions, and it will be ""very tough for the climate agenda, there’s no question about it.""

Kerry's made the comments days before Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday by land, air and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on the European continent since World War II.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

245,What is Burisma Holdings? The story behind the scandal-tied Ukraine firm that hired Hunter Biden,Hollie Mckay,"

Burisma Holdings has been thrust into the media limelight as the Democratic-controlled House presses forward with its impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s dealings in Ukraine.

But lost in much of the coverage of the dramatic hearings is what this Ukrainian natural gas firm actually does and the controversy it's generated in the past -- beyond the now well-known fact that Hunter Biden served on its board, thus arousing the suspicion of the Trump White House and touching off the series of events leading to impeachment proceedings.

TENSIONS BOIL OVER AT IMPEACHMENT HEARING, AS NUNES ACCUSES SCHIFF OF 'GAGGING' LAWMAKERS

While both sides of the aisle fiercely debate the propriety of the younger Biden's role, the company itself has long been tied to controversy.

“Burisma’s reputation in Ukraine is low, and was dubious before (the impeachment inquiry) due to the scandals surrounding the owner,” Igor Egorov, the president of the Kiev-based nonprofit Anticorruption Entrepreneurial Front, told Fox News, underscoring that it hasn’t stopped the company from financial growth.

“Burisma is among the top five oil, drilling, and production companies and planned to drill 21 new wells in 2019, expanding its production capabilities,"" Egorov said. ""Burisma Holdings controls many companies in the oil & gas industry – the group was successful due to relations with authorities.”

The White House embroilment unraveled in late September following a whistleblower complaint, which raised alarms that Trump may have withheld military aid to Ukraine in pressuring the newly elected Volodymyr Zelensky government to investigate Hunter Biden’s recent role as a Burisma board member.

Hunter Biden joined the board after being discharged from the Navy Reserve for drug use, at a time when Burisma was engulfed in corruption investigation woes, and at a time when his father Joe Biden as vice president was leading the Obama administration’s effort to curb Ukraine’s endemic corruption. He stepped down in April when Biden announced his 2020 presidential aspirations.

Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly made the accusation that Biden inappropriately leveraged his White House position to have Viktor Shokin, then Ukraine's leading prosecutor, fired in March 2016 to avoid implicating Hunter in corruption investigations. Joe Biden's campaign has vigorously disputed this -- saying he urged the firing for the exact opposite reason: Shokin wasn’t doing enough.

Nonetheless, Burisma is on the Washington map amid the cloud of controversy.

“Burisma is better known in the U.S. than in Ukraine,” said Alexander Paraschiy, the head of research at Kiev-based investment firm, Concorde Capital. “Experts know that the company belongs to former minister of Yanukovych government, and taking into account that Yanukovych has a poor reputation, so [does founder Mykola] Zlochevsky.”

So who did Hunter Biden serve during his lucrative position earning upwards of $50,000 per month?

Burisma was founded in 2002 by oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, who was closely aligned to the now-exiled former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Zlochevsky served as the minister of ecology and natural resources from July 2010 until April 2012 and then as deputy secretary for economic and social security until February 2014 when the notoriously pro-Russian Yanukovych was forced to flee to Moscow.

Soon after, Zlochevsky himself absconded when Ukraine’s prosecutor general put him on the country’s watch list and opened numerous probes into his practices and multitude of businesses, flanked by allegations of money laundering and tax evasion. Moreover, questions have long swirled as to how he granted licenses for the development of mineral deposit extraction during his government post.

“[Zlochevsky] was suspected of violations while providing gas production licenses and permits to his own companies,” Paraschiy explained, emphasizing that even after Biden’s tenure on the board, he “doubted that the image has changed.”

Ukrainian records, according to The Wall Street Journal, show that Burisma’s two main subsidiaries were awarded their exploration permits during Zlochevsky’s official reign. His assets were frozen in the U.K, but citing a lack of evidence produced by the Serious Fraud Office, the Central Criminal Court in London later discharged the order.

Nonetheless, Burisma’s website touts that it is the “first, and only fully integrated gas operator in Ukraine engaged in the exploration, production, processing, transportation and final sale of hydrocarbons” and has 35 licenses in all major basins in Ukraine, and paid some $24.6 million in taxes over the past two years. It has also, using Hunter Biden’s image, promoted its desire to expand outside Ukraine.

Burisma Holdings did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

While its owner is known for a high-flying lifestyle of luxury cars and excessive residences, Burisma operates in the quiet, non-descript shadows and only lists an address in Cyprus, where the company is registered.

According to Christopher Hartwell, current fellow and former president of the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE) in Warsaw, registering in Cyprus is a common tactic of post-Soviet oligarchs.

“As Cyprus has some fantastic offshore tax benefits. It is the reason why Cyprus shows such high levels of foreign direct investment, which are really just piles of money passing through,” he explained. “It could be done to minimize tax liability, it could be done to access the European Union, or it could be done for money laundering. These are the top three reasons why Slavic companies register in Cyprus.”

Ukraine analysts also contend that while just about everything is in need of greater transparency – the country is rated 120 out of 180 of the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International – Hartwell stressed that “the energy trade has always been the worst.”

“The gas trade, for example, is how billions were siphoned off from the public and put into private hands, a problem which went on for years under government protection,” he continued. “Private energy firms are welcome in Ukraine as they provide much-needed competition against government monopolies, but given the heavy hand of government in every facet of energy, it’s still a too-cozy world with ample opportunities for corruption.”

Furthermore, Paraschiy pointed out that historically, [oil and gas] was a business of “people close to power, either central government or local governments.”

“We have some cases of private companies non-related to power brokers or oligarchs,” he said. “But, it is rather the exception.”

HAS JOSEPH MIFSUD RESURFACED? ALLEGED AUDIO OF MYSTERIOUS PROFESSOR EMERGES TWO YEARS AFTER DISAPPEARANCE

Another well-placed source connected to Ukraine’s energy industry, who requested anonymity, contended to Fox News that Biden came onto Burisma’s board “long after the questionable transactions occurred,” and the industry overall has made vast improvements in terms of corruption in recent years.

“Burisma did what many companies do all around the world. They hire people with recognition,” the source said. “Burisma is a legitimate producer of oil and gas, present on the new, liberalized market. We actively trade with them – buying and selling of gas – and they act in a professional, commercial manner.”

The insider commenced working with Burisma in 2014 soon after Biden joined the board but underscored that many were not personally aware he was even associated until it emerged in the press.

“I believe that my assistance in consulting the Company on matters of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of Ukraine,” Biden wrote in a release soon after joining the Board in 2014.

Others beg to differ.

“By inviting influential foreigners, Ukrainian business wants to get additional protection, PR and lobby mechanisms to grasp additional spheres of interest. Having Hunter Biden on board, the owner of Burisma wanted to correct the image and to get cover, because authorities are scared by the U.S. embassy in Ukraine,” Egorov said. “Hunter Biden, using the political capabilities of his family, acted as a rescue buffer between Burisma and Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. His work in the company of a corrupt official smells bad.”

But by 2017, Burisma announced that it was not encountering any active prosecution cases. It then inked a partnership with the Washington think tank, the Atlantic Council, centered on combating corruption efforts in Ukraine.

And despite the investigations having been shuttered years ago, Burisma’s days of being probed are perhaps not yet behind them.

In October, the country’s prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, announced that his office would be reviewing the closed cases to ensure that they were appropriately handled – with the Burisma file still on the table. State Department official George Kent testified at the first public hearing of the House impeachment inquiry last week that, “since U.S. taxpayers are wasted,” he “would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and how much was paid.”",https://www.foxnews.com
255,"Tucker Carlson: Americans have been trained to hate Putin, and will suffer because of it",Tucker Carlson,"

Since the day that Donald Trump became president, Democrats in Washington have told you it's your patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin. It's not a suggestion. It's a mandate. Anything less than hatred for Putin is treason.

Many Americans have obeyed this directive. They now dutifully hate Vladimir Putin. Maybe you're one of them. Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America's foreign policy. It's the main thing that we talk about. Entire cable channels are now devoted to it. Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in Eastern Europe.

Before that happens, it might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs?

TUCKER CARLSON: WHAT DOES JOE BIDEN'S ‘RUSSIA IS BAD’ CLASS TEACH?

These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no. Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that. So why does permanent Washington hate him so much?

If you've been watching the news, you know that Putin is having a border dispute with a nation called Ukraine. Now, the main thing to know about Ukraine for our purposes is that its leaders once sent millions of dollars to Joe Biden's family. Not surprisingly, Ukraine is now one of Biden's favorite countries. Biden has pledged to defend Ukraine's borders even as he opens our borders to the world. That's how it works. Invading America is called equity. Invading Ukraine is a war crime.

So with every day, we move closer to some kind of conflict with Russia, a conflict that could easily spin out of control given that the people running us have no fine motor skills, the administration assures us this has nothing at all to do with ripping Joe Biden's personal debts to Ukrainian oligarchs. Not at all. It's completely and totally unrelated.

The point here is to defend democracy, not that Ukraine is a democracy. It is not a democracy. Ukraine's president has arrested his main political opponent. He has shut down newspapers and television stations that have dared to criticize him. So in American terms, you would call Ukraine a tyranny. But Joe Biden likes Ukraine. So Putin bad, war good. How will this conflict affect you?

Will affect you quite a bit, actually. Energy prices in the United States are about to go way up, and that means that everything you buy will become much more expensive, from the food you eat to the car you drive to the tickets you need to take your family on vacation this summer, assuming you can still afford a vacation by then. You're about to become measurably poorer. That's not a guess. Joe Biden has admitted this.

On the other hand, you're going to win an important moral victory against dastardly old Vladimir Putin, who is much, much worse than Justin Trudeau. Just so you know. So you can feel good about that because…because…let's see, come to think of it, why would you feel good about that? It seems like a pretty terrible deal for you and for the United States. Hunter Biden gets a million dollars a year from Ukraine, but you can no longer afford to go out to dinner. That's not a bargain.

So what are we missing here? What we're missing is the big picture, and that's why Joe Biden has dispatched Kamala Harris to explain that picture to us. Kamala Harris’ old job was to open America's border. She did that. Her new job is to keep Ukraine's borders closed. Kamala Harris was in Europe the other day to explain the whole thing. She began with a history lesson, letting the European peoples know about their recent past, which she assumes they've forgotten since so few of them speak English. She opened with a traditional salutation, ""listen, guys,"" because that's the way real historians and states people talk. This is Kamala educating:

KAMALA HARRIS: I mean, listen, guys, we're talking about the potential for war in Europe. I mean, let's really take a moment to understand the significance of what we're talking about. It's been over 70 years and through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security. We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe.

Listen, guys, you may be Europeans who live in Europe, but you don't fully understand the ramifications of war in Europe. That's your problem. The thing about Europe, you've had peace and security for more than 70 years. Kamala Harris just told the Europeans that.

HANNITY PREDICTS RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT COULD SPIRAL ‘OUT OF CONTROL’ VERY QUICKLY

And that, by the way, is true, if you don't count the breakup of Yugoslavia, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the 1990s or the Soviet occupation of half of the landmass, which you manage the enslavement of hundreds of millions. But apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, it's all been peace and security in Europe. Until now. The Soviets were fine. Vladimir Putin is bad.

What do we do about that? Kamala Harris explains that too.

KAMALA HARRIS: And the allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because, remember also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment and within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, although open, although it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect we believe has merit.

Got that. Take a breath and let it sink in. Here it is again: ""we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because, remember also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment and within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, although open, although it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect we believe has merit.""

Well, of course it has merit. The only question is what the hell are you talking about? And the answer is, Kamala Harris has no real idea what she's talking about. She can't even point to the direction of what she's talking about. Her mouth opens and predigested chunks of language come tumbling out in no particular order. It's soothing to listen to until you try to understand what it means.

As Kamala Harris told us just last month, ""It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day."" To which we'd respond: That's right, Miss Vice President Person, today is the first day of the rest of your life. Learn it. Love it. Live it. And while you're at it, eat, pray, love.

You could just imagine Vladimir Putin's reaction to all of this when an aide drops a translated transcript of Kamala Harris remarks on his desk. The Slovic mind is a hall of mirrors. It sees traps at every intersection. Clearly, Kamala Harris must be setting some sort of trap for the Russians here. Her words don't make sense, but she can't possibly be dim and childish. America is a superpower. It would never put a senile man and an imbecile in charge of the country.

WATTERS: AMERICANS ARE PLEADING WITH BIDEN TO DO SOMETHING FOR US ‘FOR ONCE’

On the other hand, maybe so. And by the way, it's not just our country. A few weeks ago, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, met with his British counterpart, Liz Truss. Lavrov asked Truss if her country recognized Russian sovereignty over Rostov and Varonis, both of which are actually parts of Russia. So it was a trick question. But Liz Truss, who used to work in sales, had no idea. So she replied that Great Britain would never recognize these regions as Russian, despite the fact they already are Russian.

So Liz Truss has no idea what she's talking about, either. But here's the thing: She wasn't embarrassed about that. None of them are embarrassed about that.

John Bolton knows a lot. On the other hand, he spent decades weakening America with terrible foreign policy ideas and getting a lot of decent people killed for no good reason at all. So you think at this point, if justice were real, John Bolton would be living in isolation and shame somewhere, spending his days in atonement. That's what you would do. But that's not what he's doing. No. John Bolton went on MSNBC demanding yet another war, this one with the nuclear-armed power.

ANDREA MITCHELL: Do you US forces should go in to defend Ukraine?

JOHN BOLTON: Well, I think it's probably too late for that now, but I would say this the red line between being a treaty ally of the United States and not being one is significant. But the issue, as in all issues like this is would a Russian invasion and takeover of Ukraine adversely affect American national security and that of its NATO's allies? The answer that absolutely yes. … We did not act appropriately early. I think we should have had more American forces in Ukraine not to fight the Russians, but to train with the Ukrainians and to show those Russian generals looking across the border and seeing American flags, I wonder what that means. Biden took that off the table, saying there would be no American forces involved and he got nothing for it.

So, the only problem with Joe Biden's Ukraine policy, says John Bolton, is that it's too weak. Your kids aren't fighting there right now, hunkered down in February, shooting at Putin. Let's try a winter war in Russia. No one's done it before, but we have high hopes.

Alexander Vindman is, in fact, demanding it. Unlike the British Foreign Secretary, Alexander Vindman knows quite a bit about Ukraine. In fact, he was born there. Alexander Vindman believes you have a moral obligation to defend his homeland, and if you don't, you're a murderer. He said so on MSNBC.

ALEXANDER VINDMAN: I think these folks, these right-wing pundits and the GOP that supports them really frankly have blood on their hands because they're encouraging and enticing this kind of opportunism from Putin. And it's not what, it's not just kind of plain rhetoric like you could say something without consequences, like too often happens in here in the United States. This has real consequences. And people are going to die because of this.

Yeah, they're going to die. So your job is to take up arms in defense of Alexander Vindman's home country or else you're evil, your blood on your hands and that's effectively our policy. Ok, Alexander Vindman. You got us. It’s a compelling argument. We're in. What's this going to cost us to defend the country you were born in? Well, in fact, Joe Biden addressed that question today. ""Defending freedom will have cost for us here at home,"" Biden said. ""We need to be honest about it."" Really. Biden went on to outline what he called the pain of our sanctions.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS: NIKKI HALEY SAYS BIDEN ‘FAILING’ IN ‘MAJOR LEADERSHIP MOMENT’

JOE BIDEN: We're implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions, VEB and their military bank. We're implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russia's sovereign debt. That means we've cut off Russia's government from Western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade and its new debt and our markets or Europe markets, either. Starting tomorrow and continuing in the days ahead. We'll also impose sanctions on Russia's elites and their family members they share and the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies, and should share the pain as well. And because of Russia's actions, we’ve work with Germany to ensure Nord Stream two will not, as I promised, will not move forward.

So let's put aside the question of why you would ever want to shut down any energy pipeline anywhere, ever, especially now crude oil is nearing $100 a barrel, it's the highest price since 2014. That's not a small thing because you need energy to live. It's not negotiable. So how does having less energy help the United States? Joe Biden didn't even hint at an answer to that. He didn't answer any questions. He ran away the second he had finished reading the script.

Back in real life, every person knows nothing will tank our economy faster than cutting off the supply of fossil fuels, because despite what you may have heard from noted energy experts like Sandy Cortez, a country of 340 million people can't run on windmills and solar panels. And even if we had enough of those, which we don't, we don't have the transmission lines to get that power to your house, and we won't for a long time.

So that's all a lie. But don't worry, says Kamala Harris. The administration has ways of fixing the spike in energy prices. They've got it under control because it turns out Kamala Harris is secretly in charge of global energy markets.

TUCKER CARLSON: AMERICA WOULD GAIN NOTHING FROM STARTING WAR WITH RUSSIA

No, just kidding. Harris has no idea what a barrel of oil costs. She doesn't know how natural gas is measured. What she knows about is diversity, and that's pretty much it. Though she does sense that everything is about to get a lot more expensive for you. And so to warn you, she mentioned it today.

REPORTER: The president has already said Americans will be facing some economic fallout or some hardships. Can you explain to Americans what exactly will they face if this happened?

KAMALA HARRIS: Sure, as the president talked about in his speech, we are aware that, again, when America stands for her principles and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for, for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost. And in this situation that may relate to energy costs, for example.

So, what are the principles were defending here? We're defending a regime that has arrested their main rival and shut down opposition media. What principles are at stake here, apart from rewarding the Biden family's patron?

But at least she's honest enough to say what's happening in Eastern Europe quote may relate to energy costs. That's a euphemism for: Good luck filling your truck this August. Does that bother Kamala Harris? Maybe it does in the short term. Voters aren't going to like it in November. The party will be punished.

But they're doing it anyway. They're shutting down domestic energy pipelines here. They're picking a fight with Europe's biggest gas supplier. So maybe there's something bigger at work here. Maybe they're thinking long-term. Maybe they're not against rising oil and gas prices. Maybe there for them. Maybe expensive energy would be good for the many renewable deals their friends and donors are invested in.

We don't know the answer. We do know that all of us are about to suffer. So we hope that hating Vladimir Putin was worth it.

266,Microwave weapons are targeting US officials at home and abroad,Jennifer Griffin,"

Republican and Democratic lawmakers are demanding answers about who is responsible for what a growing consensus of experts believe are targeted attacks on U.S. diplomats and national security officials using pulse microwave energy that many now believe was used as a weapon to harm American citizens.

""In December of 2017, I made which now is kind of the fateful trip to Moscow,"" explained Marc Polymeropolous, a 26 year veteran of the CIA, who was forced to retire as the CIA’s official for clandestine operations in Europe after suffering a mysterious traumatic brain injury and debilitating side effects following a trip to Moscow in 2017.

""I woke up in the middle of the night with an incredible case of vertigo, of tinnitus, which is ringing in the ears. I was falling over. I was nauseated,"" Polymeropolous said in an interview with Fox News. ""There was no mistake that something really, really terrifying happened that night in Moscow. I had been in Afghanistan. I spent time in Iraq. This was the most terrifying experience of my life.""

SUSPECTED INTRUDER NEAR CIA HEADQUARTERS SHOT BY FBI AGENTS

The veteran CIA officer was staying at the Marriott Hotel near the US Embassy when he was attacked. His case resembles symptoms described by 40 US diplomats in Havana serving at the US Embassy and a dozen US diplomats serving in China who in 2016 began experiencing extreme vertigo and nausea, sometimes following a loud, piercing sound that experts now believe was the result of directed radiofrequency energy in the form of a microwave.

Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the top Republican and Democrats heading the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a stern statement acknowledging for the first time US officials had been ""attacked,"" suggesting the attacks are ongoing and ""increasing."" Now two cases are being investigated on U.S. soil, including one that allegedly took place last year near the ellipse outside the White House and another that targeted a National Security Council official.

Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire has pressed the State Department and intelligence community for years about the alleged attacks on US diplomats.

In a heated exchange with Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, she referenced open source reporting of the incident outside the White House. ""One of the incidents described here happened on the ellipse in late 2020. And that's very close to the White House,"" Senator Shaheen said to Haines.

PETE HOEKSTRA: NO SPYING ON AMERICANS – HERE'S HOW WE STOP BIDEN ADMIN FROM MISUSING INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

David Relman of Stanford led the National Academy of Sciences study requested by the State Department which until recently remained classified. The report concluded these US diplomats had been targeted by a pulsed radiofrequency.

""A form of microwave energy that we don't typically see in the world around us. It's not the continuous wave energy that comes out of our cell phones or out of our microwaves. It's not that,"" Relman explained. ""It is a high energy, very short delivery of this microwave energy. It's a form that isn't common in the world around us, but is used, for example, by militaries for radar.""

The CIA’s Polymeropolous described the brain fog and loss of long-distance vision. ""It became pretty clear that something pretty terrible happened.""

GINA HASPEL: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CIA'S FIRST FEMALE DIRECTOR

At first, he says, when he raised the issue with doctors at the CIA, few believed him. He says he is now getting more support from the new director of CIA, William Burns, who promised to help at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during the Annual Threat Assessment hearing: ""I said in my confirmation hearing before the Senate that I would make this a very high priority to ensure that my colleagues get the care that they deserve and that we get to the bottom of what caused these incidents and who was responsible. And, I've tried very hard in the three weeks now that I've been at CIA to demonstrate that commitment. I've visited Walter Reed and NIH to thank the wonderful professionals there for the support they've provided.""

After facing frustrating bureaucracy for 3 years, Polymeropolous is finally getting treated at Walter Reed’s National Intrepid Center of Excellence, which specializes in traumatic brain injuries.

""There's conventional wisdom that this is a portable weapon, a microwave weapon that we knew the Soviet Union and the Russians certainly developed and tested for a long time. And it's designed to incapacitate. I mean, it's pretty insidious because it also doesn't leave any kind of open scars or wounds,"" Polymeropolous said.

""It's a terror weapon that I think the Russians, in my view, have employed. And they've done so to very good effect because it's caused a great deal of worry and fear among the US diplomatic community.

""I think it's also important to remember, going back to something that we talked about earlier, that Putin has made various efforts to undo western military support for Ukraine, including during the Trump Administration,"" she said.

269,Putin wants to bring back the Soviet Union. We must not allow that to happen,Michael Pompeo,"

Days ago, Vladimir Putin did what we all have known he was going to do for months: He invaded Ukraine.

This invasion was by no means inevitable. We in the Trump administration knew that it was Putin’s aim to establish Russian dominance and influence over all the old Soviet bloc countries, including in Ukraine. We were able to keep an invasion like this one from occurring by establishing a model of deterrence not just with respect to Russia, but with anyone who threatened to harm or undermine our interests.

We kept the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from being completed, we withheld talks on a new START treaty, and we worked with our partners in NATO to increase defense spending and present a greater potential response to any act of Russian aggression.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

We knew what Putin wanted to accomplish if given the chance, and we took the steps necessary to ensure he didn’t get that chance. Make no mistake, Putin is about the business of trying to bring back the Soviet Union. We must not allow that to happen.

It is not Vladimir Putin who has changed; it’s American leadership that’s changed.

The Biden administration has been threatening to execute what Vice President Kamala Harris called ""some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest, that we’ve ever issued."" But Putin has shown from day one that he is largely unconcerned with Western sanctions. As Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said in response, ""We don’t need your sanctions … after we will have no borders and after we will have no economy or part of our country will be occupied. Why would we need those sanctions then?""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE IN LARGEST EUROPEAN ATTACK SINCE WWII

These sanctions, and their threat weakened by the administration’s announcement that they would not include Russia’s access to the SWIFT banking system or their oil and gas industry, failed as a deterrent to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

President Biden has been weak toward Putin, unstable and unclear.

They failed because sanctions are just one tool for executing effective diplomacy and establishing deterrence, yet the Biden administration has acted as if they are sufficient as a reactionary strategy. They are not; deterrence must be multifaceted – military force projection, American energy dominance, allied resolve, and clear, concise dialogue and expectations.

In the Trump administration, we incorporated all these factors into our strategy of diplomacy and deterrence, yet the Biden administration has allowed each to slowly erode with feckless, muddled responses to Russian aggression that have neither projected strength nor imposed costs on our adversaries. They have stopped speaking in the one language that Putin understands: strength.

They gave Putin a new START treaty without extracting any costs or concessions; allowed Russian thugs to hack the Colonial pipeline, driving gas prices up and creating lines at the pump not seen since the 1970s; and they gave him Nord Stream 2, ceding a market for our natural gas to the Russians.

When Russia massed the largest number of forces in modern history on the border of Ukraine, Joe Biden said it was OK if Putin invaded, as long as it was only a ""minor incursion."" And once they did invade, struggled to call it as such.

Team Biden wasted grand summit gatherings in Europe attacking the Trump administration and celebrating a ""return to normalcy,"" all while failing to lead and prepare for Russian aggression toward Ukraine. And when Putin began threatening invasion, the response from Europe was not unified, and American leadership was nowhere to be found.

President Biden has been weak toward Putin, unstable and unclear – he doesn’t understand what is at stake in the fight against Russia and doesn’t know that it takes strength to defend America and keep us out of war.

This conflict will have major implications for the American people. Energy prices will skyrocket due to the invasion’s effect on global energy markets. The rising cost of energy means that the historic inflation levels we’ve seen under the Biden administration will only continue to increase. Instability in Europe will also strain our economic relationships here at home, meaning less jobs for Americans. And how can we make the case for controlling our own southern border while we allow a free nation’s sovereign borders to be violated with impunity?

When I was a young tank commander in the Army, I was stationed in Germany and tasked with patrolling the Iron Curtain, to be ready for Soviet invasion. The readiness and presence of NATO’s collective armed forces, coupled with tough diplomacy from President Ronald Reagan, deterred the threat of Soviet invasion and ultimately brought the Soviet Union to its knees. The invasion of Ukraine – both Crimea in 2014 on the Obama administration’s watch and now the Donbas under the Biden administration – should be a wake-up call for all of us.

America has been weak and unclear with our adversaries when the world needed to be at its strongest and most clear. Our adversaries have noted the Biden administration’s failure to act with resolve in Afghanistan, in the face of Chinese aggression, and now in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine.

As Russia launches a full-out military assault on Ukraine, its state media organs are launching an assault of their own to bolster the Kremlin.

Russian state media presenters have hailed the invasion as ""historic"" and repeated the Kremlin line that Ukraine was the true aggressor. State media outlets have repeated accusations of ""genocide"" by Ukrainian troops against Russians in Luhansk and Donetsk, the regions President Vladimir Putin declared ""independent"" while Russian troops were supposedly securing them this week as part of a ""peacekeeping"" mission.

Putin's claim that he wants to purge Ukraine of fascism is eagerly repeated and supported in hopes of swaying citizens who still hate the loathsome Nazi Germany regime with whom they brutally warred 80 years ago.

""Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia has started a military operation in Ukraine in order to clear the country of Nazis,"" state-run Sputnik News repeated.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS: RUSSIAN MEDIA SPINNING COVERAGE TO ‘CONFUSE’ THE PUBLIC, EXPERTS SAY

It's an old line to sell to the Russian public, said Ret. Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis, a military analyst with experience on the ground in Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and had family members perish in the Holocaust.

""The misinformation campaign is long in the tooth,"" Maginnis told Fox News Digital. ""Keep in mind Putin's puppet was jettisoned by the Orange Revolution and that made it necessary for the Kremlin's tyrant to find a way of delegitimizing Zelenskyy.

""So, Putin launched a GRU-hosted misinformation effort to color the Zelenskyy government as anti-Russian and anti-separatist. His use of ‘Nazi’ resonates with many Russians because of the slow-healing scars still plaguing the Russians from World War II.""

Russia’s all-out attack on Ukraine has killed at least 57 people and wounded 169 during the first day of Putin's full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s Health Minister Oleh Lyashko said Thursday, and Ukraine is bracing for things to get worse. Russian missiles pounded Ukrainian infrastructure and military targets.

President Biden announced new sanctions in response from the White House on Thursday, as well as movement of 7,000 U.S. troops to Germany.

RT America, the Kremlin network based in Washington, D.C., was in full spin mode as well. Chyron on RT America Thursday included ""Disarming Ukraine,"" ""Who Is The Main Agitator?"" and quoted the Russian defense minister's claim there was no threat to Ukrainian civilians.

On Thursday afternoon, journalist Dan Cohen told RT America viewers it was ""absolutely false"" that Russia was the aggressor and said Putin's depiction of the conflict as a ""denazification campaign"" was ""absolutely accurate.""

UKRAINE NO LONGER IN CONTROL OF CHERNOBYL SITE, OFFICIAL SAYS

""[The United States is] sending weapons and training to Ukrainian ultra-nationalist, Hitlerian, Nazi forces,"" Cohen said Thursday.

Independent Russian journalist Ekaterina Kotrikadze said Putin's justification for war through state media was also to accuse Ukraine's leaders of ""Russophobia"" and claim they were attacking Russians living in eastern Ukraine.

""Russia is explaining to people inside of the country — to the Russian public — that it is actually defending its citizens inside of Donbas,"" she told CNN. ""On the state media … you could see that the propaganda machine was working, explaining that Kyiv is killing people.""

""The invasion has begun,"" host Yevgeny Popov said Monday on the state-run TV channel Russia 1, according to The Associated Press. ""But it wasn’t Putin who invaded Ukraine — instead, Ukraine went to war with Russia and Donbas.""

However, appeals to old Russian patriotism aren't entirely effective. Anti-war protests across the country directed at the Kremlin have broken out, from Moscow to St. Petersburg to Vladivostok.

""I suspect many modern Russians get their news from a variety of sources and not just state-sponsored outlets,"" Maginnis told Fox News Digital. ""Today, for example, there were reports of demonstrations popping up across a number of Russian cities protesting the Kremlin's assault on Ukraine. Most Russian people consider Ukrainians family, not enemies.""

272,"'US will need to get involved' if Russia invades NATO countries, top House Republican warns",Jon Raasch,"

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee said Russia's siege on Ukraine is a threat to the U.S. and told Fox News that America would need to get involved if nearby NATO members were attacked.

""What we're seeing is that Russia, under [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's leadership, has invaded a validly elected democracy, an independent nation, violating international law,"" Rep. Mike Turner told Fox News. ""It's a threat to Europe and a threat to our NATO allies and therefore to the United States.""

Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday after amassing troops on the nation's border for months and reached the capital after one day of fighting.

Putin ""has openly stated that his goal is to reunite the geographical territory of the Soviet Union, and we should believe him,"" Turner said. ""I don't think U.S. troops should be engaged directly, but we do play a role here that is very important.""

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: BIDEN PROMISE TO RESTORE WORLD ORDER COLLAPSES AS GLOBAL CHAOS REIGNS

President Biden campaigned on the promise of standing up to Russia, tweeting in 2020 that ""Vladimir Putin doesn't want me to be President. He doesn't want me to be our nominee. If you're wondering why – it's because I'm the only person in this field who's ever gone toe-to-toe with him.""

Turner told Fox News: ""Vladimir Putin has very openly threatened the West and the United States. He specifically included in his exercises leading up to invading Ukraine a nuclear weapons exercise, which of course places the United States, our cities at risk.""

""Whenever you have a leader of a nation violating international law and openly threatening the world with weapons of mass destruction, we are entering a very difficult and very dangerous time,"" the Ohio Republican continued.

Thursday's attack marks the second time Putin invaded Ukraine under Biden's leadership. The Russian leader was sanctioned after he annexed Crimea in 2014 when Biden was vice president.

""The Obama administration did not rise to that occasion after Crimea was invaded and annexed into Russia,"" Turner told Fox News.

Putin ""sees an opportunity to be able to do this at the least cost,"" since the Biden administration showed ""weakness"" during the Afghanistan withdrawal and ""mixed messages with respect to Ukraine itself,"" Turner said, noting that the Russian leader likely also reflected on the Obama administration's response to the previous invasion.

PUTIN MAY HAVE OVERPLAYED HIS HAND BY INVADING UKRAINE, EXPERTS SAY: 'MASSIVE MISCALCULATION'

Nearly 140 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians had died as of early Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address.

The U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russia in response to the invasion. Turner agreed with the move.

""Threatening the United States, threatening NATO, threatening our Western allies are only made good if he can continue to build and strengthen his military,"" Turner told Fox News. ""Sanctions can have an impact on that.""

Sanctions on technology will hinder Russia from acquiring more military supplies and will hinder their cyberattacks, the Ohio Republican said.

273,"Russia says Finland, Sweden could face consequences if countries move to join NATO",Louis Casiano,"

A Russian official on Friday issued a warning to Finland and Sweden should both nations intend to join NATO, saying such moves would have ""serious military-political repercussions.""

During a news briefing, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova made the remarks as Russian forces continue to battle the Ukrainian military following an unprovoked invasion into the neighboring country.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL SANCTION PUTIN; HEAVY BLASTS HEARD IN KYIV: LIVE UPDATES

""Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging the security of other countries and their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences,"" she said in a video clip.

The ministry later posted the same threat on Twitter.

""We regard the Finnish government’s commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe,"" the tweet reads. ""Finland’s accession to @NATO would have serious military and political repercussions.""

""Partnership with the alliance is very important for us. While maintaining a strong national defense, we retain the opportunity to apply for membership,"" he wrote. ""It is the sovereign right of each nation to make decisions on its security policy.""

In an interview with Fox News, Finnish Ambassador to the United States, Mikko Hautala, said Russia has always voiced opposition to his nation's membership to NATO.

""I think we are really well prepared. We have one of the best armies in Europe. We have a really strong defense. We have really good international partners,"" he said. ""We are not in a position that we would get scared because of one statement. There's nothing new. That's the old Russian position.""

""They've been telling that for many, many years,"" he added.

Ukrainian leaders have expressed a desire to join NATO, but Russia has expressed fierce opposition to an expansion of the 30-member alliance, particularly on its border with neighboring Ukraine.

As of Friday, Russian forces were closing in on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, but American intelligence experts have said Ukraine is putting up a greater resistance than anticipated. In an effort to defend the country, the government has handed out arms to citizens willing to fight.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that the alliance would defend its member states should Moscow launch an attack.

On Friday, he said NATO deployed its Response Force for collective security after Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened the alliance by telling it to withdraw forces from member nations or face consequences.

""This goes far beyond Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said. ""This is about how Russia is actually challenging, contesting core values for our security. Then warning that NATO should withdraw all forces and infrastructure from almost half of our members.

NATO has not engaged in the conflict and has not sent any troops to help defend Ukraine. On Thursday, President Biden said the United States could get involved should Russian forces move into NATO countries.

274,Lawsuits unveil alleged culture of teen sex abuse in Louisville police mentorship program,Andrew Keiper,"

Public service was in his blood.

His father served in both the local fire and police departments, and his brothers preceded him in the Louisville Metro Police Department’s Youth Explorer career mentorship program. His interest in becoming a police officer led him to enroll in the mentorship program when he was about 14.

""C.F.,"" who uses a pseudonym to protect his identity in a civil lawsuit, said that what should have been a golden opportunity to learn about law enforcement became a nightmare of exploitation and sexual abuse.

C.F. is one of seven people to file civil lawsuits against current and former LMPD officers who served as advisers in the Youth Explorer program. All plaintiffs filed under pseudonyms to protect their identities. He detailed his alleged abuse in a 2018 interview with Fox News.

His story shows an alleged pattern of grooming, coercion and sexual assault by former officer Kenneth Betts, as well as a lack of accountability by police leadership.

Betts is married with a young daughter. The disgraced officer resigned from the Louisville Metro Police Department on March 24, 2014, following an internal investigation into an inappropriate relationship the officer allegedly had with a teenage female Explorer cadet.

“It was beyond, like, friendly conversations,” C.F. said. “[Betts] would ask for nude pictures. Ask for favors. Stuff like that. Ask if I would want to go work details or do ride-alongs with him.”

When he and “N.C.” – another former Explorer cadet who also filed suit in Louisville – were between the ages of 15 and 17, C.F. said Betts would often initiate inappropriate actions with the teens.

""From there, it led on to him giving us oral sex and us giving him oral sex. And it led to him – penetrating me and N.C.” — C.F.

One night, Betts picked them up to help him move paperwork from the office to his home. After the task, he offered the minors alcohol and allegedly began to “come on to” them in unwanted ways. C.F. said he felt coerced and pressured by the power Betts had over his career ambitions and opportunities within the program.

“I had about two or three [drinks], and I had a buzz. And that’s when he pulled us back into his room, started taking our clothes off and kind of pushed us onto the bed,” he said. “And from there, it led on to him giving us oral sex and us giving him oral sex. And it led to him – penetrating me and N.C.”

The allegations of the sexual abuse, harassment, coercion and inappropriate actions during ride-alongs, where cadets would join officers on patrol, are recurring themes in Louisville and similar Explorer scandals across the country.

C.F.’s story is just one of many that have helped lawyers, local politicians and prosecutors piece together a picture of sexual abuse, negligence and cover-up within the program and police department. It adds to a growing list of abuses by officers involved in the nationwide program spanning decades. C.F.’s lawsuit also helps establish a pattern of allegedly sexually abusive behavior by Betts specifically.

STIRRING A HORNET’S NEST

In March 2016, a former Youth Explorer cadet with accusations of sexual abuse approached Louisville Metro Councilman David Yates. At the time, Yates was council president, and understandably hesitant about suing the city he represents. He said he needed incontrovertible evidence to file suit – and he got it.

“Pictures of the genitalia of the abuses that [the officers] had sent them,” Yates said. “This was something that – this was when you realized that this is real.”

Yates and other attorneys said about 15 victims have come forward with stories of abuse. Fearing public embarrassment and retaliation from the defendants, only seven – less than half – agreed to file lawsuits, fearing public embarrassment and retaliation. Those who did file only agreed to under assurances that their identities would remain private.

Eventually, Yates would drop from the litigation due to his role in local government. Local attorney Tad Thomas took over the lawsuits, and has been advocating for the plaintiffs since.

""I felt the need to at least follow up to investigate, to look. And as I did -- it became overly evident that several youth had been abused."" — David Yates

Yates filed the first lawsuit on behalf on N.C. on March 8, 2017. Former officers Betts and Brandon Wood are the primary accused abusers in the lawsuits. Also named were Maj. Curtis Flaherty, Chief Steve Conrad, Mayor Greg Fischer, as well as the Boy Scouts of America and Learning for Life – the two parent organizations of the Youth Explorer program. Flaherty was in charge of the local chapter.

“It just seemed so far-fetched that I maybe didn’t want to believe it,” Yates said. “I felt the need to at least follow up to investigate, to look. And as I did – it became overly evident that several youth had been abused.”

All defendants are named in multiple lawsuits. In total, the lawsuits name more than eight current or former LMPD officers.

At the center of the scandal are three former LMPD officers: the aforementioned Betts, Wood, and Flaherty, who ran the local Explorers program.

All three have left the force, and Betts and Wood are charged with sex crimes in both state and federal courts; each officer pleaded guilty and awaits sentencing.

Wood pled guilty to a federal attempted enticement charges and is scheduled to be sentenced May 28.

Betts pled guilty to federal enticement and and child pornography charges and will be sentenced May 23, although that date could be delayed.

Betts struck a plea deal that had him serve 10 to 15 years in prison, but the judge suggested the deal might be too lenient. Federal sentencing guidelines, according to US District Court Judge David Hale, call for a 27-year sentence for Betts. He’s also expected to plea guilty to state charges of sodomy, according to local news reports.

Attorneys for Betts and Wood would not comment or make their clients available for interviews. Similarly, LMPD officials did not respond to a number of requests for comment. Multiple attempts to reach Flaherty at his home were unsuccessful.

Flaherty has not been charged criminally for his role as supervisor of the local Explorer chapter. He has been named in all seven lawsuits filed by former cadets, with each plaintiff alleging the former officer acted negligently.

His attorney, Lee Sitlinger, said he expects the court to dismiss the allegations against his client.

“[They’re] basically claiming that he negligently supervised these officers who were volunteers as well in the program,” Sitlinger said. “The evidence would show the contrary. He ran a very safe program.”

To date, the LMPD Youth Explorer scandal has cast the police department into public scrutiny and tallied countless local headlines. The alleged misconduct by former officers Betts, Wood and Flaherty pulled a former U.S. Attorney into the fray as an independent investigator – costing taxpayers $140,000.

While the saga continues to unfold, plaintiffs in Louisville await justice.

276,Snake Island border guards who defied Russia warship 'may be alive': report,Lawrence Richard,"

The 13 Ukrainian troops on Zmiiniy Island, or ""Snake"" Island, might still be alive after defying a Russian warship last week – after they were previously believed to have been killed, the Ukrainian government said.

""The SBGSU and the Armed Forces, like the whole of Ukraine, have received hope that all of Zmiiny's defenders are alive,"" the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said in a Facebook post on Saturday, noting that Russian media claims the soldiers were captured, not killed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had announced Thursday that the soldiers were killed after a Russian warship approached the island and instructed the Ukrainian soldiers to surrender or risk being killed, the Washington Post reported. The Ukrainian military then lost communication with the border guards and they were presumed to be dead.

""I am a Russian warship,"" the ship blared to the nearby island, ""I ask you to lay down your arms and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary deaths. Otherwise, you will be bombed.""

The Ukrainians defied the ultimatum and responded: ""Russian warship, go f--- yourself.""

TRUMP WARNS 'WORLD WAR' COULD BE NEXT AS RUSSIA CONTINUES INVASION IN UKRAINE

Zelenskyy said he would award each of the 13 troops who ""died heroically"" with the title Hero of Ukraine, the Washington Post reported.

""May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever,"" he added.

But the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine provided hope the soldiers might still be alive.

""As previously reported, on February 24, the aggressor fired from naval weapons and used combat aircraft on border guards and soldiers of the Armed Forces on the island of Zmiiny. According to available information at the time, the infrastructure was destroyed and the island captured,"" it wrote in the post.

277,"American pastor faces fines, end of ministry under new Russian law",Perry Chiaramonte,"

An American missionary's bid to spread the Gospel in Russia is facing end times after authorities accused him of violating an anti-religion law that was sneaked into recently passed anti-terror legislation.

Christian pastor Donald Ossewaarde, 55, is the first American citizen to be charged under Russia’s new “Yarovaya” anti-terror laws that contain a provision that increases regulation on evangelism. Included is a full ban on any missionary activities in non-religious settings, meaning anyone who preaches outside of a church or designated religious center, faces stiff penalties.

Ossewaarde is due in court in the town of Oryol, 224 miles south of Moscow, after he held religious services in his home and posted advertisements for the service on bulletin boards in nearby housing blocks. The pastor was fined the equivalent of $630 for violating what is also known as the ""anti-sharing beliefs amendment.""

“The Yarovaya laws have sent Russia careening back toward the days of the Soviet Union in terms of religious freedom,” Jeff King, president of International Christian Concern, told FoxNews.com. “Donald’s case is likely just the tip of the iceberg; these laws affect everyone in Russia, not just foreign missionaries.”

Ossewaarde, an Independent Baptist from Illinois who first began evangelizing in Russia during a 1994 visit there after the collapse of the Soviet Union, moved to Ukraine in 1999 and Oryol, Russia, three years later.

His wife, Ruth, has returned to Illinois, where their home congregation Faith (Independent) Baptist Church is located in Bourbonnais.

""I didn't feel that she was safe [here],"" Ossewaarde told the Baptist Press. ""After I had a thinly veiled threat against myself and my wife so I just figured it was time for her to go home.""

Ossewaarde, who has traveled back and forth between Russia and the U.S. to raise money for his ministry, said he may follow his wife home soon. He has already referred his small group of congregants to the Russian Baptist Church.

""I want to complete the appeal process,"" he told the Baptist Press. ""If I can successfully challenge this it will make it easier on other missionaries that would probably otherwise be prosecuted.""

Many have criticized the new law and its anti-evangelism provisions, saying that it’s a means to block churches other than the Russian Orthodox Church from evangelizing to ethnic Russians.

Since the “Yarovaya” law was put into effect this past July, numerous missionaries have been charged and fined including

Sergei Zhuravlyov, a Ukrainian Reformed Orthodox Church of Christ representative, was arrested for preaching in St. Petersburg.

Ebenezer Tuah of Ghana, the leader of the Christ Embassy church, was arrested and fined 50,000 rubles for conducting baptisms at a sanatorium in the city of Tver.

Jim Mulcahy, a 72-year-old American pastor who is the Eastern European coordinator for the U.S.-based Metropolitan Community Church, was arrested and deported under the prohibition of missionary activities at non-religious sites. He promoted and held a ""tea party"" in Samara with an LGBT group. Authorities had targeted Mulcahy because they thought he may have been organizing a same-sex wedding.

While Ossewaarde’s family has returned to the United States, the pastor has stayed in Russia to fight the charges with assistance from ICC and legal counsel from the Slavic Center for Law and Justice.

“We are very hopeful that the judge in this case will do the right thing and overturn Donald’s case on appeal,” King said. “We’re also encouraged to see the U.S. State Department taking an active interest by sending personnel to attend his trial. Russia should not be allowed to get away with crushing religious freedom at no diplomatic cost to itself.”

Ossewaarde has been documenting much of his experience on his website since June. On Aug. 14, he recounted when he was detained.

“Three policemen came into the house while we were singing. They did not knock on the door or ring the bell; they just walked in,” he wrote. “They wanted to ask questions, but I told them they would have to wait until after the service. I invited them to stay for the service. They were there for singing and the entire sermon.

“After the service, they asked questions for about 45 minutes. They talked to all the people, too, and wrote reports,” he added. “They said they needed a complete package of documents on us just in case any questions arise. I asked if there had been any complaints against me. They said no.”

The pastor also claims that he was fingerprinted and questioned in a locked room for nearly two and half hours before being charged with violating the new law for gluing two gospel tracts to a bulletin board at the entrance of an apartment building and for conducting a religious service in his home.",https://www.foxnews.com

CNN Airport does not use the exact same feed as the standard CNN, as additional sports and weather segments are added while some graphic video is removed. CNN Airport also goes out of its way not to air any coverage of plane crashes or other disasters that could spook passengers.

As part of the deal, CNN paid airports to leave the network on, and many travel hubs even have agreements in which CNN pays for their TVs and infrastructure. The Philadelphia Inquirer previously reported that airports also receive ""up to six minutes each hour to promote the airport or local attractions"" as part of the deal.

""CNN Airport covers the costs related to the TVs and related infrastructure, provides programming specifically geared for airports, and pays us for the opportunity to be in our facility,"" a representative from Minneapolis-Saint Paul International told Fox News in 2018, while Miami International’s spokesperson simply pointed to a document proving that CNN is willing to pay the most.

Long-term contracts typically gave CNN the ability to curate content seen by travelers whether they like it or not. The eight-year contract that was signed in 2016 promises Miami International Airport ""a maximum annual guarantee of $150,000"" that may be adjusted annually to ensure the deal is on par with similar airports.

For years, the agreements had blurred the lines between news and advertising as the network blurred the lines between news and political activism.

280,Trump warns 'world war' could be next as Russia continues invasion in Ukraine,Brooke Singman,"

EXCLUSIVE: ORLANDO, Fla. — Former President Trump warned that Russia’s multi-front invasion in Ukraine could lead to ""world war"" and told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration is going to have to ""do a lot more than just sanctions"" to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.

During an exclusive one-on-one interview with Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday, the former president said Russia’s war on Ukraine ""never should have happened.""

""It is a horrible thing. It would never have happened under any circumstance, and it is what it is,"" Trump said. ""But there's great bravery being shown, and I think they’re doing one hell of a job—much more so than anybody would have thought possible.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

When asked if he had a message to Putin, the former president said: ""I have no message.""

""I just think it's a shame that this is going on. It's something that should not be going on,"" Trump said.

""Thousands of people, I mean, this can lead to much bigger than this one area,"" Trump warned. ""This could lead to a lot of other countries and can lead to world war.""

Trump said ""you never know how it starts, in a world war.""

""You never think a war is going to come out of it,"" he continued. ""All of a sudden, you end up in a world war.""

He added: ""This is a very dangerous period for our nation, for the country.""

Just before the interview, the United States, Canada and other European allies announced additional sanctions on Russia—specifically ""selected"" Russian banks to be removed from the SWIFT financial system.

Trump, reacting to the sanctions, told Fox News Digital: ""They’re going to have to do more than just sanctions, I suspect.""

""But sanctions are not, you know, Putin—he understands how to avoid sanctions, and he goes through other countries,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""He goes to China as an example.""

Trump, though, said the sanctions ""have to be strong, and they have to be swift, OK, to use a word, because that is a very powerful sanction, as you know, SWIFT.""

""And if they’re not, I can’t imagine—it’s just going to be a question of time,"" Trump said. ""It’s a very ugly thing that's taking place. Should have never happened.""

Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News Digital that China has been emboldened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in regard to its aspirations to take Taiwan.

""I do. I think that China would do that anyway,"" he said.

But the former president pointed to the ""way"" the Biden administration withdrew U.S. troops and military assets from Afghanistan, calling it a ""surrender.""

""Getting out was a good thing. I had it down to two thousand soldiers,"" Trump said, referring to his decision as commander-in-chief to reduce the footprint of U.S. troops in the region. ""We were going to get out with strength and dignity, but to take the soldiers, the great Army out first— we took our Army and Marines—we took them out first to do that and leave the Americans behind, leave other people behind, leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind.""

""We had 13 young people that were killed, many that were very badly hurt in the bombing and a couple of other things the way they got out,"" Trump said, referring to the Aug. 26, 2021 suicide bombing outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul during the withdrawal that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members – including 11 Marines, one Navy sailor and one Army soldier. Eighteen other U.S. service members were wounded. The bombing also left more than 150 civilians dead.

""I really think that was the most embarrassing—one of the lowest points in the history of our country,"" Trump said. ""And President Xi and Putin, they watched that, and I think they probably came up with ideas that they didn't have before seeing it, because it was grossly incompetent.""

Trump was asked if the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred under his administration, what he would do, but told Fox News Digital that he couldn’t say ""right now.""

""Well, I tell you what, I would do things, but the last thing I want to do is say it right now, because if somebody asks me that is in a position where they can utilize whatever it is I give them,"" Trump said. ""But I certainly wouldn't want to be talking about it on television or to the media too much.""

He added: ""But there are things you can do that would be very powerful.""

Trump said if Biden requested his help, he ""certainly would do that,"" but said the Biden administration is ""stuck in this situation that should not have happened, and we’re going to see how it ends up.""

""It is very sad, but there is a great amount of bravery being shown right now that’s been pretty incredible,"" Trump said.

""I don’t want to say,"" he said. ""I just don’t want to say.""

Meanwhile, shifting to social media, Trump, who has been banned from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat and has launched a social media company of his own, TRUTHSocial, was asked for reaction on Putin’s ability to use the platforms as he wages war.

""There's death in Ukraine, and he's able to use the power of very sick people,"" Trump said of Big Tech executives. ""These are very bad people that control it.""

""Truth,"" Trump said. ""It’s about the truth and I think it's going to be very big, and if you look at it now, how well it's doing—people are amazed—it’s trending like, number one all over the place, and it's going to be great, and we need it.""

Trump said the platform will give ""a voice,"" saying it is needed.

""Because these people, there's something wrong with them,"" Trump said. ""They’re almost, perhaps, they’re sick. Perhaps they're deranged.""

281,Texas Gov. Abbott signs bill banning vaccine passports,Houston Keene,"

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill into law banning businesses from requiring "" vaccine passports"" in the Lone Star State.

The governor signed the bill, S.B. 968, on Monday. It makes it illegal for any business in Texas to require proof of COVID-19 vaccinations to engage in business.

Abbott announced the move in a video posted to Twitter the same day, saying ""Texas is open 100%.

""Texans should have the freedom to go where they want without any limits, restrictions, or requirements,"" Abbott wrote. ""Today, I signed a law that prohibits any [Texas] business or [government] entity from requiring vaccine passports or any vaccine information.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT TAKES AIM AT ‘VACCINE PASSPORTS,’ ISSUES ORDER RESTRICTING STATE AGENCIES

In the video, Abbott said the state wanted to ensure Texans had ""the freedom to go where you want without limits"" and thanked the Texas legislature ""for getting this bill to [his] desk"" before signing the measure.

In addition to banning private businesses from requiring proof of vaccination, any business that does require proof of vaccination may not engage in state contracts and some state agencies that look over different business sectors may require compliance for licenses or permits.

The law still allows businesses to implement COVID-19 screening and infection measures that are in line with state and federal law. The law goes into effect immediately.

S.B. 968 was passed in the waning days of the legislative session. It came after Abbott signed an executive order into law banning state and local governmental agencies and political subdivisions from requiring proof of vaccination against COVID-19 to use services.

Abbott issued the executive order last month after announcing the end of the state’s mask mandate.

282,"Putin should understand NATO also has nuclear weapons, says French foreign minister",Louis Casiano,"

France's foreign minister said Russian President Vladimir Putin should understand that NATO also has nuclear weapons when making threats to deploy his arsenal.

Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was speaking with French television network TF1Info when he was asked if Putin's remarks were ""tantamount to threatening Russian use of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict,"" Reuters reported.

He said he believed so.

BIDEN ANNOUNCES MORE US TROOPS TO GERMANY, ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS OVER RUSSIAN INVASION: LIVE UPDATES

""Yes, I think that Vladimir Putin must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance,"" he answered during the Thursday TV appearance. ""That is all I will say about this.""

Hours earlier, Putin spoke from the Kremlin in Moscow where he said Russia would respond with force should other nations try and interfere with its military operations in Ukraine.

""Whoever tries to hinder us, and even more so, to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,"" the Russian president said.

Ukraine came under siege Thursday as Russia launched multiple airstrikes, prompting many to flee their homes and seek safety elsewhere.

Le Drian said Ukraine has not asked NATO member states to deploy military forces on the ground but is requesting humanitarian aid and financial assistance. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and leaders there have called for the alliance to cut diplomatic ties with Moscow.

The United States has imposed sanctions on Russia but has not pledged to respond with a military presence.

283,NY Times journalist suggests media concern for Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates racial 'biases',Lindsay Kornick,"

New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones offered a surprising take Sunday on the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and its media coverage.

The 1619 Project author commented on a local writer’s description of ""incidents of insidious racism"" in the media, claiming that concern is only for ""Europeans with blond hair and blue eyes.""

UKRANIAN MOTHER CAPTURES THE SPIRIT OF RESISTANCE AND RESILIENCE AMID RUSSIAN INVASION: ‘WE ARE UNITED’

Hannah-Jones agreed with the writer on the ""racialized"" analysis.

""Every journalist covering Ukraine should really, really look internally. This is why I say we should stop pretending we have objectivity and in instead acknowledge our biases so that we can report against them. Many of us see the racialized analysis and language,"" Hannah-Jones tweeted.

She also added that the ""admissions of shock"" for Ukraine suggest a racial bias due to a lack of attention for nonwhite nations.

""And honestly, these admissions of shock that this is happening in a European country are ahistorical and also serve to justify the lack of sympathy for other invasions, other occupations and other refugee crisis [sic] involving peoples not considered white,"" Hannah-Jones added.

When a Twitter user criticized her take as well as its timing, she responded, ""That’s absolutely ridiculous. Journalists shouldn’t focus on improving their coverage in real time?""

She followed up with an additional tweet that it was ""a geopolitical fiction to separate [Europe] from Asia"" so that an invasion can be ""a dog whistle to tell us we should care because they are like us.""

WAPO SLAMMED FOR HEADLINE SAYING ‘ECONOMY APPEARED READY TO SURGE,’ RUSSIAN INVASION ‘COULD SEND SHOCKWAVES’

Still, she insisted, ""To be clear: We should care about Ukraine. But not because it is European, or the people appear white, or they are ‘civilized’ and not ‘impoverished.’ All people deserve to be free and to be welcomed when their countries are at war.""

Hannah-Jones has frequently made controversial claims on her Twitter account, sometimes deleting them later. Her 1619 Project was also heavily criticized as a distorted and inaccurate depiction of history despite earning Hannah-Jones a Pulitzer Prize for her work.

284,Ukraine battles Russian forces: LIVE UPDATES,Posted Lawrence Richard,"Russians enter Kharkiv, Ukraine’s No. 2 city, as fighting broadens: reports

Fighting got underway Sunday in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, after Russian forces stormed in from the outskirts, according to reports.

The Kharkiv offensive combined with overnight strikes in Kyiv and other parts of the country to broaden the Russian invasion that began Thursday, the reports said.

Kharkiv, located about 480 miles east of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, lies just a little more than 12 miles from the Russian border.

The city’s population is about 1.4 million, or about half the size of Kyiv, the BBC reported.

Russian troops began approaching Kharkiv on Thursday, when the invasion into Ukraine got underway, but remained outside the city until Sunday, The Associated Press reported.

Oleh Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said Ukrainian fighters were engaged against Russians inside the city, and civilians were being asked to stay in their homes, the AP reported.

Videos posted on social media showed Russian military vehicles on the streets of Kharkiv and showed at least one residential building heavily damaged by shelling.

An elderly woman was killed at the site but about 60 other residents were said to be unharmed after taking refuge in the basement, the BBC reported.

292,"Putin sends Chechen fighters to Ukraine, with results unclear",Ben Evansky,"

Vladimir Putin’s move to send the battle-hardened and much-feared Chechen fighters to reinforce his invasion into Ukraine might have initially backfired, according to reports coming out of Ukraine.

Observers said the soldiers could have been sent in as headhunters to kill or capture senior Ukrainian politicians, but they say those initial efforts have been thwarted by Ukraine’s military.

The Chechens are part of a Russian national guard unit and are well known for fighting insurgencies, using brutal tactics that even jolted Russia during its two brutal wars in the '90s against them. The Chechens have been employed to hunt down terrorists in Syria and used by Russia to fight elsewhere, including in Georgia. They also fought the Ukrainians in Donbas when hostilities began there in 2014.

The Chechen Republic is a predominantly Muslim region in the Caucuses, and while it's still part of Russia, it has been granted a lot of autonomy by Putin, who is close to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov announced this weekend that his troops were in Ukraine.

Reports on their number varied from 7,000 to tens of thousands. Kadyrov said he supported Putin’s decision to invade and that his troops, ""will carry out his orders under any circumstances,"" Reuters reported. He also claimed none of his troops have died or suffered injuries, according to Reuters.

Yet, unconfirmed reports coming out of Kyiv claimed Ukrainian forces had taken out some 56 Chechen tanks and killed one of its high-ranking commanders on the way to the capital. While the Chechen leader denied his commander’s death, if true, observers said, even this early on in the campaign it could be a problem for Putin, given the massive fight of resistance being put on by Ukrainian military forces against the Russian aggressor.

Theodore Karasik, a fellow on Russia and Middle East affairs at the Jamestown Foundation, told Fox News Digital, ""The Chechens are getting hit for now, and it’s based on the fact that they [the Ukrainians] did their homework. They understood how Chechens fight.""

Karasik said even with the Chechens’ historic background of being lethal fighters on the battleground, during these early stages of the invasion, ""instead of the Chechens targeting them, (the Ukrainians) have targeted the Chechens. They got them before they had time to really act. That doesn’t mean the Chechen units are inactive, but they are getting slowed down tremendously in these first few days.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Karasik, who has written a book on Russia's actions in the Middle East, as well as on the Chechen conflict with Russia, said he saw these reports as adding to the anxiety of the Russian general staff. ""When [Sergei] Shoygu, the defense minister, has to go sit with Putin at a distance because Kadyrov was mouthing off and whining that they're getting their a--es kicked, this will send a shock wave about a response. So, this is why I think we're seeing a bigger aggression by Russia.""

""We are only in day 5, and the Chechens got surprised because of Kadyrov’s relationship with the Kremlin. This looks bad for him. So, his highly trained fighters, some of whom have trained in other theaters, have to go back and fight harder, and Putin knows that,"" Karasik said.

As the Ukrainian military is fighting to keep control of Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, observers expected to see the Chechen units moving in with them. Karasik warned that some of the Chechens likely will be assigned to ""a 'kidnap and kill' portion, since they have had a history of doing these types of operations.""

RUSSIA REPORTEDLY SENDS HUNDREDS OF MERCENARIES TO KYIV

Global affairs analyst Jonathan Wachtel, who as a journalist based in Moscow in the ‘90s, covered conflicts in the former Soviet Union, including Chechnya, told Fox News Digital that maybe one reason Putin sent the Chechens in so early on in the fighting was to boost the morale of the troops, given the heavy losses they’re taking.

Military service is compulsory in Russia, so many conscripts may not have the will to fight, particularly against people who are predominantly ethnic Slavs following similar cultures. Having the feared Chechen fighters in the arena might shake things up at this early stage.

""As fighters, they have a reputation that goes back centuries of being ferocious and instilling fear among invading armies that tried and failed to crush them. So, you end up with Chechen characters in novels by Tolstoy and Pushkin, some of the great literary giants of Russian literature, and this fear of the Chechens fighter is not for nothing,"" Wachtel said.

He continued, ""They're known for being extremely capable in battle, strategically shrewd, cunning, relentless and vicious -- they fight to the death even when they know that they are outnumbered.""

Wachtel, who worked under U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Kelly Craft, said when Putin came to power, he crushed Grozny, the capital city of Chechnya, and launched a ruthless military campaign, but the Chechens ran a ferocious counterinsurgency and acts of terrorism against civilian targets that caused the Russians plenty of problems.

He said while it seemed an unusual relationship between Putin and Kadyrov, the Russian president ""managed to work out a relationship with him and his fighters to have loyalty where they can maintain leadership of the region of Chechnya in exchange for Russian financial and infrastructure support.""

Wachtel concluded, ""In this fashion, and as ironic as it is, given the tangled and violent history between Russians and Chechens, he is essentially in Putin's pocket and that’s because it is helpful to him as well, he maintains power and control and ensures that his people are getting the support they need.""

The airspace over Ukraine is still being contested as Ukrainian forces continue to fight back against the Russian invasion, according to a senior U.S. defense official on Sunday.

""That means that the Ukrainians are still using both aircraft, and their own air and missile defense systems, which we believe are still intact and still viable,"" said the official in an off-camera press briefing released by the Department of Defense. ""Though they have been, as I said yesterday, there's been some degradation by the Russians.""

Roughly two-thirds of Russian forces located along the border have now been committed inside Ukraine, an increase from 24 hours earlier when about half of those forces were committed inside the country, the official said.

UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES

The Russian momentum during the invasion has slowed, and there was no indication that the Russian military has taken control of any major cities in Ukraine, despite that being their goal, the official said.

Russia is continuing to advance in three major ""axes"" of Ukraine since beginning an invasion early Thursday.

But the Russian forces continue to face stiff resistance from Ukraine, along with fuel and logistics shortages in their advance on Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city located near the border with Russia in the east.

""We believe that their advance was slowed both by resistance by the Ukrainians who have been quite creative in finding ways to attack columns, and number two, by the fuel source shortages and the sustainment issues that they have had,"" the official said.

Russian forces remain about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the city center in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Despite their recent shortcomings, the official warned the Russians still had an ""awful lot of combat power, that is viable and arrayed in and outside Ukraine.""

Some reconnaissance elements were in Kyiv in recent days, with reports indicating that they were wearing Ukrainian uniforms to disguise themselves.

UKRAINIANS BRAVELY ‘PLAYING FOR TIME’

""But they have been in some cases identified by locals, and by the Ukrainian military, again, right out of the Russian playbook here,"" the official said.

In the south, Russian forces were moving northeast and were within about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the city center of Mariupol.

""Our assessment is that Mariupol is defended. And the Ukrainians will put up a resistance there,"" the official stated.

Russia has launched more than 320 missiles during the invasion, with the majority of them being short-range ballistic missiles.

There are also indications that the Russians are adopting siege tactics around the city of Chernihiv, which sits to the northeast of Kyiv, the official said.

The next 24 hours were crucial for Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a telephone call with United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday, according to Reuters.

As for Vladimir Putin, the official didn't doubt reports that indicated the Russian president placed his country's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.

""We have no reason to doubt the validity of these reports,"" the official said, calling the step by Putin ""unnecessary"" and ""escalatory.""

299,"Republican bill would allow US citizens to seize yachts, planes of Russian oligarchs amid Ukraine invasion",Brooke Singman,"

FIRST ON FOX: Texas Republican Rep. Lance Gooden is expected to roll out a measure Monday that would allow private U.S. citizens to seize yachts, planes or other property belonging to sanctioned Russian citizens amid Russia's war on Ukraine.

Gooden would do it with legislation requiring President Biden to issue letters of marque and reprisal, an enumerated power of Congress mentioned in Article 1 of the Constitution, which were routinely used during the War of 1812 for Americans to seize property on behalf of the U.S. government, but have not been issued since.

""Putin and his inner circle still have yachts and planes sitting in harbors and airports all over the world,"" Gooden told Fox News Digital. ""The United States must use every tool at our disposal to seize them and hold Russia accountable for the disgusting invasion of Ukraine. The oligarchs who enabled this crisis are a good place to start.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

The letters can also be used in cyberspace, according to Gooden’s office, to authorize non-government U.S. hackers to go after specific state actors.

But Gooden told Fox News that letters of marque and reprisal have also been cited as a congressional tool to ""check"" a president who ""lacks initiatives to achieve Congress’ objectives on his own.""

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND US ALLIES AIM TO SEIZE RUSSIAN YACHTS AND MANSIONS

Gooden’s office told Fox News that Biden, at this time, is ""not acting swiftly enough to seize the property of Russian oligarchs.""

The Biden administration and U.S. allies announced on Saturday a fresh round of sanctions against Russia that would not only target the banking system, but the physical assets of sanctioned oligarchs – including their yachts and mansions.

The U.S. and its partners said in a joint statement on Saturday that they'll form a transatlantic task force to hunt down and freeze the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies within their jurisdictions.

""We’ll go after their yachts, their luxury apartments, their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the West,"" a senior administration official said about the new crackdown.

The commitment came from the U.S., European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada as part of their larger announcement to expel certain Russian banks from the SWIFT financial system and to sanction the Russian Central Bank.

""We're disarming fortress Russia by taking this action,"" the official added.

300,Senate votes to block Democrat bill enshrining abortion as Supreme Court reconsiders Roe v. Wade,Tyler O'Neil,"

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., joined his Republican Senate colleagues in voting to block a bill to protect abortion rights as the Supreme Court reconsiders Roe v. Wade (1973) this term.

The Senate voted 46-48 on whether to bring the bill up for debate, with six senators not voting.

H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act, aims ""to protect a person’s ability to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a health care provider’s ability to provide abortion services.""

71% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS: POLL

Every Senate Democrat except Manchin and Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., cosponsored the legislation. Casey voted in favor of debate on the legislation. The House voted 218-211 in favor of the bill, with every Democrat except Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, supporting it or not voting, and every Republican opposing it or not voting.

The bill stipulates that ""a health care provider has a statutory right under this Act to provide abortion services, and may provide abortion services, and that provider’s patient has a corresponding right to receive such services, without"" specific ""limitations or requirements.""

The bill would strike down any ""prohibition on abortion at any point or points in time prior to fetal viability, including a prohibition or restriction on a particular abortion procedure."" It would also invalidate any state law prohibiting ""abortion after fetal viability when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health.""

The bill also claims that abortion rights qualifies as ""reproductive justice"" seeking to address ""systems of oppression, lack of bodily autonomy, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism."" While the bill claims that abortion restrictions ""are a tool of gender oppression,"" it also clarifies that despite using ""the terms ‘woman’ and ‘women,’"" legislators intend to ""protect all people with the capacity for pregnancy—cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, those who identify with a different gender, and others—who are unjustly harmed by restrictions on abortion services.""

PRO-LIFE ADVOCATES RIP KAMALA HARRIS' PREDICTION THAT ‘WOMEN WILL DIE’ IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED

""Sadly it looks like the Supreme Court will limit abortion rights on the coming months. That’s why the bill is essential,"" Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said before the vote. ""Congress must codify into law what most Americans have long believed, that abortion is a fundamental right and that women's decisions over women's health care belong to women, not – NOT – to extremist right-wing legislatures.""

""With a cascade of major crises testing our country, Senate Democrats are prioritizing a show-vote on mandating 9 months of abortion-on-demand across America,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. ""Senate Democrats want to go on record supporting the radical and massively unpopular position that we should have functionally no restrictions on abortion whatsoever.""

""Tonight, the hard-left formally kicked the old slogan of ‘safe, legal, and rare’ to the curb and embraced extreme pro-abortion politics,"" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement. ""This legislation will make Planned Parenthood's army of lobbyists happy, but it's going to alienate a lot of Americans.""

Polling on abortion is mixed. A Fox News Poll in Sept. 2021 found that 65% of Americans support keeping Roe v. Wade, a Knights of Columbus/Marist poll in Jan. found that most Americans (60%) would either have the Court make abortion illegal (17%) or have the issue determined by each state (44%), both positions that would involve overturning Roe.

CHRISTIANS FROM DIFFERENT RACES, DENOMINATIONS AND PARTIES GATHER TO PRAY BEFORE SUPREME COURT ABORTION CASE

The Marist poll presented six options on abortion restrictions: ""abortion should be available to a woman at any time she wants one during her entire pregnancy""; ""abortion should be allowed only during the first six months of a pregnancy""; ""abortion should be allowed only during the first three months of a pregnancy""; ""abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother""; ""abortion should be allowed only to save the life of the mother""; and ""abortion should never be permitted under any circumstance.""

Most Americans (71%) said that abortion should be restricted to the first three months of pregnancy (22%) or in other limited circumstances such as rape and incest (28%), to save the life of the mother (9%) or not at all (12%). Only 17% of Americans said abortion should be available during an entire pregnancy and 12% said it should be restricted to the first six months.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony List, warned that ""those who sided with the abortion lobby to trample the will of the people will face political consequences."" Several Democrats up for reelection in swing states voted for the bill, including Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev.

Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson called votes against the bill ""unconscionable.""

Russia state media prematurely declared victory, hailed 'new world' in now-deleted report Russian state-aligned media outlet RIA posted and deleted an article over the weekend that hailed Vladimir Putin for victory over Ukraine as Russia helps usher in a supposed ""new world."" In what some have already labeled an ""embarrassing and revealing"" mistake, RIA pushed the article out and quickly deleted it. The article carries a date and timestamp of Feb. 26 at 8 a.m. and remains web-archived and available via the WayBack Machine to read in full. The report starts off by underscoring the victory as ""restoring"" Russia’s unity, not just geographically returning the country to its historical borders and reversing ""the tragedy of 1991,"" but also hailing the country’s ability to overcome ""temporary division.""

Breaking News US has ‘no argument’ to make no-fly zone over Ukraine: ‘just not going to happen’ A senior U.S. defense official told Fox News that President Biden has ruled out setting up a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The current stance holds that a no-fly zone would mean the U.S. had entered the conflict, which Biden has said is not on the table. “The President had been clear that US troops, US forces will not be used inside Ukraine,” the official said. But the official added that the Russian convoy has made “no appreciable movement” towards Kyiv, and soldiers are running out of food. The official said there is “no reason to doubt” reports that Russian soldiers are also punching holes in their own fuel tanks to stop their vehicles advancing.

Russian troops stalled north of Kyiv, running out of gas and food: US official Russian combat forces north of Kyiv have not advanced since Monday and have been running out of food and gas, a senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday. More than 80% of the pre-staged Russian combat power is now inside Ukraine, the official said. The official added that the ""stall"" north of Kyiv is due in part to tough Ukrainian resistance and ""fuel and sustainment problems."" The lack of advance could also be a result of Russia regrouping, rethinking or reevaluating their strategy, the official said. A ""significant number"" of Russian troops are conscripts, the official said, describing them as ""very young men drafted into service"" who may not have been fully trained or aware that they would be participating in combat operations. The U.S. is picking up indications that morale is flagging in some of these units, the defense official added. But Russia has made some gains in the southern part of Ukraine after occupying Malitopol and Berdyansk. Fox News' Peter Aitken contributed to this report. Posted by Paul Conner Share

308,Tucker: Defense of Ukraine's democracy has led to an erosion of our own,Tucker Carlson,"

No sane American approves of what Russia has done in Ukraine. We certainly don't and we don't know anyone who does.

On Twitter, you see Democrats pretending that their political opponents are responsible for the invasion and somehow support it. So, Joe Biden and his staff so mismanaged the world that Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine after Biden told us for months he could prevent that from happening, and yet all of it is your fault. So, that's a slanderous lie.

In this country, virtually everyone understands that the invasion of Ukraine is bad. It's bad for us and for the world and Vladimir Putin is bad too. So, effectively in America, those are settled facts. We can stop debating them. The question is: What do we do next? Vladimir Putin's badness doesn't absolve us of our responsibility to think clearly about how to protect this country and the rest of the free world, in that order.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In fact, Putin's badness makes wise decision-making in the United States more important than ever and yet at the same time, it makes wise decision-making harder to achieve. It's not easy to see the long view when you're angry. A writer called Tanner Greer wrote a piece this morning, which you should read. It's entitled, ""Pausing at the Precipice."" Greer began by pointing out that Russia has obviously earned our content. Most Americans now despise Vladimir Putin, and that's understandable. They're outraged, but moral outrage is not enough. Moral outrage is not a foreign policy.

In fact, Greer writes, moral outrage can be counterproductive. It's clarifying, but here's the downside. ""A righteous reaction may be a dangerous one...In the field of power politics, it is outcomes, not intentions, that matter most. Failure to slow down and examine the assumptions and motivations behind our choices may lead to decisions that feel right in the moment, but fail to safeguard our interests, secure our values, or reduce the human toll of war in the long run.""

Exactly. Nicely put. Another way to express it would be this: Our leaders could easily turn this tragic and volatile moment into a historic disaster. They've done it before. As of tonight, here are the two main things we ought to be worried about going forward: First, and most obviously, this war could get much worse than it already is. We could see many Americans die.

Joe Biden is telling us he will not commit American troops to Ukraine. Biden also claimed he opposed vaccine mandates. So is he telling the truth? Even if he is telling the truth about his intentions in this case, Biden can't see the future. Biden has no idea what will happen tomorrow or next week, much less next year. Nobody does.

We do know that already many in Washington are pushing for a hot war with nuclear-armed Russia. They're demanding a no-fly zone over Ukraine. That means American forces would shoot down Russian jets in Ukrainian airspace and also take out radar installations and other facilities within Russia itself. Not surprisingly, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on board with this. Why wouldn't he be? He's asked Joe Biden for an American-enforced no-fly zone, but as we said, many in Congress are for it, too. Here's Adam Kinzinger:

REP. ADAM KINZINGER: I think this is time where we need to, at the invitation of Ukraine, declare Ukraine a no-fly zone enforced by NATO and the United States. We certainly have the capability to do that. The airspace is still contested by the Ukrainians and we could certainly shut down Russian air operations even if we don't directly engage Russian troops on the ground.

IN LA’S EASTERN EUROPEAN DIASPORA, SOLIDARITY FOR UKRAINE

""We can shut down Russian air operations even if we don't directly engage Russian troops on the ground."" So that's a lie. It's hard to overstate how dishonest Kinzinger's claim is. Shooting down Russian planes and taking out radar installations would, by definition, entail engaging Russian troops. If Vladimir Putin is even half as evil and crazy as they tell us he is, and he may be, that could easily spiral into nuclear conflict.

So, you would only suggest that if you had nothing to lose, and Adam Kinzinger, of course, he doesn't. His political career is over. He's disgraced. He has literally nothing to lose. But many of us have a lot to lose—our country. We have children. So, we should pause before we do that, but no pausing allowed.

Adam Kinzinger thinks you're a traitor if you're worried about where this might go. ""This breathlessness over nukes is mind-blowing,"" Kinzinger wrote over the weekend— nothing bad will happen. And maybe nothing bad will happen, but something very bad could happen, and it could happen fast.

Adults know that. Anyone with experience knows that. Watch any war in history. And yet tonight, amazingly some of those adults, and they are adults, favor this anyway. Two former Supreme allied commanders of NATO, Wes Clark and Philip Breedlove are pushing for armed confrontation with the Russian military.

In an interview with Foreign Policy Magazine, Breedlove was honest enough to acknowledge that a no-fly zone would amount to ""an act of war,"" and it would. Thank you for saying so out loud, but Breedlove said he's for it anyway. OK, so this is the moment when a functioning news media would step in and start to ask basic questions about what happens next. War with Russia, fine.

What does that mean, exactly? How far is the United States and its population, who would fight that war, prepared to take this conflict and to what end? Once we start bombing Russia, will Putin withdraw his forces from Ukraine? What will be left of Ukraine by that point? How are we sure that Putin, who we say is deranged, won't go nuclear if a war with him begins? And then, among many other questions, what will China's role in this war be?

Thanks to the efforts of the Biden White House, China is now Vladimir Putin's strongest ally. The Chinese have just signed a long-term energy deal with Russia. They now have skin in the game. Russia will be powering China's economy going forward. Good job, Biden White House. But because that's true, how sure we that the Chinese will stay out of a war?

UKRAINE GIVES BIDEN ‘OPPORTUNITY’ TO ‘REBOOT’ PRESIDENCY DURING SOTU, ACCORDING TO MEDIA

How do we know they won't take down our digital infrastructure, which they seem to some great extent to control in this country… etc? You can think of many questions, but reporters aren't asking any of them. Asking questions is now immoral. Richard Engel, who knows better, he's the chief foreign correspondent at NBC, is now demanding that American troops fight the Russian army. It's a moral imperative.

""A massive Russian convoy is about 30 miles from Kyiv, the US/NATO could likely destroy it, but that would be direct involvement against Russia and risk everything. Does the West watch in silence as it rolls?""

And of course, the answer is implied. We can't watch in silence. That would be immoral. If you're a good person, you will support a war that could very easily turn into a nuclear conflict. Again, this is moral blackmail. No one in America takes pride at the sight, feels anything but revulsion at the sight, of Russian troops within Ukraine. It's wrong. It's destabilizing to the world. It is, in fact, against our values, but how we respond is the question. Thoughtfully, has to be the answer unless we're prepared to risk massive consequences.

Now Richard Haass, who is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, would under normal circumstances, be exactly the man you would go to for a wise and reasoned perspective on what to do next. That's his job. Whatever you think of the Council on Foreign Relations, and we don't think much, they're not a radical organization. Their job is to think through the consequences of action. But not anymore. Richard Haass is foursquare in favor of a hot war with Russia. He's calling for ""regime change in Moscow"" because no doubt they'll greet us as liberators. What could go wrong? Here's Richard Haass:

RICHARD HAASS: We need now a response of necessity to his war of choice and there's got to be to raise the economic costs at home, to raise the military costs on the ground. I hate to be so blunt, but the most vulnerable thing that...Putin's vulnerable to is dead Russian soldiers. So, we have to make sure Ukraine has the means to...resist.

When did a guy that irresponsible take over the Council on Foreign Relations? And of course, that's not his real job, the Council on Foreign Relations, his real job is being a cable news pundit, and that's kind of the problem with the level of discourse around this war. The problem is that when real people with jobs that convey actual authority start talking like cable news guests, things could go sideways very fast. ""Dead Russian soldiers.""

BIDEN STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: WHAT LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WANT TO HEAR

So it's hardly a defense of Vladimir Putin to point out once again that a shooting war with Russia could have massive consequences for us because it's not just Russian soldiers who would die. Americans would die too, potentially many of them. And, by the way, it's not all certain we would win that war. Sorry, it's not. Ask anyone who's familiar with the current state of readiness of the U.S. military. Is victory a foregone conclusion? Is this the roll into Baghdad? No, it's not. This is not Saddam Hussein we're talking about.

So again, the point is, are we ready for all of this? We're moving down a path that could result in the destruction of the United States. Americans may be mad at Putin, understandably, but they're wary of where our leaders are taking this next. A new CNN poll, for example, shows a strong majority of Americans, speaking of democracy, oppose direct military action against Russia. Are they all traitors? Are they all pro-Putin? Probably not.

At the very least, they would like, and we could use, a sober national conversation about the potential consequences of where people like Richard Haass are taking us now. That's the opposite of what we're getting. Instead, we're getting buffoons like Adam Kinzinger sitting in his office making bellicose noises on social media. Just the other day, Kinzinger posted images on Twitter of Ukrainian Air Ace called the Ghost of Kyiv. He downed Russian MiGs left and right.

Well, turns out the whole thing was a hoax, but of course, Adam Kinzinger had no idea because he knows nothing. ""The #ghostofKyiv has a name and he has absolutely owned the Russian Air Force,"" he tweeted. Imagine a sitting member of Congress tweeting about a war like it's a cable news segment.

""He absolutely owned the Russian Air Force."" Really? Get some respect. People are dying, buffoon. Kinzinger then attached an obviously photoshopped image of the comedian, Sam Hyde, sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet. Sam Hyde, for the record, is not a Ukrainian fighter...he is, once again, a comedian. That was Adam Kinzinger. These are the people pushing us toward a new world war.

So, at the very least, let's pause and think this through. That seems fair and as we do that, it is also worth considering what's happening here in the United States, concurrent with this war and justified by this war and by that, we are speaking of the assault on civil liberties now underway. It would be ironic if a defense of democracy, on the other side of the world, led to an erosion of democracy here and yet that seems to be where we're heading.

NYT CLAIMS BIDEN ‘REDEFINING THE ARC OF HIS PRESIDENCY,’ GIVES POSITIVE REVIEW FOR HANDLING OF RUSSIA, SCOTUS

You'll notice that the moment that Russian troops rolled across the border into Ukraine, Democrats wasted no time in attacking not just Putin, but their political opponents in this country. What did they have to do with it? Isn't war the moment for unity? We're all in this together, but they leverage this war and the human suffering that inevitably entails to make partisan points.

One MSNBC regular, in one of the stranger moments you'll see on television (MSNBC has had a lot of those recently) said the whole conflict was the result of a plot engineered by Vladimir Putin's mole, who happened to be the former president of the United States.

SARAH KENDZIOR, PHD: Trump was installed as the president of the United States in order to weaken the alliances that were preventing Putin from achieving his goals— alliances like NATO, our relationship with our European partners, our relationship with Ukraine. Trump was put in as a bulldozer.

OK, so we spent maybe three years holding up the lunacy of the Russiagate people and the lying as evidence that maybe they shouldn't have a meaningful effect on our national conversation about politics and yet somehow, through a very unfortunate confluence of events, those very same unbalanced people are now having a measurable effect on our foreign policy and if you think we're overstating the lunacy, try to follow the logic here. This is what she just told us.

So Donald Trump, that would be Putin's man in the White House, tells Europe not to become dependent upon Russian oil, as he did, and to pay more for their own military defense, which he also did and was scoffed at, by the way. And yet, for some reason, Putin then waits to invade Ukraine until his man in the White House is gone and playing golf in Florida and now it is Donald Trump's fault that Europe is dependent on Russia for energy. It was all part of Putin's plan. Republicans wanted this to happen all along.

You can imagine MSNBC viewers, the ones sat through years of this, nodding along ""yes."" Now the pee tape makes sense. What's scary about this is that it's not confined to MSNBC. The overlap between MSNBC guests shouting nonsensical partisan talking points and true conspiracy theories and Democratic policy-makers is profound. So Democratic lawmakers now pretending there's a large and dangerous fifth column in the United States working for Vladimir Putin, which there is not. And as always, they're talking about themselves.

Eric Swalwell, for example, he recently took the maximum possible campaign donation from a lobbyist for Nord Stream 2 AG. Now that's the company making the pipeline that will give Russia greater control over Europe's energy grid and from which the Russian government profits.

So. Eric Swalwell is taking money from the Russians and by the way, this is a guy who had sex with a Chinese spy. Has he had sex with Russian spies? We don't know, but you'll notice the one guy who probably shouldn't be calling other people traitors, as he takes money from Russian energy interests, is whipping around and accusing everyone else of rooting for the Russians.

ERIC SWALWELL: We have Republicans who are rooting for Russia and that makes it very hard for President Biden to get the whole country to go along when Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and Tucker Carlson are rooting for Russians and that's being replayed on Russia TV to rally Russians for this cause.

You know, it's such an awful thing to say. We hesitated even to play that. It's very common. You hear it every day. The question is: Why are they saying that? It doesn't make sense, but it makes political sense. It is an effort to cover their own tracks. Our Foreign policy establishment failed to constrain Vladimir Putin.

To bring you back to ancient history like a week ago, they were telling us that sanctions and arming the Ukrainian military would prevent a Russian invasion. Now, they were wrong about that. They've been wrong many times, most recently in Afghanistan and in fact, now that we're casting blame, if there is any single American who deserves scorn and yes, blame for the invasion of Ukraine, it would be Joe Biden.

Of course, it was his job, self-described job, to prevent it. But of course, they won't admit that. Instead, they're attacking you and they're doing it with partisan goals in mind. Democrats plan to use the Ukraine invasion, this would become very obvious in the last three days, in the very same way they used January 6th.

So bad event takes place. No one really is for it. No one defended the riot on January 6th. We certainly didn't. But history is written immediately for partisan ends. So then you take the hysteria ginned up over that event, some of it legitimate, by the way, people have a right to be upset, and you use that to purge the country of the Democratic Party's political opponents.

So what do they really hate? Well, listen to them. They hate populist politics. They hate populist politics in this country far more than they hate Vladimir Putin. So they're using this opportunity, this war in Eastern Europe, to shut down domestic dissent in the United States and you're seeing it as always in our allies first.

BUCK SEXTON: BIDEN’S ‘HOSTILITY’ TO ENERGY PRODUCTION WEAKENED US POSITION AGAINST RUSSIAN INVASION

Several of them, including Canada, have banned journalists who don't agree with their view of the war. Again, if we're going to protect democracy, that should start at home and democracy is defined, literally defined, by the tolerance of the regime for dissent. But no dissent is allowed. So they've pulled RT off the airwaves in Canada, we did that long ago, and that led Mother Jones Magazine to ask this question today:

""Both RT and Sputnik air in the United States, too."" Untrue, but whatever they don't know. ""Will Biden follow suit and crackdown on pro-Russia disinformation? If he does, U.S. cable companies will also need to scrutinize media outlets like Fox News, whose shows— Tucker Carlson's in particular— have parodied pro-Russia talking points."".

OK, so Putin invades Ukraine, self-evidently a tragedy bad for the United States, and we're using that as a justification because we care so much about democracy to shut down any news organization, any journalist who questions the Democratic Party? OK. How did we get here anyway? How corroded have these people become that they're calling for government censorship of dissent and telling us their defenders of democracy? That's just the beginning. Anyone who supports voter I.D. laws is a Kremlin agent, too. You're seeing how they're going to use this? Here's Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee to explain:

SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI: We talked about the fact that the invasion, the assault on Ukraine, was an assault on democracy. Barbara took the time to talk about assaults on our democracy in our own country.

REP. BARBARA LEE: The fight for democracy is taking place throughout the world. It's not only in Ukraine, but it's in our own country, and we've seen this through the campaigns of misinformation and disinformation. We see this happening in Ukraine. The fact that now we see those at times take away the voting rights of people of color, of African-Americans, of young people, of seniors, of the disabled.

You know, it's not even worth parsing the logic of something like that. You can only feel deep sadness that the people you just saw represent you in our Legislature, but by the way, as long as we're punishing people who are allied with hostile foreign interests, just to restate the obvious, China is now Russia's strongest ally in this war and that has real implications for people like, I don't know Nancy Pelosi, whose family has gotten rich from China or the entire American financial sector, or Hollywood, or all the people who are now profiting from Vladimir Putin's closest ally . Will they divest of those investments?

We'll see. But in the meantime, you should be very aware that there are partisan forces trying to use the war in Ukraine to accomplish political objectives here domestically and gain more power for themselves. It's not just about voting rights or shutting down Fox News.

RUSSIA COMPLAINS TO US AND CANADA ABOUT UKRAINE PROTESTS NEAR EMBASSIES

It's about shutting you up personally, your ability to express yourself and if you doubt that, you should know that Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia just wrote a letter to his donors, the tech monopolies demanding that they, ""restrict the spread of Russian propaganda.""

He did not define the term ""Russian propaganda"" and as a show that has been accused of disseminating it repeatedly, we can tell you we're all sensitive on the topic and you should be too. So, Warner went on television recently to report that his donors and Big Tech quickly complied with his demand.

DAVID IGNATIUS: You sent letters on Friday to our leading social media companies: Meta, which runs Facebook, Alphabet, Reddit, asking them to take action to prevent Russian state media, Russian propaganda operations, from appearing on their platforms. When I ask, have you received any responses yet to your request that they take that action?

SEN MARK WARNER: Well, David, the short answer is yes. Virtually every one of these platforms has taken down some of the Russian activity or demonetized, so they're not making money off of RT or Russian ads on real time during the platforms. That's good. I commend these...platforms.

So, contrast that with MSNBC. MSNBC is when dumb people do propaganda and tell you that Russia invading Ukraine is somehow about racism in the American South or something. I mean, it's nonsensical.

Sen. Mark Warner is when smart people do propaganda. You'll notice that Ignatius said Russian state media or Russian propaganda. To just be completely clear, Warner is not talking about banning Russian state media. He's talking about banning Russian propaganda, a term that he gets to define. He's talking about censoring the opinions of Americans.

Now, to be clear, that is not allowed in a democracy. In a democracy, citizens who rule have an absolute right to have any opinion they want. Period. That's not an ancillary freedom. That's not just some random thing that we have as an added bonus as Americans.

That freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, is the central freedom we have. It's the whole point of the country and there is no point in supporting Ukraine if our leaders ignore our own bill of rights, and we should demand that they respect our Bill of Rights before they take a single step forward in defense of any other democracy. Period.

313,Ukraine claims Russia used an illegal vacuum bomb during invasion: 'Potentially a war crime',Lawrence Richard,"

The International Criminal Court has started investigating Russia over potential war crimes the country may have committed during its invasion of Ukraine, after a Ukrainian official claimed that Russia used an illegal weapon during the war, officials said.

On Monday, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the former country used a vacuum bomb, in violation of international law, Reuters reported.

""They used the vacuum bomb today,"" Markarova said outside a closed congressional hearing where committee members received an intelligence briefing on the war. ""The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.""

That same day, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, who was already investigating ahead of the invasion, said he was opening an investigation ""as rapidly as possible"" into any other potential violations, ABC News reported.

A vacuum bomb is a thermobaric weapon that is typically more devastating than traditional bombs as it absorbs the oxygen in a given space to cause a significant blast capable of vaporizing humans, Reuters reported.

A Russian vehicle capable of carrying thermobaric weaponry was spotted traveling in Ukraine, CNN reported, but there is no official determination that such a weapon was used.

314,"State of the Union: World on edge, US economy teetering, Biden to make most consequential speech of his life",Jessica Chasmar,"

President Biden will give his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, marking the most consequential speech of his lifetime as U.S. inflation soars and Eastern Europe devolves into war.

While State of the Union speeches tend to concentrate on domestic issues, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine despite Biden’s repeated threats of economic sanctions has brought the U.S. president’s foreign policy agenda into central focus.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Post-Cold War order on verge of collapse

Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert Sunday after the U.S. and other Western nations announced that they would remove selected Russian banks from the SWIFT international financial messaging system. It’s the latest measure taken against Russia after initial economic sanctions failed to deter Putin from invading Ukraine as the Biden administration had hoped.

During his speech Tuesday, the president is expected to champion the sanctions and his own efforts in building a ""global coalition to fight against the autocracy"" of the Kremlin, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday.

""If you look back when President [Barack] Obama gave his first State of the Union, it was during the worst financial crisis in a generation,"" Psaki said. ""When President [George W.] Bush gave his first State of the Union, it was shortly after 9/11. Leaders lead during crises. That’s exactly what President Biden is doing.""

Republican lawmakers mused at the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference that the speech likely had to be rewritten.

""I think they've probably torn up the draft they had for the State of the Union and are realizing that issues are getting away from them,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital at CPAC.

GOP LAWMAKERS PREDICT WHAT'S IN BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS: ‘PROBABLY TORN UP THE DRAFT THEY HAD’

""And that they're going to need to buckle down and do some hard work on these foreign policy issues. We've got a lot of countries now that are very upset with the U.S. because we've appeared weak and indecisive about how we were going to move forward against aggressors.""

Dr. James Anderson, the former deputy undersecretary for policy at the Department of Defense, told Fox News Digital on Monday that Biden should use his speech to lay out ""additional measures"" to be taken against Russia, such as expelling more diplomats and banning Aeroflot flights from entering U.S. airspace.

Putin will be ""looking closely at what President Biden says,"" Anderson said.

Rising inflation, sinking approval ratings

The economy is also a key issue for Biden’s State of the Union address as inflation reaches a 40-year high and gasoline prices hit their highest level in eight years. Biden has warned that his sanctions against Russia could drive up gas prices even more, which could further impact his approval ratings, where the overwhelming majority of voters say skyrocketing grocery and energy prices are causing them financial hardship, according to a new Fox News Poll.

That same poll put Biden’s approval rating at a dismal 43%, the lowest of this presidency, and only 37% approve of his handling of the economy.

When Biden delivered his first joint address to Congress last April, which is different from the State of the Union, he focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and spoke to masked Congress members in a limited-capacity House chamber. This year, the president may declare a victory over the virus as new cases and hospitalizations continue to plunge across the country, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased its indoor mask guidance.

In contrast to last year, all Congress members were invited to attend Biden’s address Tuesday and masks are optional.

Biden will also celebrate his new Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who will be the first Black woman to serve on the nation’s highest court if confirmed.

Stalled legislative agenda

As far as his legislative agenda, Biden is expected to tout his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but his landmark proposals for ""Build Back Better"" and voting rights bills have failed to make any progress.

Biden is expected to avoid using the phrase ""Build Back Better"" in his State of the Union address and rather focus on individual programs and ""lowering costs"" for Americans amid rising inflation.

A guest essay published by David Axelrod called on Biden to show a ""little humility"" during his speech and to tout his accomplishments but also acknowledge that Americans are ""still in the grips of a national trauma"" brought on by the pandemic.

""The state of the union is stressed,"" Axelrod wrote for The New York Times. ""To claim otherwise — to highlight the progress we have made, without fully acknowledging the hard road we have traveled and the distance we need to go — would seem off-key and out of touch. You simply cannot jawbone Americans into believing that things are better than they feel.""",https://www.foxnews.com
315,"Democratic governors 'expressing deep anxiety' over voters' frustrations with party, Biden: New York Times",Brandon Gillespie,"

Democratic governors and gubernatorial candidates are ""expressing deep anxiety"" over voters' frustrations with their party, as well as President Biden, driving fears of potential losses in elections this November.

According to a Monday piece by The New York Times, Democrats attending a weekend fund-raising retreat in Florida hoped their worries about voter backlash amid Biden's plummeting approval rating would be put to rest with his Tuesday State of the Union address.

THE BACKLASH OVER AN EXCESSIVELY WOKE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

""Democratic governors and their allies are expressing deep anxiety about the political conditions facing their party as President Biden’s approval rating slumps in a year when three dozen governorships are on the line, including in some of the nation’s most important battleground states,"" the piece read.

The Times noted that ""several governors, candidates for governor and donors"" acknowledged that voters were frustrated with the continuing pandemic and that it was ""damaging the party more than expected.""

Biden, whose approval rating reached a new low of 37% in recent polling, had promised on the 2020 campaign trail to ""shut down"" the virus. New variants, however, continued to spread, leading to record case numbers and deaths across the U.S.

The piece added that those concerned Democrats hoped that Biden's State of the Union address ""might serve as a pivot point"" for the party's election chances, considering it was coming amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden's nomination of Judge Ketanji Jackson as the likely first Black woman on the Supreme Court, and the easing of coronavirus guidance from the CDC.

PSAKI AVOIDS QUESTION ON POLLS DOUBTING BIDEN'S ‘MENTAL CAPACITY’ FOR OFFICE

The Times directly quoted a number of attendees at the retreat who openly expressed their fears for November.

""The environment is not where we want it to be right now … When you’re frustrated and angry, you blame the guy at the top,"" said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, while New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy argued that Democrats ""undersold historic investment"" in the U.S., appearing to reference the massive bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress late last year.

Murphy narrowly won his race for re-election in November by just over three percentage points in a state that voted for Biden by 16 points. On the same night, the now-Republican governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, won his race in a state that voted for Biden by 10 points.

Murphy went on to note that people were ""mad as hell,"" but strangely claimed they weren't ""necessarily sure why they’re mad or who they’re mad at,"" despite polls showing Biden and the Democrats underwater with voters on a number of issues, including their handling of the economy.

One Democratic donor who attended the event admitted to The Times that ""no one trusts the Democrat brand"" and that the party was facing headwinds.

There is a lot going on in the country, in the world. And when there's a lot going on, it's the perfect time to think and analyze and ask questions starting with ourselves. The answers, I think, will eventually come — or partial answers will eventually come — if we do spend enough time reflecting and analyzing and posing the right questions to those in positions of power and also to ourselves.

So, we'll start with what's been on my mind, which is that Russia invaded a sovereign neighboring country, and civilians are being killed. Russian and Ukrainian civilians are bearing the cost of wars waged by a Russian despot, which should lead us to wonder why there has been any equivocation by some in this country on the nature and intentions of Vladimir Putin.

Some in the media and in positions of power seem frankly enamored with Putin. Looking at the images of dead Ukrainian children should settle the question of who Putin is once and for all. It's not something I've wondered about, but it is apparently something that others have wondered about. And it does beg the question of what some people are drawn to.

326,Biden clams up when Nantucket business owner challenges him to name his favorite chowder,Emma Colton,"

As America feasted over Thanksgiving, President Biden visited New England for the holiday and was asked to choose a side on clam chowder: New England or Manhattan.

""Do you prefer Manhattan or New England Clam Chowder?"" Sean Dew, co-founder of Nantucket store TownPool, asked Biden on Saturday.

""I don’t like either,"" Biden responded.

BIDEN SPOTTED IN NANTUCKET SHOPPING INDOORS WITHOUT A MASK DESPITE SIGN MANDATING THEM

""Oh my God,"" Dew responds before saying: ""Alright, good answer.""

Biden does then say, ""No, no, no, New England clam chowder.""

New England and Manhattan have long tussled over who is king of clam chowder, with New England’s version boasting a creamy soup and Manhattan’s having one with a tomato base.

TownPool told Fox News on Sunday that Dew often asks people in the store what their favorite chowder is, describing it as a ""running joke."" The store's Instagram page shows celebrities and public figures such as James Carville, Amanda Knox, John Hope Bryant, John Kerry and others also answering the same question from Dew.

The store also posted the video of the lighthearted exchange on Instagram, accompanied by various products it sells with Biden's name.

""We have received a lot of hate for posting the video and the product that we are selling,"" TownPool told Fox News in an email. ""Ironically a majority of our staff did NOT vote for the President, but were honored he visited.""

The store added that it previously faced ""double irony"" when it was ""beat up by the left for selling our NanTexas shirts.""

TownPool also touted that Biden is ""the first sitting President to spend the night on Nantucket since President Grant in 1874.""

Several lawmakers expressed concern that the Biden administration did not respond quickly to provide Ukraine with significant military aid, such as anti-aircraft and rocket launcher systems that would defend against an invasion from Russia.

328,Senators in both parties urge Biden admin to grant deportation protections for Ukrainian nationals in US,Adam Shaw,"

Republican and Democratic senators urged the Biden administration this week to grant protections from deportation to Ukrainians already in the country in response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

More than 40 senators, led by Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., wrote to President Biden calling for Ukrainian nationals already in the country to be given Temporary Protected Status (TPS.)

BIDEN ADMIN FACING CALLS TO GIVE UKRAINIANS IN US PROTECTIONS FROM DEPORTATION

TPS protects nationals of designated countries living in the U.S. from potential deportation if they are eligible, allows them to apply for work permits and gives them the freedom to travel.

TPS status is granted based on three grounds: armed ongoing conflict, environmental disasters or ""extraordinary and temporary conditions."" The lawmakers argue that Ukraine ""clearly meets the standard"" for TPS given the invasion from Moscow.

""Granting TPS to the limited population of Ukrainians who are currently in the U.S. on a temporary basis will create a minimal disruption for our country, but forcing these individuals to return to a war zone would be unacceptable,"" the senators wrote.

""Forcing Ukrainian nationals to return to Ukraine in the midst of a war would be inconsistent with America’s values and our national security interests,"" they said. ""As a nation, we must do our part to protect the safety of Ukrainians in the United States by designating Ukraine for TPS.""

The letter cites State Department figures that there were 29,510 nonimmigrant (temporary) visas issued to Ukrainians in FY 2020.

It is the latest call for the administration to use TPS for Ukrainian nationals. Some activists have also suggested that Biden could issue a similar Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) designation for Ukrainian nationals, which is issued at the president's discretion.

More than 170 groups have already written to President Biden , DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging them to designate Ukraine for TPS and DED and also grant students relief (SSR) — citing estimates that it would protect approximately 30,000 Ukrainians.

""Given the already unmet humanitarian need in the country and the effects of armed conflict with Russia, Ukraine is in no state to receive TPS/DED and SSR eligible Ukrainians,"" the groups argued in a letter last week. ""Returning these Ukrainians to an at-war country would further destabilize the precarious conditions.""

The TPS program has been criticized before by immigration hawks, who argue the designation often protects those here illegally and is extended well beyond the immediate time period of an initial emergency or crisis. Some hawks have argued that TPS is unnecessary and that the administration could just extend periods of stay instead.

""I'm all for that. Ban it,"" Pelosi said Thursday at a press conference at the Capitol.

332,"Jailhouse Letter: Guccifer laments failure to expose 'crimes,' rails against Clinton",Catherine Herridge,"

EXCLUSIVE: The Romanian hacker who first exposed the clintonemail.com address and faces the imminent return to his home country told Fox News – in a letter from his jail cell in Virginia – that he breached the accounts of public figures in an effort to expose corruption but now considers that effort a failure.

“I will not leave this beautiful country without saying that the ‘Guccifer Project’ was a failed project,” wrote Marcel Lehel Lazar, also known as Guccifer.

In neat handwriting and colorful language, the hacker used the correspondence to rail against Hillary Clinton and other figures while lamenting his own cyber-limitations and circumstances.

“My departure is a matter of days,” said the 44-year-old Lazar, who is expected to be flown at any moment back to his native country Romania to finish out a seven-year prison sentence. Prior to his extradition to the U.S. in March, Lazar had served three years of that sentence in a prison near Arad, Romania.

Justice Department officials, in announcing the hacker’s guilty plea this past May, described Lazar as a cybercriminal who “sought fame” by hacking Americans’ accounts.

Lazar, in committing his crimes, nevertheless demonstrated an astute ability in guessing passwords and command of using Russian proxy servers to harass and embarrass his victims. Those victims included high-level Romanian politicians, celebrities and at least 100 Americans including Colin Powell, Dorothy Bush Koch and longtime Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Blumenthal breach first exposed the “clintonemail” account in March 2013.

Lazar was a voracious reader of biographies of public figures and claimed those he hacked had passwords that were easy to figure out.

After his hacking escapades for which he pleaded guilty to two U.S. federal counts, Lazar told Fox News in hours of recorded phone interviews and an in-person jailhouse meeting how he breached accounts belonging to Blumenthal and Powell.

His letter is imbued with references to conspiracy theories like the “Illuminati,” which he believes is an international cabal that controls world affairs and wants to expose.

And he takes rhetorical aim at Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee: “Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, (sic) satanic, shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt motive to understand what I am talking about.”

As leaks continue to swirl around Clinton’s email practices while she served as secretary of state, Guccifer apologized to his fellow hackers in the letter to Fox News for his shortcomings.

“Though I know I invested a great deal of time and effort trying to expose the crimes of the Rockefellers, the Bush Klan (sic) the Clinton, and many others, maybe my skills were NOT matching my faith,” he wrote.

“So I apologize in front of the unknown soldiers who struggle to take this fight against these monsters to a glorious end. Many of ‘em are risking their lives, while doing this behind the computer screens, from inside or outside the system.”

In May, Guccifer repeatedly claimed to Fox News during a series of interviews that he had successfully breached Clinton’s private server. Guccifer made the same claims to NBC News, which published his claims later.

In July, when FBI Director James Comey was asked about this claim before Congress, he testified, ""He did not [gain access to Clinton's server], he admitted that was a lie.”

However, Comey added: “We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account.”

The FBI file sent to Congress showed the server was targeted immediately after “IP addresses from Russia and Ukraine attempted to scan the server on March 15, 2013, the day after the Blumenthal compromise, and on March 19 and March 21, 2013.”

It is worth noting that in a portion of the highly redacted and recently released FBI report on Clinton’s email practices, page 32 noted Lazar’s use of screenshots in disseminating information. “One of the screenshots captured list of 19 foreign policy and intelligence memos authored by Blumenthal for Clinton,” it said.

Lazar was finally arrested in Romania in 2013. Among his Romanian victims is the former Minister of Information George Maior, who now serves as the current Romanian ambassador to the U.S.

The Romanian Embassy had no comment to Fox News about Lazar and said their media and press representative “was on leave.”

During Lazar’s Sept. 1 sentencing, U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris noted that Romanian prison conditions are much “worse” than in the U.S. Cacheris sentenced Lazar to a 52-month sentence in the U.S. but it is unclear when and how that will be fulfilled -- because in a move that appeared to surprise Lazar’s defense counsel Shannon Quill, it was announced that Romania wanted Guccifer sent back to finish his sentence “right away.”

Sounding somewhat concerned in the Sept. 15-dated letter, Lazar thanked Fox News for being present in the courtroom and weighed in on his country’s demand for his return: “The Romanian authorities query that I have to be sent home 'right away,' is a silly hasty move, by the way.”

The senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, slammed Dr. Anthony Fauci's NIH for funding allegedly tens of thousands of dollars into proposed medical research on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Tuesday.

""PETA's discovered the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases spent more than 200 grand on a proposed experiment that would ‘subject real male rhesus monkeys to feminizing hormone therapy to see whether that makes them more susceptible to HIV to help transgender women,'"" host Tucker Carlson said. ""It couldn't get uglier.""

""Did you make this up?"" Carlson asked Kathy Guillermo.

""It sounds like it, doesn't it? I mean, it's an experiment that an eighth-grade science student could figure out is totally meaningless,"" she said. ""But no, unfortunately, we did not.""

PETA CALLS FOR DR. FAUCI TO RESIGN: ‘OUR POSITION IS CLEAR’

""They take male monkeys [and] … put them in metal boxes — that's where they're forced to live. They subject them to so-called hormone treatment. And from that, they're supposed to learn something about HIV transmission … This is a study that could be done with human volunteers, and we might actually find something out that would help human beings.""

Carlson asked if it was a fair assessment that the NIH is ""inflicting massive cruelty on animals who are helpless"" and that ""they seem driven by research dollars.""

""That's just absolutely correct,"" Kathy Guillermo said. ""We wrote to Fauci last month, and we pointed out that HIV experiments on monkeys have killed tens of thousands of monkeys. They've cost us billions of dollars, and we have no vaccine to prevent HIV. Now, you would think that four decades of utter failure would inspire NIH to try something different, but they haven't so far.""

""I think it says you're not a very good human being,"" she said, referring to the nature of research.

335,NATO rules out Ukraine no-fly zone: 'Painful decision',Paul Conner,"

NATO nations will not impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, despite pleas from some in Ukraine.

Secretary Jens Stoltenberg called it a ""painful decision,"" saying that NATO has a responsibility not to escalate the conflict by engaging Russian forces directly in Ukraine, either on the ground or in the air.

Enforcing a no-fly zone would involve NATO planes in Ukraine potentially shooting down Russian planes, Stoltenberg said Friday. President Biden's administration has likewise ruled out such a move, saying it is ""not going to happen.""

""We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering,"" he said.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday that ""all options are on the table"" during a discussion about oil prices after MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle asked if President Biden would consider ""working something out with Iran.""

Ruhle asked Buttigieg if Biden would consider activating the Keystone XL Pipeline or ""working something out with Iran"" during MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour"" on Wednesday.

""Look, the president has said that all options are on the table. But we also need to make sure we're not galloping after permanent solutions to immediate short term problems where more strategic and tactical actions in the short term could make a difference,"" he responded.

Political commentators, personalities and politicians criticized Buttigieg on Twitter for the comments. Critics called for American energy independence as the Russians continue to invade Ukraine.

PELOSI FAVORS BANNING ALL RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES

""Using North American oil to decouple economic dependency on the resources of hostile nations is a long term solution,"" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said in response to the clip. He was one of several lawmakers to weigh in.

Others criticized a different part of Buttigieg's statement, saying that, ""we should be seeking permanent solutions.""

Democrats and Republicans have called for Biden to ban oil imports from Russia. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-CA., said Thursday that she was ""all for"" banning Russian oil. Rep. Lisa Murkowski, R-AK., and Rep. Joe Manchin, D-WV., introduced bipartisan legislation Thursday that would ban the importing of Russian oil.

REPUBLICANS DEMAND BIDEN STOP FUNDING PUTIN'S WAR WITH OIL PURCHASES

Murkowski told Politico that banning Russian oil was the most significant tool the U.S. has left to throw at Russia. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked about what it would take to ban imports from Russia during Thursday's White House press briefing.

""What would need to happen in order to prompt a final decision on an oil ban?"" NBC's Kristen Welker asked.

""I don't know if we look at it exactly through that prism ... We have not held back in taking significant, historic steps that are crippling the Russian economy right now,"" Psaki responded.

""We don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy and that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people,"" she added.

CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked if the administration has moved any closer to banning oil coming from Russia and Psaki said that she doesn't have an assessment on it. Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich also pressed Psaki on Russian oil imports.

""During those years where it would take to bring down prices as you're saying, we should just continue to buy Russian oil?"" Heinrich asked.

""Well, Jacqui, I think you're familiar with a number of steps we've taken. A historic release from the strategic petroleum reserve,"" Psaki said. ""What this is all a reminder of in the president's view is our need to reduce our reliance on oil. Europeans need to do that, we need to do that. If we do more to invest in clean energy, more to invest in other sources of energy, that's exactly what we need to do to prevent this from happening in the future.""

339,Mike Pompeo: US should immediately recognize Taiwan as ‘free and sovereign country’,Dom Calicchio,"

The U.S. should immediately ""do the right and obvious thing"" and recognize Taiwan as a ""free and sovereign country,"" former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote Thursday night in a series of Twitter messages.

Pompeo’s comments came as he visited Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei – and as war continued to rage in Ukraine late Thursday into Friday, with a fire at a nuclear power plant bringing a potentially frightening new scenario into play, although the fire was later reported to be extinguished.

A possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan has loomed as a possibility in the wake of Russia’s Ukraine invasion, with some foreign-affairs experts arguing U.S. adversaries may be eager to test how willing and able the Biden administration is to respond to acts of aggression.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

But Pompeo warned that Taiwan must not suffer an attack similar to that in Ukraine.

Risk to freedom

""If any of us were mistaken or complacent about the risk to that freedom, I think we need only watch what’s taking place in Europe today to see that this continues to demand deep, concerted, focus[ed] leadership from those of us who cherish freedom,"" Pompeo said, according to the Taipei Times.

The world is already watching for whether economic sanctions imposed by the Biden administration and other Western leaders will be enough to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war, now in its ninth day.

In the immediate term, clear support for Taiwan is an important message for the U.S. to send, Pompeo wrote Thursday.

""It is my view that the U.S. government should immediately take necessary, and long-overdue, steps to do the right and obvious thing, that is to offer the Republic of China (Taiwan) America’s diplomatic recognition as a free and sovereign country,"" wrote Pompeo, 58, a former CIA director and Kansas congressman who is reportedly eyeing the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nomination.

""This isn’t about Taiwan’s future independence, it’s about recognizing an unmistakable already existent reality,"" Pompeo continued. ""That reality is, as many of your past & present leaders have made clear, there’s no need for Taiwan to declare independence because it’s already an independent country.

""Its name is the Republic of China (Taiwan). The people and government of the United States should simply recognize this political, diplomatic and sovereignty reality. The Taiwanese people deserve the world’s respect for a free, democratic and sovereign country.""

Deliberate word choice?

In an earlier message that was not part of the thread, Pompeo declared: ""It is not provocative to demand freedom."" The comment accompanied photos of Pompeo and wife Susan Pompeo with Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.

Pompeo’s choice of the word ""provocative"" may have been deliberate. It was the same word that Chinese officials used earlier in the week after a U.S. Navy destroyer passed through the Taiwan Strait last weekend -- the second such move by a U.S. military vessel this year.

The destroyer’s journey came just days after China sent nine of its military aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting Taiwan to scramble its air force, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense said.

Pompeo also posted a video in which he praised Taiwan’s leaders as ""great, freedom-loving people who understand that the United States and Taiwan have a great relationship [and] it’s important that we keep it.""

China-Russia cabal?

Earlier this week came reports that China was believed to have asked Russia to delay the Ukraine invasion until after the Winter Olympics in Beijing, raising the possibility of broader efforts by China and Russia to confer on their separate military plans.

On Wednesday night, Pompeo appeared on Fox News’ ""The Ingraham Angle,"" where he spoke about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He expressed concern that the U.S. military under the Biden administration might become distracted by ""woke"" concerns such as its use of green energy, rather than its primary mission of keeping America safe.

""I am very worried about ensuring that our military is focused on the things that need to be focused on,"" Pompeo told host Laura Ingraham.

He also claimed the U.S. should have prevented the Ukraine invasion ""months ago.""

FIRST ON FOX: Border Patrol agents patrolling the Rio Grande Valley Sector were fired upon from across the Mexican border on Wednesday, multiple law enforcement sources told Fox News.

The Special Operations Group, part of Border Patrol Tactical Operations (BORTAC), were shot at from beyond the border, and then returned fire – nobody on either side was hit.

TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS FIRED UPON ACROSS BORDER BY SUSPECTED CARTEL GUNMEN, AUTHORITIES SAY

In a statement to Fox News, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed that agents responded to a report of suspected migrants near Fronton. The statement also confirmed that the incident is being reviewed by both the FBI and CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility.

Fox is told that the Mexican military had engaged with cartel members in a shootout on the Mexican side, at which point a man fled and tried to cross into the U.S. via a nearby river. When a BORTAC agent jumped into the water to rescue him, the agent was fired upon.

It occurred in the same area where Texas National Guard members were shot at from Mexico just last month. The suspected shooters were believed to be gunmen from a drug cartel, but it was not clear. No National Guard members were hurt.

It is also where Fox News personally witnessed tracer fire from a cartel machine gun coming into U.S. territory.

That area in Roma is viewed as cartel land and is where the Gulf cartel and Cartel Del Noreste fight for control of the city in Mexico across from Roma – Ciudad Miguel Aleman.

Heavily armed groups are becoming a more common sight along the Texas-Mexico border, authorities said. Last month, Texas Department of Public Safety officials told Fox News that suspected cartel members involved in human smuggling were wearing tactical gear and armed with AK-47s while taunting National Guard soldiers across the Rio Grande.

Mexican cartels have been known to commit acts of violence on migrants traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border, but it is rare for them to confront American law enforcement or military troops.

343,White House says COVID-19 money on 'empty' as it ties approval to Ukraine aid,Julia Musto,"

The White House is warning that the U.S. will soon begin to run out of money for COVID-19 supplies unless Congress acts to approve more funding.

Officials say more money is needed for antibody treatments, preventative pills and to fund testing sites.

BIDEN ADMIN SENDS MIXED MESSAGES ON ALLEGED RUSSIAN WAR CRIMES

""From the COVID side, the bank account is empty,"" COVID-19 deputy coordinator Natalie Quillian said. ""We’re in conversations with lawmakers about how to secure the funding, but it’s urgently needed."" Some of the consequences could be felt later this month.

""This is an urgent request and this is what is at stake in our fight against COVID,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday.

A request sent to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) seeks $22.5 billion in immediate COVID-19 response needs with an ask for $10 billion to provide support to Ukraine following Russia's invasion.

""I urge the Congress to address these critical and urgent needs as part of a comprehensive government funding bill ahead of the March 11th funding deadline,"" OMB acting Director Shalanda Young said in the Wednesday letter, noting that ""additional needs may arise over time"" due to the ""rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine.""

The Biden administration has warned that COVID-19 testing manufacturers will start to slow production of at-home rapid tests this month – unless the federal government signs contracts to purchase more.

The Health Resources and Services Administration will be forced to begin winding down claims for COVID-19 treatment for uninsured people this month in Congress doesn't provide more money. The U.S. government supply of monoclonal antibodies would run out in May.

""These resources are needed promptly to immediately secure supply of highly effective oral antiviral treatments; to purchase monoclonal antibodies and pre-exposure prophylaxis; to continue operating critical testing initiatives and funding testing, treatments and vaccines for the uninsured; to initiate work on a next-generation vaccine that protects against future variants; to accelerate global vaccination efforts and provide urgent humanitarian relief abroad; and for other purposes,"" Young said.

Should regulators make the Pfizer vaccine for children under age 5 a three-dose regimen, or if they determine kids aged 5-11 should get boosted, the administration would need more money.

CONGRESS CAN TALK A LOT ABOUT UKRAINE, BUT ITS POWER TO ACT IS LIMITED

However, lawmakers have struggled to reach a spending agreement for the current fiscal year and Republicans have expressed concerns over how much money would be spent towards pandemic relief.

""Oh no, that’s too much,"" Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said Thursday when asked about the administration’s $22.5 billion request. ""And secondly, we want to see how much money is out there"" that hasn’t been spent yet from previously approved COVID-19 funding.

Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and 35 other GOP senators wrote to President Biden on Tuesday saying they want a ""full accounting"" of how the government has spent funds already provided before supporting new money.

The president signed the sweeping $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law last March without any support from Republicans.

Now, the White House says it is open to exploring reallocating already-approved, unspent money – and potentially shifting the cost of shots and pills to insurers. But, it emphasized that the priority must be to continue to meet needs.

""We are being reasonable in our urgent request now, but we know more will be needed,"" said Quillian.

Since the pandemic's start. COVID-19 relief bills have contained $370 billion for public health programs, according to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) table obtained by The Associated Press, $355 billion of which is currently being spent, has been spent or has been committed to contracts.

345,Tucker Carlson: A sincere message to Washington and our cable news colleagues - Please calm down,Tucker Carlson,"

What's the point at which rhetoric forces action? When do words become incitement? At what point do political attacks become so reckless and unhinged that you can no longer heal the divide they create with politics and force people towards something darker?

Well, it's hard to know exactly when that point is, but the left is getting very close to it. We could give you many examples of this. We will begin with this exchange from last Tuesday night on MSNBC. This is frequent guest, Malcolm Nance, accusing the president of the United States of sending secret messages to neo-Nazis:

Malcolm Nance, MSNBC commentator: ""These people feel that they are the foot soldiers executors of what the disenfranchisement that the white race is feeling and Donald Trump is giving them subliminal orders in their head.""

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.

Subliminal orders. Whatever his faults, you can be certain that Donald Trump is not doing that. Trump is the least subliminal politician in American history. He has no subtext. That's part of the problem, of course. If he is thinking it, he is saying it.

The claim is ludicrous. But at MSNBC, it wasn't even the weirdest thing uttered on their air on Tuesday. That distinction goes to Frank Figliuzzi. He is a former FBI official-turned-talking head-conspiracy nut. He used numerology to explain the president's ""coded messages."" Watch this, and keep in mind, it is entirely real. We've not edited a single word.

Frank Figliuzzi, former FBI official: It's the little things and language and messaging that matters. The president said that we will fly our flags at half-mast until August 8th -- that's 8-8. Now I'm not going to imply that he did this deliberately, but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that's being demonstrated by the White House. The numbers 8-8 are very significant in neo-Nazi and white supremacy movement. Why? Because the letter H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and to them, the numbers 8 together stand for ""Heil, Hitler.""

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

Got that? Eight is a racist number. That's what they're telling you on MSNBC. In other words, things are getting dangerously crazy on the left. How crazy? Well, on Monday, former Jeb Bush spokeswoman, Nicolle Wallace explained that President Trump is planning a genocide of Hispanic-Americans. Watch this.

Raul Reyes, NBC news contributor: ""He ramped it up again to the invasion, the warning people of the caravan and words like ""infestation."" What do you do with an infestation? With an infestation? The natural conclusion is to attempt extermination.""

Nicolle Wallace, MSNBC anchor: ""President Obama used the power of the presidency to try to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the Latino community, Latino leaders at the table. You now have a president, as you said, talking about exterminating Latinos.""

""Exterminating Latinos."" Keep in mind that Donald Trump, as a factual matter, got a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney did.

It turns out that not all Latinos believe in open borders; a lot of them don't. Some of them agree with Donald Trump on immigration. And yet the left is now telling you -- and demanding that you believe -- that anyone who supports Donald Trump is a white supremacist and must be destroyed. Now they're telling you that for political reasons -- this is election season, obviously, and they want more political power.

But there are other reasons, too, that they're saying this. Ever wonder why rich people seem the most hysterical on the subject? Ever notice that it's the highest-paid people on television who are the most determined to convince you that white supremacy is America's biggest problem? Why is that?

Simple. Every minute you're angry about race is a minute you're not thinking about class, which, of course, is the real divide in this country. Working-class people of all colors have a lot more in common -- infinitely more in common -- with each other than they do with some overpaid MSNBC anchor. And if you were allowed to think about that for long enough, you might start to get unauthorized ideas about economics, and that would be disruptive to a very lucrative status quo.

So they whip you into a frenzy of racial fear so that it never enters your mind. It's a diversion. Everyone else hates each other, they get to keep their money. Pretty tricky. Unfortunately, it's also destroying the country. This is the path to civil war, obviously.

This country is not on the brink of genocide. It's not even close to that. This is not a white supremacist country plotting the slaughter of its own people. It's a kind country, full of decent people of all races, who, like all people everywhere, make bad decisions from time to time. But they mean well, and they generally try their best.

So we want to take a second to pass on a sincere message to official Washington and particularly to our colleagues on the other cable news channels, and it's this: Please, for the sake of the nation, calm down.

Yes, America has problems. Yes, racism is one of America's problems. But so is a fading middle class. So is a terrifying drug epidemic that's killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. So is the national debt that is growing by a trillion dollars a year.

These are huge problems, and people know that. People know their country is in decline, and it's making them turn to new political leaders. Donald Trump was one of those new leaders. Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are a couple of others. This is a time of frustration, and it's a time of change. It's a hard time for America.

But this country is not on the brink of genocide. It's not even close to that. This is not a white supremacist country plotting the slaughter of its own people. It's a kind country, full of decent people of all races, who, like all people everywhere, make bad decisions from time to time. But they mean well, and they generally try their best.

So going forward, give them the benefit of the doubt, even when you disagree with them -- maybe, especially when you disagree with them. These are your fellow Americans. Cut them a break. They deserve it. And remember, the alternative is disaster.

As Ukrainians flee their country from Russia’s military onslaught, they face the prospect of the invisible enemy – bacteria and viruses that capitalize on the overcrowded conditions brought on by the bloody invasion, according to the Washington Post.

""As we’ve seen in wars over the years, viruses and bacteria are happy to exploit those situations where human beings are put under pressure,"" said Máire Connolly, professor at the National University of Ireland Galway who studies the relationship between war and disease.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS COVID-19 MONEY ON ‘EMPTY’ AS IT TIES APPROVAL TO UKRAINE AID

""These factors increase the risk of outbreaks among a population that are already dealing with the trauma of forced displacement.""

As the Russian offensive cuts off travel, Ukraine’s hospitals are running out of vital medical supplies. Healthcare workers relocate their patients to makeshift shelters as civilian casualties mount under the threat of an explosion at any moment’s notice, per the news outlet.

""What we’re dealing with now in Ukraine is a double crisis,"" Connolly added, also noting the war conditions are fodder not only for COVID-19, but also the ongoing Ukraine polio outbreak, which international experts have been trying to end for months.

She describes the often the paradoxical plight of refugees as they flee to safety only to end up in unsanitary and often unsafe conditions that are the perfect environments for an infectious disease outbreak, such as the reemergence of tuberculosis, the paper added.

Ukraine suffered some of the world’s worst rates of COVID-19 as neighboring European countries enjoyed some of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe, creating the threat of a COVID-19 surge as thousands, potentially millions, of Ukrainians seek refuge into neighboring countries, per the Post.

""I am heartbroken and gravely concerned for the health of the people in Ukraine in the escalating crisis,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said in a recent statement.

He posted a video on Twitter of newborns in Ukraine in a makeshift bomb shelter that he called ""beyond heartbreaking.""

This past Sunday he warned the country is almost running on empty with oxygen supplies as US officials accuse the Russian military of firing on ambulances and hospitals.

""The majority of hospitals could exhaust their oxygen reserves within the next 24 hours. Some have already run out,"" the WHO added.

Compounding the situation, experts warn the conflict may have also disturbed sensitive radioactive waste stored at the Chernobyl nuclear plant that could ignite another environmental disaster, according to the Post.

The paper added, however, international humanitarian organizations are rallying to provide emergency support, with the WHO providing $3.5 million in additional emergency funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development deploying a disaster response team to Poland, and together with the State Department, is providing nearly $54 million in additional assistance.

A Russian military commander and prisoner of war in Ukraine said he and his forces were led to believe they were invading the country because ""nationalists, Nazis have seized power,"" according to a video that surfaced Monday.

Russian Lt. Col. Astakhov Dmitry Mikhailovich was flanked by two badly bruised men as he said they were told in Russia ""that Ukraine's territory is dominated by fascist's regime,"" according to video shared by Ukraine’s News Channel 24, via a translation from the New York Post.

352,Republicans troubled by ongoing talks to revive Iran nuclear deal: 'Russia should not be at any table',Marisa Schultz,"

Republicans are raising alarms about a possible breakthrough to restart the Iran nuclear deal, amid reports that the U.S. and Iran are coming close to restoring the 2015 nuclear agreement.

Negotiations have been ongoing in Vienna for the United States to rejoin the international deal that President Trump pulled out of in 2018. Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China are still part of the deal with Iran and have been trying to salvage it.

Republicans have long been skeptical of the Iran nuclear deal, but say the timing for any restart is particularly troubling given Russia's involvement during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES

""Russia should not be at any table with us right now,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., told Fox News Digital, adding that he's ""very concerned"" about a new deal. ""They're committing egregious acts of terrorism and murder in a free democracy in Ukraine, in Europe right now.""

REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK HEADS TO UKRAINE BORDER: 'I WILL GO AS FAR AS THEY WILL ALLOW ME TO GO'

Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., also spoke out against any restart of a deal, calling it ""exceedingly dangerous and exceedingly misguided"" on the ""The Guy Benson Show"" on Fox News Radio.

And Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, warned on Twitter that a nuclear deal with Iran could make it ""EASIER for the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism to obtain a nuclear weapon.""

The ramped-up concern is following reporting from the Wall Street Journal on March 3 that the U.S. and Iran were closing in on an agreement after weeks of intense negotiations in Vienna involving the U.S. and Iran, and Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. Officials from both the U.S. and Iran warned that they were still resolving sanctions relief provisions.

A European diplomat told Fox News on Friday that a new deal is expected within days.

Congressional Republicans say they haven't been consulted about any deal the Biden administration is negotiating with the help of the Russians. They are pushing for any new agreement to be reviewed by Congress.

CRUZ, SENATE REPUBLICANS THREATEN TO BLOCK ANY IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT NOT SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS

The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act passed in 2015 with bipartisan support requires the administration to submit any deal to Congress for review within five days of it being reached.

A group of 33 Republican senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, already pledged last month to do everything in their power to block a new nuclear deal if President Biden doesn't get Senate approval.

In addition to Russia's involvement in the Iran nuclear deal, Fitzpatrick said that the Iranian government ""does not operate in good faith"" and the U.S. doesn't even enforce existing agreements.

Fitzpatrick, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was referring to the 1994 agreement where Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union in exchange for commitments from Russia and the West to respect Ukraine's sovereignty.

""Does anybody think that if Ukraine were the third-largest holder of nuclear weapons that Russia would be invading them right now?"" Fitzpatrick said. ""Of course not. They gave them up based on our word, based on the commitment that the United States, the UK gave to Ukraine and to Kazakhstan as well.

""And we're not upholding our end of the agreement,"" Fitzpatrick continued. ""So what does that mean for future nuclear anti-proliferation agreements? They're proceeding down the wrong path on all these fronts.""

However, the Iran regime itself is an ally of Russia and has sought to disperse blame for the invasion.

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in a recent speech blamed the crisis on the United States.

""Today, Ukraine is a victim of the U.S. crisis-making policy because it was the United States that brought Ukraine to this point by interfering in Ukraine's internal affairs, organizing rallies and creating a velvet and colorful coup, the presence of American senators in opposition rallies, and the replacement of governments has brought this country to this point,"" Khamenei said, according to the Iranian government.

The dictator also described the U.S. as a ""mafia regime"" in his speech.

Independent and foreign journalists based in Russia are fleeing the country as Russian President Vladimir Putin cracks down on dissenting information about his invasion of Ukraine.

Alexey Kovalyav, an editor at an independent news outlet in Russia and a fellow at the World Press Institute, said he left the country in a Friday tweet.

""Never thought it'd come to this, but I did have to leave Russia, crossing the border on foot in the middle of the night, with my panic-packed bags on my back and my dog in tow,"" he wrote. ""Felt a massive door slam shut behind my back. Barely had enough time to call my parents. Crazy times.""

Putin signed a new bill on Friday imposing prison sentences of up to 15 years for those spreading information that goes against the Russian government’s narrative on the war.

Russian authorities have repeatedly and falsely decried reports of Russian military setbacks or civilian deaths in Ukraine as ""fake"" news. State media outlets refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war or an invasion.

355,Rolling Stone forced to issue an 'update' after viral hospital ivermectin story turns out to be false,Lindsay Kornick,"

Rolling Stone was forced to issue an update to its viral story about Oklahoma hospitals being overwhelmed by patients who overdosed on the drug ivermectin after the doctor it cited was contradicted by the hospitals he referenced.

On Friday, the liberal magazine published testimony from Dr. Jason McElyea, who told a local news station that hospitals were being overrun from patients overdosing on ivermectin which resulted in other patients waiting for treatment. McElyea claimed the situation was so bad that gunshot victims were being neglected.

""The ERs are so backed up that gunshot victims were having hard times getting to facilities where they can get definitive care and be treated,"" McElyea said.

The story, which originally appeared in Oklahoma's KFOR-TV news, was widely shared by reporters, including MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow.

Fellow MSNBC left-wing anchor Joy Reid also promoted the story during her show on Friday, repeating McElyea's claims.

""An emergency in one rural Oklahoma town is being overwhelmed by people overdosing on ivermectin, the horse deworming medication. It's gotten so bad that gunshot victims, gunshot victims are having to wait to be treated,"" she said.

The story was also shared by New York Daily News, Newsweek, The Guardian and Insider.

However, the Northeastern Hospital System, which McElyea works for, issued a statement regarding his association with the hospitals reported in the story. The NHS revealed while McElyea ""is affiliated"" with a medial staffing group, he has not worked at the location in question for 2 months nor has he treated any ivermectin overdoses.

""Although Dr. Jason McElyea is not an employee of NHS Sequoyah, he is affiliated with a medical staffing group that provides coverage for our emergency room. With that said, Dr. McElyea has not worked at our Sallisaw location in over 2 months. NHS Sequoyah has not treated any patients due to complications related to taking ivermectin. This includes not treating any patients for ivermectin overdose,"" the statement reads.

Furthermore, the NHS insisted that patients are not being turned any for emergency care in contrast to the recent reports.

""All patients who have visited our emergency room have received medical attention as appropriate,"" NHS said. ""Our hospital has not had to turn away any patients seeking emergency care. We want to reassure our community that our staff is working hard to provide quality healthcare to all patients. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify this issue and as always, we value our community’s support.""

Rolling Stone later published an ""update"" to the top of the story which repeats NHS' statement.

Critics slammed the magazine for publishing what appears to be a false story.

Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted, ""The only reason Rolling Stone is calling this an ‘UPDATE’ as opposed to what it so plainly is -- a RETRACTION -- is because liberal outlets know that their readers don't care at all if they publish fake news as long as it's done with the right political motives and goals.""

356,"How Democratic presidents Clinton, Obama and Biden caused the crisis in Ukraine",Justin Haskins,"

Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. presidents of both major political parties have had their fair share of setbacks, failures, and outright disasters in foreign policy. But few, if any, have been quite as stark as Democrats' mishandling of the situation in Ukraine.

After decades of abuse at the hands of brutal Soviet regimes, Ukraine now stands on the brink of war with Russia, and for the time being, it seems no one is coming to its rescue.

RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Although the relationship and history between Russia and Ukraine are complex, the failure of Democratic presidents' leadership, as well as their contributions to the current crisis, couldn’t be clearer.

Clinton's Nuclear-Sized Mistake



First, there’s President Bill Clinton’s disastrous decision to support the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, a choice supported by numerous congressional Democrats then and since.



At the time of the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world. Ukraine controlled some 5,000 nuclear weapons, including, as the New York Times noted in a report earlier this month, ""long-range missiles that carried up to 10 thermonuclear warheads, each far stronger than the bomb that leveled Hiroshima.""

In 1992, Ukraine signed the Lisbon Protocol, agreeing to return the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the Soviet government back to Russia. But members of the Ukrainian parliament soon thereafter increasingly voiced serious concerns over total nuclear disarmament, in large part due to fears of a future conflict with Russia.

Throughout 1992 and 1993, Russia and the Clinton White House worked furiously to convince Ukraine to give up all of its nuclear weapons. After substantial political pressure, Ukraine caved in 1994, but only after the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom agreed to protect Ukraine in the event of a future attack on the nation’s sovereignty, as well as financial support and a number of other assurances.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS: NIKKI HALEY SAYS BIDEN 'FAILING' IN 'MAJOR LEADERSHIP MOMENT'

Ukraine dismantled and relinquished its nuclear weapons, giving President Clinton and the Russians a diplomatic victory. The decision has haunted Ukraine ever since.

Had Ukraine maintained at least part of its nuclear arsenal, it is highly unlikely Russia would be considering an invasion today.



Broken Promises

The most critical part of Ukraine’s 1994 agreement to disarm was the pledge by the United States, Russia, and United Kingdom to protect Ukraine against unwarranted aggression. The initial agreement, the so-called Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, was later reaffirmed in 2009 by President Barack Obama.

However, in 2014, Obama watched as Russian-backed rebels, with support from Russian troops, seized control of Crimea, a region belonging to Ukraine. The rebel-backed government then seceded from Ukraine and annexed it to Vladimir Putin’s government in Russia.

BIDEN'S FOREIGN POLICY DILEMMA IN UKRAINE PROMPTS MEDIA SCRUTINY REMINISCENT OF AFGHANISTAN

The Obama administration, working alongside officials from the European Union, responded by issuing sanctions and freezing Russian assets. They also imposed travel restrictions. Obama did not, though, keep the promise the United States made in 1994 and 2009 to protect the sovereignty of Ukraine.

Of course, Putin didn’t flinch, and Crimea has been a part of Russia ever since.

The Big ‘Green’ Power Vacuum

President Obama and his then-vice president, Joe Biden, were fierce opponents of the fossil-fuel industry for both of Obama’s terms. They opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, forced states to adopt ""renewable"" energy like wind and solar, issued countless regulations that killed hundreds of coal-fired power plants, and restricted drilling and exploration of natural gas on public lands—policies the United States has once again adopted under President Biden.

In addition to having a negative impact on U.S. economic growth, these policies caused numerous nations to turn to Russia for low-cost energy.

Instead of importing fossil fuels from American companies, the European Union has become dependent on Russia, which is now the number-one source of natural gas in Europe, supplying about 41% of the region’s supply. Russia is also the largest supplier of crude oil and coal.

Due to the Biden administration’s failure in leadership, the United States has never looked weaker.

Because much of Europe now depends on Russian energy, it can’t afford to stand up to Russia’s hostilities in Ukraine — or anywhere else, for that matter.

The Trump administration attempted to convince European nations to depend on the United States’ vast natural gas production instead, but such appeals largely failed because European leaders knew Donald Trump wouldn’t be president forever, and that a Democratic administration would swiftly attempt to scale back fossil-fuel development.

Or, in the words of one energy expert wrote for the National Interest in 2019, ""Why bet the proverbial farm on a U.S. [liquified natural gas] supply across the Atlantic if there remains significant doubt as to whether a Democratic successor to Trump – particularly as 2020 candidates endorse the so-called ‘Green New Deal’ with varying degrees of enthusiasm — would continue with such plans?""

Afghanistan

Of course, no list of Democratic presidents’ policy failures would be complete without mentioning Biden’s disastrous withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 2021.

As a recent report from Republicans on the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs accurately summarized, ""The Biden Administration squandered precious time, ignored intelligence and recommendations from people on the ground, and refused bipartisan support to give them the resources to succeed. In the process, the botched withdrawal has tarnished America’s reputation and credibility.""

And Ukraine is now paying the price.

Due to the Biden administration’s failure in leadership, the United States has never looked weaker. Putin knows this, of course, and he is using the opportunity to expand his legacy, along with Russia’s borders.

Republicans have undoubtedly made some foreign policy mistakes in recent decades. But when it comes to the chaos we’re seeing in Ukraine today, Democrats, especially presidents Clinton, Obama, and Biden, deserve the lion’s share of the blame. The people of Ukraine are suffering as a result of their failures.

357,New giant dinosaur discovered in Russia,Walt Bonner,"

A new kind of giant dinosaur has been described in Russia. Dubbed Volgatitan, the herbivore belonged to a family of long-necked dinosaurs called sauropods. It weighed 17 tons and walked the earth 200 million to 65 million years ago.

The enormous dinosaur was identified from seven of its vertebrae, which had been stuck in a cliff for 130 million years until they were discovered on the banks of the Volga river near Ulyanovsk in 1982.

“[The fossils] come from a cliff of marine sediments which are rich in invertebrate fossils such as ammonite and bones [of] marine reptiles,” study author Dr. Alexander Averianov of the Russian Academy of Sciences told Fox News.

180-MILLION-YEAR-OLD 'SEA MONSTER' FOUND WITH SKIN AND BLUBBER

Averianov’s co-author Vladimir Efimov found the first three giant vertebrae after they fell out of the cliff in the early ’80s. A few years later, more limestone from the cliff broke off containing the remaining vertebrae. Efimov published a short note about the discovery in 1997, describing his discovery as “giant vertebrae of unknown taxonomic affiliation.”

The bones sat for 20 years until they were re-examined by Averianov.

“I started my work on sauropods quite recently, published on sauropod remains from the Late Cretaceous of Uzbekistan and describing the first sauropod taxa from Russia, Tengrisaurus and Sibirotitan, in 2017 and 2018 respectively,” Averianov said. “I decided to also study the fossils reported by Efimov and visited his museum in July 2017 and examined the fossils.”

'UNICORN' FROM THE ICE AGE MAY HAVE EXISTED AT THE SAME TIME AS HUMANS, SHOCKING DISCOVERY REVEALS

Upon inspecting the bones, he noticed the caudal vertebrae’s unusual morphology.

“[After] checking the literature when I returned home, [I] confirmed that this is a new taxon of titanosaurian sauropods,” Averianov recounted. A taxon refers to a specific group.

Titanosaurs were the last surviving group of the giant long-necked dinosaurs and were some of the largest land animals known to have lived. It was previously believed that Titanosaurs’ evolution took place mainly in South America in the Early Cretaceous before some taxa migrated to North America, Europe and Asia in the Late Cretaceous. However, this new discovery in Russia shows that Titanosaurs were more widely distributed in the Early Cretaceous and that some of their important evolutionary stages may have happened in Eastern Europe and Asia.

ENORMOUS 20,000-POUND 'RHINO ELEPHANT’ ROAMED THE TRIASSIC

Weighing in at 17 tons, Volgatitan’s not even close to being the largest titan of the Titanosaurs.

“The largest members of this lineage reached 50-70 tons, but they lived much later, in the Late Cretaceous period,” Averianov explained. “Volgatitan is one of the oldest titanosaurian sauropods which lived in the beginning of the Early Cretaceous period, some 130 million years ago. However, it is quite large comparative to other earliest Cretaceous sauropods.”

Averianov hopes to describe yet another new taxon of another dinosaur next, this one pretty famous as far as iconic dinos go.

“We are currently working on the dinosaurs collected from the Early Cretaceous site in Yakutia, Eastern Siberia,” he said. “The fauna is dominated by stegosaurs and possibly we shall describe a new taxon of stegosaur when all specimens will be prepared.”

The study can be found in the latest issue of Biological Communications.

358,5 inconvenient truths about Che Guevara,Maxim Lott,"

T-shirts featuring Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara have never really gone out of style. Rapper Jay-Z has worn the shirt, model Gisele Bundchen has posed in swimwear featuring Che's face, and even Prince Harry was photographed in Che garb in his younger years.

Multiple Hollywood films glorify the Argentina-born Cuban revolutionary, transforming him over the decades into somewhat of a pop-culture fixture – whose face still symbolizes for many the fight against the supposed capitalist machine, at a time when socialism is picking up renewed popularity in America.

TOP 5 FAILED SOCIALIST PROMISES

But Guevara's fans might not be aware of just what their idol did and said. Here’s a look back at the history.

Guevara said he killed people without regard to guilt or innocence

In 1962, the official Cuban newspaper Revolución reported that Guevara said, “in times of excessive tension we cannot proceed weakly. At the Sierra Maestra, we executed many people by ﬁring squad without knowing if they were fully guilty. At times, the Revolution cannot stop to conduct much investigation; it has the obligation to triumph.”

In his own diaries, Guevara waxed poetic: “I see it printed in the night sky that I ... howling like one possessed, will assault the barricades or the trenches, will take my bloodstained weapon and, consumed with fury, slaughter any enemy who falls into my hands.”

He later wrote in one of his diaries about how he shot a peasant who admitted leaking information to the enemy. “He gasped for a little while and was dead,” Guevara wrote. “To execute a human being is something ugly, but [also] exemplary.”

Thousands were killed by the Cuban regime, with many killings linked to Guevara.

WHAT DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM REALLY MEANS

“He was directly responsible for at least 124 killings,” Maria Werlau, author of the book “Che Guevara’s Forgotten Victims,” who has spent years documenting the specific people killed at Guevara's orders, told Fox News.

His defenders say he did what was necessary for a revolution.

“Yes, my father killed – but revolutions are almost always violent,” Guevara's daughter, who lives in Cuba, said in a speech in England in 2012.

Guevara created system that put gay people in labor camps

In Guevara’s diaries, he wrote of one man who, “apart from being homosexual and a first-rate bore, had been very nice to us.”

But Guevara's diary quip also spilled into reality.

“The regime that Che Guevara co-founded is the only one in modern history in the Western Hemisphere to have herded gays into forced labor camps,” Humberto Fontova, author of “Exposing the Real Che Guevara,” told Fox News.

Guevara set up Cuba’s first forced labor camp for people viewed by the state as delinquents. One journalist who managed to see such camps reported that inmates worked 60 hours per week, guarded by men with guns, and were paid almost nothing.

Gay people were among many targeted groups. People who had other “decadent” capitalist cultural practices could also be targeted.

“You see all these rock n’ roll bands [praising Che] like Rage Against the Machine and Carlos Santana – folks, they are eulogizing the emblem of a regime that made it a criminal offense to listen their music!” Fontova said.

Guevara opposed a free press

In 1959, leftist journalist José Pardo Llada reported that Guevara told him: “We must eliminate all newspapers; we cannot make a revolution with free press. Newspapers are instruments of the oligarchy.”

Fontova says that was in line with Che’s actions.

“When Che Guevara first arrived in Havana, he moved into the biggest, most luxurious mansion in the city. A Cuban journalist, Antonio Llano Montes, wrote about it in 1959. Naturally, Che Guevara's goons paid him a little visit,” Fontova noted.

Montes, recounting the incident from abroad in a 1984 book titled ""La Dinastía,"" reported that Guevara's men took him to Che, who then gave him an ominous show of signing 26 execution approvals in front of him. Montes reported that Guevara then threatened him, saying: ""I can have you shot this very night, what do you think?""

Montes wrote that Guevara left it at the threat, however, and the journalist quickly fled the country.

Guevara made racist statements

In Che Guevara’s diary, he wrote of “the blacks” living in Caracas, Venezuela, calling them “those magnificent examples of the African race who have maintained their racial purity thanks to their lack of an affinity with bathing.”

Guevara went on to write: “the black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving.”

Fontova says Guevara’s actions – in his revolution against the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista – were worse than his remarks.

“Many of the people Che was sending to the firing squad were members of Batista’s army, and these disproportionately tended to be black and mulatto. Batista himself was mulatto.”

Batista had been considered by many Cubans to be a friend of Cuba’s black minority, and had elevated several to prominent posts in government.

“The lilly-white Che Guevara and Fidel Castro overthrew the mixed-race Batista,” Fontova said.

Guevara also at times, however, called for more blacks to be represented in institutions and had black fighters under his command.

A messiah complex

Guevara’s diaries contain grandiose wording, casting himself as a savior absolving the sins of privilege with bloodshed.

Guevara wrote of a night where, talking to a fellow communist by a lamppost, a vision came to him offering clarity.

“I now knew… that when the great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I would be with the people,” he wrote.

“I see myself ... the great equalizer of individual will, proclaiming the ultimate mea culpa [apology]. I feel my nostrils dilate, savoring the acrid smell of gunpowder and blood, the enemy’s death; I steel my body, ready to do battle, and prepare myself to be a sacred space within which the bestial howl of the triumphant proletariat can resound...” Guevara went on.

“His arrogance – that is one thing that everyone agrees on,” Fontova said.

The parable that “those who live by the sword, die by the sword” also applies to Guevara.

After helping to establish socialism in Cuba, Guevara traveled to other countries to launch more revolts. His last attempt was in Bolivia, where he surrendered to Bolivian soldiers after a battle and was then executed, without a trial, on orders from the Bolivian government.

""This gives me so much anxiety,"" Meghan McCain responded. ""This is like how my 16 year old niece would answer this question.""

'Outkick’ founder and podcast host Clay Travis tweeted, ""If you're confused about what's going on in Ukraine and have an IQ of 14, Kamala Harris is here for you.""

Washington Examiner executive editor Seth Mandel called Harris’ explanation of the war ""terrifying.""

""She just has a real inability to talk normally to [people],"" Mandel wrote. ""Layman’s terms doesn’t mean ‘assume the audience has never heard of Russia...'""

""Apparently Vice President Kamala Harris believes the average American layperson is aged 4,"" The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech echoed. ""You will hear higher levels of explanation of international affairs in Peppa Pig.""

Former Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway called Harris’ response ""embarrassing,"" remarking that it's ""No wonder staffers smarter than her have quit.""

""They were so happy to have us,"" Wali told the CBC of the people who greeted the former soldiers with hugs as they entered Ukraine. ""It's like we were friends right away.""

Wali, 40, has a young family and works as a civilian computer programmer. He said the ""hardest part"" of making the decision to join the war was missing his son’s first birthday.

""A week ago, I was still programming stuff,"" he said. ""Now I’m grabbing anti-tank missiles in a warehouse to kill real people. … That’s my reality right now.""

361,"Russian failures in Ukraine leave ‘no option for a possible victory,’ alleged FSB whistleblower says",Louis Casiano,"

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in unforeseen obstacles and challenges that make victory a near impossibility as casualties continue to mount amid crippling sanctions, according to a letter purportedly authored by a Russian intelligence analyst in one of Moscow's security agencies.

The more than 2,000-word report by a whistleblower in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), the successor agency to the KGB, said the number of Russians killed in the conflict could number 10,000, a figure in line with Ukrainian estimates and in stark contrast to the 498 reported by the Kremlin last week.

The report said Russia doesn't have an accurate number of its death count after losing contact with military units inside the country.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

The author said the FSB was being blamed for Moscow's failures in fending off Ukrainian defense forces, while the agency was not given advance warning about the invasion. Russia was also unprepared to deal with the effects of the global sanctions it now faces as the ruble continues to plunge, the letter said.

""No one knew that there would be such a war, so no one prepared for such sanctions,"" the report said. ""It’s just that there is no option for a possible victory.""

Meanwhile, officers were pressured to tailor reports to the narrative desired by Russian leaders.

""We have been increasingly pressed to customize reports to the requirements of management - I once touched on this topic,"" the author claims. ""All these political consultants, politicians and their retinue, influence teams - all this created chaos.""

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A ‘VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD’

""Now, even if Zelensky is killed, taken prisoner, nothing will change,"" the report said. ""And now even those who were loyal to us are against it. Because it was planned from above, because we were told that there would be no such option, unless we were attacked.

""Even with minimum resistance from the Ukrainians we'd need over 500,000 people, not including supply and logistics workers,"" the author claims.

The letter also compared Russia's failure to conquer Ukraine with the mistake made by Nazi Germany in World War II. The author said it remains to be seen whether leaders will start a conflict with Europe in an effort to reduce the sanctions.

""Now I do not rule out that then we will be drawn into a real international conflict, like (former Nazi German leader Adolf) Hitler in 1939. And then our (pro-Russian) Z (symbol) will be compared to us with a swastika.""

Vladimir Osechkin, founder of the Gulagu.net group, published the report on his Facebook page last week. Christo Grozev, who works for the Netherlands-based investigative journalism group Bellingcat, tweeted that he showed the letter to two FSB contacts, one current and one former employee. They had no doubt that the author was a colleague, he said.

Grozev was skeptical about its authenticity but said the ""letter appeared different"" in that it came from a reputable source and was ""way longer than a forger would choose to make it.""

Still, the letter could be part of a disinformation attempt from Ukraine, said Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America."" She cited several details in the letter that appeared to be suspicious.

""Both sides right now are waging information warfare on each other,"" she told Fox News. ""It's very long and incorporates all kinds of things. If he's really an FSB officer in the middle of this conflict right now, who has the time to write such a long post that would incorporate all these various things?""

She cited the author's reference to Hitler as one example.

""The Hitler thing. This is a Western narrative,"" she added. ""The Russians hate Hitler, but it's unlikely for them to compare Putin with Hitler.""

The author of the letter addressed whether Putin would initiate a nuclear strike against the West.

""Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike? Yes. Not for military purposes (it will not give anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but with the aim of intimidating others,"" the report said.

He added that the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service, was ""digging the earth"" for evidence that Ukraine has secretly created nuclear weapons to justify such a strike.

362,China accuses US of ‘biological military activities’ in Ukraine,Michael Ruiz,"

China is backing Russia’s claims about U.S.-controlled ""biolabs"" in Ukraine conducting ""biological military activities"" – accusations the White House and Ukraine have both denied.

The allegations come two weeks into Vladimir Putin's invasion of his smaller neighbor.

""According to data released by the US, it has 26 bio-labs and other related facilities in Ukraine, over which the US Department of Defense has absolute control,"" Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, said during a news conference Tuesday. ""All dangerous pathogens in Ukraine must be stored in these labs and all research activities are led by the US side. Without US approval, no information shall be released to the public.""

Zhao was echoing claims from his Russian counterpart Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova, who said Kremlin troops found evidence that Ukrainians are covering up evidence of ""military biological programs"" in fear that the invading army will learn more. U.S. officials have said the idea is ""absurd"" and that Russia could be using it as cover ahead of a possible chemical or biological attack on Ukraine.

China has also struggled to fend off concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may have originated in a lab in its city of Wuhan.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""According to reports, a large quantity of dangerous viruses are stored in these facilities,"" Zhao said. ""Russia has found during its military operations that the US uses these facilities to conduct bio-military plans.""

He said Beijing, which has still refrained from describing Russia’s war on Ukraine as an ""invasion,"" was calling on ""relevant sides to ensure the safety of these labs.""

""The US, in particular, as the party that knows the labs the best, should disclose specific information as soon as possible, including which viruses are stored and what research has been conducted,"" he said, claiming the alleged Ukraine labs were ""the tip of the iceberg"" and that the U.S. had hundreds more around the world.

""The US has 336 biological labs in 30 countries under its control -- 336, you heard me right,"" he claimed. ""It also conducted many biological military activities at the Fort Detrick base at home.""

RUSSIA'S CLAIM ON US AND UKRAINE BIOLABS ‘ABSURD’ AND ‘UNTRUE’: US DEFENSE OFFICIAL

Fort Detrick is the home of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command in Maryland.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the claims of a global network of U.S.-run biological weapons labs ""preposterous"" Wednesday.

""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,"" she said. ""It’s a clear pattern, and no one should fall for it.""

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the U.S. has led an international effort to secure and dismantle leftover Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction, including in Ukraine. In August 2005, Washington and Kyiv agreed to cooperate to prevent the ""proliferation of technology, pathogens and expertise that could be used in the development of biological weapons.""

WHITE HOUSE WARNS RUSSIA COULD USE CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS IN UKRAINE

The agreement required Ukraine to ""consolidate and store"" any dangerous pathogens it possessed in centralized facilities and required the country’s Ministry of Health to inform the DOD if it had to move them temporarily ""due to emergency situations."" It also allowed the U.S. and Ukraine to work together on public health research.

As early as May 2020, Ukrainian officials called reports of American military biolabs within their borders ""fake news,"" the Kyiv Post reported at the time.

Russia, on the other hand, has a history of violating international laws governing biological and chemical weapons, Psaki said – citing the attempted poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny and Russia’s support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, who has used chemical weapons to quell domestic rebellions.

Still, Zhao accused the U.S. of ""stonewalling"" and dismissing China and Russia’s claims as ""spreading disinformation.""

""It’s exactly the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries around the world, which have been debunked conclusively, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,"" she said. ""The United States is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.""

DUAL RUSSIAN-US CITIZEN CHARGED WITH ACTING AS KREMLIN SPY

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby also addressed the claims Wednesday, saying they were ""malarkey"" and ""classic Russian propaganda.""

""We are not developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine,"" he said. ""It's not happening.""

However, the claims generated renewed interest Tuesday when Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. was concerned about Russian troops seizing ""biological research facilities"" in Ukraine.

UKRAINE SAYS IT SANK THE RUSSIAN WARSHIP THAT ATTACKED SNAKE ISLAND: ‘WE F------ HIT THEM!’

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, had asked her if Ukraine has chemical or biological weapons.

""Ukraine has biological research facilities,"" Nuland replied, ""which in fact we are quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.""

Rubio then asked whether Nuland believed Ukraine would conduct a biological attack within its own borders.

""I’m sure you’re aware that the Russian propaganda groups [are] already putting out there all kinds of information about how they’ve uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country, with NATO’s coordination,"" Rubio said. ""If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it?""

363,"Biden, in 1992, touted crime bill does ‘everything but hang people for jaywalking’",Adam Shaw,"

Former Vice President Joe Biden is facing renewed scrutiny about his stance on the death penalty amid a re-surfaced video from the '90s in which he boasted that sweeping crime legislation he helped write did “everything but hang people for jaywalking.”

The 2020 presidential hopeful is struggling to thread the needle between embracing his decades-long experience in the Senate, where he gained a reputation as a centrist Democrat, and connecting with a party base that has moved increasingly left on numerous issues including law and order.

BIDEN, UNDER FIRE FOR COMMENTS ON SEGREGATIONISTS, GAVE EULOGIES FOR STROM THURMOND, ROBERT BYRD

On top of controversial remarks this week over his past work with segregationist senators, comments talking up the 1994 crime bill risk exposing the primary front-runner as out of step with modern-day Democrats.

In the 1992 remarks, Biden was trying to battle accusations that the bill was “weak” on crime.

“Let me tell you what is in the bill, and I’ll let you all decide whether or not this is ‘weak,’” he said.

“It provides 53 death penalty offenses, as weak as can be, you know? We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill -- that’s weak stuff,” he said sarcastically.

The video was published online by the Republican National Committee, which is eager to stoke a bruising Democratic primary battle.

The clip speaks to yet another policy position where Biden may be shifting.

Amid widespread rejection of the death penalty by other 2020 primary candidates and criticism over the 1994 crime bill, Biden this month appeared to soften his stance on the death penalty. Politico reports that in New Hampshire this month, while defending the crime bill, he advocated for criminal justice reforms and highlighted his work during the Obama administration to cut the federal prison population.

“By the way, congratulations to ya’ll for ending the death penalty here,” he added.

Politico notes that as recently as 2000, Biden said that “I support the death penalty” but added that “you had better go out of your way to make sure you don’t execute an innocent person.”

Biden could face pressure to modify his stance further amid a primary field packed with candidates calling to abolish the death penalty, give the vote to felons, and shorten prison sentences as part of criminal justice reform.

BIDEN DEFIANT AS RIVALS SLAM REMARKS ON SEGREGATIONISTS: 'APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT?'

Biden already has faced criticism as he changed his stance on the Hyde Amendment that prevents federal funds being used for abortions.

And this week, he faced a firestorm over comments he made about being able to work with segregationist Democrats and get “things done,” as he warned fellow Democrats about the importance of working with people with whom they disagree.

He brushed off calls from other 2020 hopefuls for him to apologize, saying there's “not a racist bone in my body.”

That has, in turn, brought renewed attention to his 2003 eulogy for Strom Thurmond, the former South Carolina senator and “Dixiecrat” presidential candidate who supported segregation.

In the eulogy more than 15 years ago for Thurmond, who later became a Republican, Biden said that while their “differences were profound,” he got to know him and “watched him change, oh so subtly.”

“I went to the Senate emboldened, angered and outraged at age 29 about the treatment of African-Americans in this country, about everything for a period in his life Strom represented. But then I met the man,” Biden said at the time.

Biden will travel to South Carolina on Friday to make appeals to African-Americans. He is scheduled to meet with black leaders behind closed doors.

Then on Saturday, he will speak to abortion rights activists at a Planned Parenthood forum, where he is likely to clarify his switching stances on the Hyde Amendment.

364,Tucker Carlson: Someone needs to explain why there are dangerous biological weapons in Ukraine,Tucker Carlson,"

If you had told us just four days ago that the Biden administration was funding secret bio labs in Ukraine of all places, we would not have believed you. Yeah, I don't think we're going to put that on TV. No thanks.

Then, if you told us that not only did the administration fund these secret bio labs in Ukraine, but that they then failed to secure the deadly contents of those labs before the Russian invasion—an invasion they knew was coming, an invasion they helped encourage—if you had told us that four days ago, we would have dismissed you as a nut. It was just too preposterous. We will not want anything to do with a story like that. There was no way it could be true. It was too far out. In any case, we already knew for a fact that that story was false. How do we know that? Because we read USA Today, America's newspaper.

Within hours of the Russian invasion , USA Today published a rebuttal to all those crazies who were yammering on about secret Ukrainian bio labs. Here was the headline: ""Fact check: False claim of US biolabs in Ukraine tied to Russian disinformation campaign.""

AMERICAN COUPLE DESPERATE TO FINISH ADOPTING UKRAINE KIDS AS WAR RAGES

So, if you look carefully at the story—and we did because we were interested—you notice that this fact check was sourced to Ukrainian government unnamed officials and then Biden State Department officials. These were not exactly objective sources on this subject, but still the story seemed definitive. It was totally emphatic. ""Russia has teamed up with China to further amplify the false claim of U.S. labs in Ukraine.""

OK. USA Today says it's Russian disinformation. Maybe it is. On to the next story, but the fact checks didn't stop. That was weird. We kept seeing the same check again and again. It was almost like despite endless official clarification, some people refused to believe the Biden administration. They preferred Russian propaganda instead and we assume they must be QAnon members. We assume that because Foreign Policy Magazine told us that. According to Foreign Policy, QAnon, whatever that is, was frantically disseminating ""false claims of U.S. bio warfare labs in Ukraine.""

Those labs obviously didn't exist. It was all just another lie from the Russians who lie for a living. Then the European Union... weighed in, throwing its credibility behind the same claim. These are conspiracy theories, the EU told us, they're lies spread by Putin. An EU spokesmen then reminded us that, ""the credibility of information provided by the Kremlin is in general, very doubtful and low."" That was good to know.

""Russian disinformation has a track record of promoting manipulative narratives about biological weapons and alleged secret labs.""

Yeah. We're not going to do a segment about secret labs in Ukraine. Last thing we want to do on this show is traffic in Russian disinformation spread by QAnon, so we took a pass on that story. And that's where things stood until yesterday when we happened to tune in to a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Toria Nuland was testifying so we were interested. Nuland was one of the people who brought us the Iraq War, never apologized for that and kept getting promoted because that's how DC works. Toria Nuland is now Joe Biden's Under Secretary of State in charge of Ukraine and she knows a lot about Ukraine.

RUSSIAN OLIGARCH RENOUNCES CITIZENSHIP, SAYS IT HAS ‘BECOME A STAMP OF SHAME’

In 2014, Toria Nuland engineered a coup in Ukraine in the name of democracy, of course. So, she is a highly informed source about Ukraine. So, she was having this colloquy with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during her testimony, and at one point, Rubio took a tack that we were not expecting at all. He asked Nuland if Ukraine had biological weapons.

We never imagined Ukraine would have biological weapons. Why would Ukraine have bioweapons? So, it seemed like a pretty strange question, but it wasn't half as shocking as the answer he got. Here's what Toria Nuland said.

SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?

VICTORIA NULAND: Ukraine has a biological research facilities, which, In fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of. So, we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.

Does Ukraine have biological weapons? Ugh, Ukraine has biological research facilities. What? You mean secret bio labs like the secret bio labs that Ukraine definitely doesn't have? Ukraine has those? Yes, it does. And not only does Ukraine have secret bio labs, Toria Nuland said, whatever they're doing in those labs is so dangerous and so scary that she is, ""quite concerned"" that the so-called research material inside those bio labs might fall into the hands of Russian forces.

UKRAINE WAR: MORE THAN 1 MILLION CHILDREN HAVE FLED UKRAINE SINCE START OF RUSSIAN INVASION

Try not to use profanity on the air to describe our reaction. Our jaws dropped, let's leave it there. Under oath in an open committee hearing, Toria Nuland just confirmed that the Russian disinformation they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy theory and crazy and immoral to believe is, in fact, totally and completely true.

Woah, you don't hear things like that every day in Washington. Talk about a showstopper and a dozen questions instantly jump to mind. What exactly are they doing in these secret Ukrainian bio labs? Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe. It's hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We're assuming these weren't pharmaceutical labs, probably not developing new Leukemia drugs. From your answer, Toria Nuland, we would assume because you all but said it, that there's a military application to this research, that they were working on bioweapons. Again, your answer suggests that.

Why would we fund something like that in Ukraine, and why didn't you secure the contents of these bio labs before the Russians arrived as you knew they would? And then why did you go out of your way to lie to the American public about all of this? If the ""research materials"" in these labs were to escape somehow and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world? How can we prepare for the consequences of that, this thing that you're worried about? Shouldn't we be preparing? Because as it turns out, we've just spent the last two years living with the pathogen that began in another foreign bio lab funded by the United States government secretly.

So, this question is on our mind. It seems fair. Now that's some of what we would have asked if we were U.S. Senators, which were not. Yes, there's a time limit. Time limit be damned because this is kind of important, but Rubio did not ask those questions. Instead, he changed the subject and told us once again that Vladimir Putin is bad.

SEN. MARCO RUBIO: If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or... attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100%, it would be the Russians that would be behind it?

VICTORIA NULAND: There is no doubt in my mind, senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning to do themselves.

US NUCLEAR EXPERTS ‘MINDFUL BUT NOT FEARFUL’ OF RADIOACTIVE THREAT AMID RUSSIA INVASION OF UKRAINE

OK, just get a pen. It's a classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy, what they are planning to do themselves. That's what Toria Nuland said. We almost laughed out loud. So, what you're saying, Toria Nuland, if, for example, you were funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but wanted to hide that fact from the people who are paying for it, in whose name you were doing it, then you might lie about it by claiming the Russians were lying about it. In other words, you might mount a disinformation campaign by claiming the other guy was mounting a disinformation campaign. Is that what you're saying, Toria Nuland? It's pretty funny.

What's not funny is that this is all entirely real. We invited Marco Rubio on the show tonight to tell us what he knows about these bio labs. He declined to come. That invitation remains open. In the meantime, let's review what little we do know about this. We're going to start with a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday. Now, we would never do this. We never played anything like this on the show before because of course, we're Americans and when we want to know what's going on we ask our own officials, the people we elect and whose salaries we pay, because it's our country.

We don't go to foreign sources because we trust our own sources first. But when it turns out the people who represent us and run our government are lying to us and never apologize for it and doing horrific things in our names, then you have to open your mind a little bit and at least assess what other people are saying. So, here was the Russian claim.

IGOR KONASHENKOV: During the course of the special military operation, facts were uncovered of the key regime, mopping up traces of military biological program under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry.

OK. So, that apparently—we hadn't seen that until this afternoon we started poking around—that may have been the root of the conspiracy theories that the fact checks told us were Russian disinformation. Let's quote it: ""Military biological programs are under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry."" That's the Russian claim.

Separately, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Ukrainians were working on deadly pathogens, including plague and anthrax. Is that true? Now, obviously, we would not take Russia's word for that ever, but we don't have to take Russia's word for that. The U.S. Defense Department has a website that contains this media clip about the opening of a biological research facility in Ukraine in 2010.

RUSSIA CONFIRMS USE OF THERMOBARIC ‘VACUUM BOMBS’ IN UKRAINE, UK SAYS

""U.S. Senator Dick Lugar applauded the opening of the Interim Central Reference Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, this week, announcing that it will be instrumental in researching dangerous pathogens used by bioterrorists. The level-3 bio-safety lab will be used to study anthrax, tularemia and Q Fever, as well as other dangerous pathogens.""

Oh, OK. Then the National Pulse dug up 2011 report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences that also explained that the Odessa based laboratory ""is responsible for the identification of especially dangerous biological pathogens."" So, what we're doing—this is not the first time you've heard this story—we are funding the creation of deadly pathogens so we can study them and prevent people from getting infected with them. Maybe? There are lots of examples of this. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has a handy web page explaining that American and Ukrainian scientists have worked on a whole bunch of different experiments like this.

Some of the projects include work on African swine fever virus, hemorrhagic fever virus, and various respiratory viruses. The interesting thing, the telling thing, is that the U.S. Embassy's website also contains links to fact sheets about America's support for biological research in Ukraine, but all those links are now dead. That's weird. It's our government. We pay for it. Again, they're there in our name, in the name of American citizens, but we can no longer read their web page. How does that work, exactly? They have no right to lie to us.

The web page is archived, thankfully, and the fact sheets show Defense Department funding to laboratories in Ukraine. So that looks like proof. It's not Russian disinformation. It's totally real. Sorry USA Today, America's newspaper, it's real. You can look it up on the internet if you want. In the face of that evidence, the Pentagon is still lying about and in fact, they're repeating the same unbelievably stupid and now thoroughly discredited lies the fact checkers have told for weeks now. Here's the spokesman for the Pentagon , John Kirby, today.

JOHN KIRBY: The Russian accusations are absurd. They're laughable and, you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda and I wouldn't, if I were you,...I wouldn't give it a drop of ink worth...paying attention to.

REPORTER: Yeah, but can you explain to us what...has there been any relationship between the...?

JOHN KIRBY: We are not, not, developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine. It's not happening.

US REJECTS POLISH PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER MIG-29 PLANES TO UKRAINE, CALLS MOVE ‘HIGH-RISK.’

If I were you, I wouldn't devote a drop of ink to it. First of all, you didn't get to make that decision, Mr. Bureaucrat. We have a free press in this country. You don't get to decide, but you'll notice at the end of that, Kirby refuses to answer the question. Has there been any relationship between the U.S. Pentagon and a bioweapons facility in Ukraine and if so, what is that relationship? That's Russian disinformation! What's the answer? We're not developing WMD in Ukraine right now! OK, got it, but why are we funding this and what exactly are we funding?

We reached out to the State Department separately and they provided us with this very carefully worded statement: ""The U.S. Department of Defense does not own or operate biological laboratories in Ukraine."" Not that anyone said they did. Continuing the quote, ""Undersecretary Nuland was referring to Ukrainian diagnostic and biodefense laboratories during her testimony, which are not biological weapons facilities."" What's the difference exactly? Continuing the quote, ""These institutions counter biological threats throughout the country.""

So that means nothing. You could describe our nuclear stockpile correctly as defensive. Our nuclear weapons are not designed to preemptively kill anybody. They're designed to prevent other people from killing us, but they're still nuclear weapons. So, when you stop lying and telling us what's going on here and why don't you more specifically tell us why you didn't secure these materials? So, yes, we're funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but they are diagnostic and biodefense laboratories that counter biological threats.

OK, if these are purely defensive labs, why was Toria Nuland so concerned that Russians would get ahold of the materials from these facilities? Other world powers have come to the obvious conclusion. Again, we hate to do this, but under these circumstances, we asked our own spokespeople, they lied. We're going to the Foreign Ministry of China , a country we despise. Here's what they said today. They're calling on weapons inspectors to take a look at these facilities in Ukraine right away.

ZHAO LIJIAN: Over the past two decades, the United States has been blocking the establishment of a verification regime to the Biological Weapons Convention and refused to accept the inspection of biological facilities within and outside its borders. The move has further aggravated the concern of the international community. We, once again, urge the U.S. to provide full clarification of its bio militarization activities within and outside its borders and accept multilateral verification.

Oh, they're putting Russian and Chinese propaganda on the screen! Yeah, we did. We also put U.S. government propaganda on the screen and the difference is we expect to be lied to by foreign governments. We're not globalists. We believe in one country. It's this country, the United States. We do not expect to be lied to by our government and we won't accept it. But let's get to the substance of what the Chinese government just said. We never agree with the Chinese government on anything, but in this case, they make a fair point. We now know that dangerous biological agents, whether you call them weapons or not is completely irrelevant because they can be used as weapons. Is a gun a weapon? Not when you're quail hunting. When you're in a gunfight, it is. It's a ridiculous semantic debate.

Dangerous biological agents remain, thanks to the Biden administration, unsecured in a chaotic war zone. At some point we need to know how that happened, who made those decisions. We have a right to know and let's hope someone in Congress, probably not Marco Rubio, but someone else, will get to the bottom of it, but in the meantime, we pray that somewhere, in the United States government, there as an adult who cares enough to get this situation under control immediately.

369,Georgia educator suspended after restraining student in possession of loaded gun,Emma Colton,"

A Georgia high school athletic director was suspended after he defended himself and restrained a student who was in possession of a loaded weapon in school.

""I don't feel like I did anything wrong,"" Tri-Cities High School coach Kenneth Miller said, according to News 19 . ""I only adhered to what Fulton County School Board Policy says you're allowed to do.""

Miller said that on Aug. 20 of last year, the school’s principal called him to her office about reports of students on campus with guns .

FLORIDA WOMAN THREATENS TO USE GUN AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE

""During that process, we located guns. We saved lives,"" Miller told Fox 5.

Miller confronted one female student while in the presence of police officers. Miller and the officers were unaware the student, who eyewitnesses described as belligerent and aggressive, had a gun at the time of the confrontation.

The situation escalated when the student hit Miller with a stapler, News 19 reported. Miller then grabbed the girl and restrained her until officers stepped in and took her into custody .

A loaded gun was later found in her backpack. Another gun was also found that day, according to Miller, but it’s unclear if the same girl was in possession of that gun.

""I'm OK with him standing up for those children,"" a supporter of Miller, Kavon Smith Arnold, told Fox 5. ""What I'm not OK with is him being railroaded, because at the end of the day teachers are put in very uncompromising positions to take care of our children.""

ST. LOUIS SECOND-GRADER BROUGHT GUN TO SCHOOL, DISTRICT SAYS

Miller was initially fired, but the school district later reversed the decision to a suspension which has lasted months, News 19 reported.

""The district administration does not support Mr. Miller’s actions relating to this event and believes his conduct failed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees. Mr. Miller inappropriately intervened in a student matter being handled by school administrators and law enforcement. Mr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities,"" Fulton County Schools said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

""Mr. Miller’s conduct resulted in an escalation of a physical altercation with a student in crisis, which conflicts with district expectations to deescalate in these types of situations. Mr. Miller has not exhausted his due process rights at this time and remains on full, paid administrative leave.""

Miller’s lawyer called on school systems to support teachers who ""get put in terribly dangerous situations.""

370,House passes bill offering nearly $14 billion in aid to Ukraine,Timothy Nerozzi,"

The House of Representatives voted to approve a $1.5. trillion spending bill that funds the government through Sept. 30 and includes $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine amid the war with Russia.

The defense portion passed by a vote of 361-69, and the domestic portion passed by a vote of 260-171 with one present vote.

The House voted after months of stalling and debate as Congress faced a Friday deadline to approve government funding or risk a shutdown.

In an earlier version of the bill released early Wednesday morning, there was a $15 billion appropriation for pandemic relief. But because of internal friction among Democrats and opposition from Republicans, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was forced to push back the expected vote on the package and remove the COVID-19 funds.

TOP LAWMAKERS REACH DEAL ON UKRAINE AID, $1.5T SPENDING

As a result, Democrats missed their planned departure to Philadelphia on Wednesday for a conference retreat. Members told Fox News Digital that delays surrounding the bill had to do with major concerns about coronavirus funding, as well as defense spending levels and the short amount of time to review the contents of the 2,741-page measure just hours before they were expected to approve it.

""It is heartbreaking to remove the COVID funding, and we must continue to fight for urgently needed COVID assistance, but unfortunately that will not be included in this bill,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a Wednesday letter to her fellow Democrats.

""Because of Republican insistence — and the resistance by a number of our Members to making those offsets — we will go back to the Rules Committee to remove COVID funding and accommodate the revised bill. We must proceed with the omnibus today, which includes emergency funding for Ukraine and urgent funding to meet the needs of America’s families.""

Some members said they were very upset that states that California and New York were protected from the plan to offset the spending from other states. Republicans insisted that there be spending offsets in the legislation which meant that some COVID-19 spending was to be paid for with cuts to previously approved coronavirus aid to certain states.

371,Missiles fired toward US consulate in Iraq came from Iran: officials,Kyle Morris,"

A series of missiles were fired Sunday from Iran in the direction of the U.S. consulate in Erbil, Iraq, a senior U.S. official told Fox News.

The missiles numbered as many as 12, The Associated Press reported.

None of the missiles made contact with the consulate, the U.S. official told Fox News.

All U.S. personnel were accounted for at the consulate complex and no casualties were reported near the unmanned consulate in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq.

""There is no damage or casualties at any U.S. Government facility,"" a State Department spokesperson told Fox News. ""The incident is being investigated by the government of Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government and we refer you to them for comment. We condemn this outrageous attack and display of violence.""

REPUBLICANS CALL ON YELLEN TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER RUSSIAN MONEY FINANCED USA GREEN GROUPS

A national security official told Fox News there was no indication the missiles were intended for U.S. facilities.

The strike represented an escalation in hostilities between Iran and the U.S., which have been played out mostly inside Iraq, the AP reported.

Soon after the attack, satellite broadcast channel Kurdistan24, whose headquarters is located near the consulate, aired images of shattered glass and scattered debris on the floor of its studio, the AP reported.

The missile strike came several days after Iran said it would respond to an Israeli strike near Damascus, Syria, that resulted in the deaths of two members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, according to the AP.

Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported on Sunday's strike in Iraq but did not say where the missiles originated, the AP reported.

But one Iraqi official told the AP the missiles were fired from Iran and were Iranian-made Fateh-110s – and the strike likely represented a response to the Damascus attack.

Nuclear talks on ‘pause’

The Sunday strike also came as negotiations in Vienna, on the potential revival of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, hit a ""pause"" because of Russia's demands regarding economic sanctions it faces because of its invasion of Ukraine, according to the AP.

The U.S.military has shifted to a non-combat role in Iraq, but Iran and its allies still want the U.S. presence there to end, Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie said in December, according to the AP.

U.S. troops remaining in Iraq provide air support and other aid as the Iraqi military fights Islamic State forces, the report said.

372,US Army grants its first religious waiver for coronavirus vaccine exemption,Julia Musto,"

The U.S. Army has granted a soldier a permanent religion-based exemption from getting the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine.

New service data published on Friday showed the Army's updated COVID-19 vaccination statistics and exemption requests as of March 10, 2022, including 536 disapproved religion-based exemptions and 3,760 requests.

COVID LOCKDOWNS MAY BE ENDING, BUT WE ARE FOREVER CHANGED

There have been 2,791 refusals and 3,183 official reprimands, according to the exemption chart, and seven permanent medical exemptions have been approved.

""To date, Army commanders have relieved a total of six Regular Army leaders, including two battalion commanders, and issued 3,183 general officer written reprimands to Regular Army Soldiers for refusing the vaccination order,"" the Army's public affairs office wrote in a release.

As of March 3, the Army has not involuntarily separated any soldiers solely for refusing the legal order to receive the vaccine.

""As previously announced, Army officials have issued guidance for the mandatory initiation of separation for soldiers who refuse this lawful order,"" the office noted.

ARMY SOLDIERS WITHOUT COVID-19 VACCINE TO BEGIN SEPARATION PROCESS

The new waiver comes three months following the Army's deadline for active troops to become fully vaccinated against the virus.

According to Stars and Stripes, the Army is the Pentagon’s only service that has yet to remove vaccine refusers – even after Army Secretary Christine Wormuth ordered service commanders to begin the process to involuntarily separate those individuals ""as expeditiously as possible.""

""Army readiness depends on Soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation’s wars,"" she said then. ""Unvaccinated Soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness. We will begin involuntary separation proceedings for Soldiers who refuse the vaccine order and are not pending a final decision on an exemption.""

According to the January order, those denied exemptions to the Army’s vaccine mandate have seven calendar days to either start a COVID-19 vaccination regimen or file an appeal to the final appeal authority. If they fail to do so, they will face separation proceedings.

374,Kamala Harris says Dems’ task ahead of midterms is tell voters ‘they got what they ordered' on Biden promises,Marisa Schultz,"

Vice President Kamala Harris rallied Democrats at their winter meeting Saturday and said the big task of the midterms is to remind voters that the Biden-Harris administration largely delivered on their campaign promises.

""Our task is to show people that, in many ways, they got what they ordered,"" Harris told the Democratic National Committee (DNC) meeting.

Fresh off of her trip from Europe to address the Russia-Ukraine war, Harris said Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine threatens other democracies.

DEMOCRATS SEEK TO 'SELL' ACCOMPLISHMENTS AHEAD OF TOUGH MIDTERMS

""The ocean that separates us will not leave us untouched by this aggression,"" Harris said.

Reflecting on her meetings with allies in Europe, Harris said their greatest strength is unity and standing together in defense of democracy.

She affirmed the U.S. commitment to Ukraine as it fends off a brutal Russian invasion.

""The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people [and] in defense of the NATO Alliance,"" Harris said.

Harris's speech to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in Washington D.C. comes as faithful gear up for what is expected to be a tough midterm election season. It's the first time the hundreds of DNC members have gathered for an in-person event since 2019 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden addressed the roughly 415 members of the DNC Thursday night where he told them to be proud of what Democrats have accomplished since his presidency and to do a better job of selling the record to the American public.

HARRIS SAYS PUTIN TO FACE MORE PUNISHMENT FOR 'OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT ON BEHALF OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE' IN UKRAINE

""We have a record -- a record to be proud of; an agenda that addresses the biggest concerns here in America, in people’s lives; the message that resonates,"" Biden told the gathering at the Washington Hilton Hotel Thursday. ""Now what we have to do is we have to sell it with confidence, clarity, conviction, and repetition.""

While key parts of the Biden-Harris agenda failed in Congress, namely the Build Back Better social spending agenda and voting rights reforms – Harris said that Democrats still managed to do a lot. She touted the American Rescue Plan, job gains, school and businesses reopening from the pandemic and the bipartisan infrastructure act that she said will create more good-paying union jobs.

Harris praised the Democrats who voted in record numbers during the coronavirus pandemic and said now it is the time to remind them of those accomplishments.

""A lot of what they demanded they got and so let's get out there as we do and remind them … because we know that they will show up again,"" Harris said.

Republicans, however, seek to blame Biden and Harris for inflation and high gas prices that have hurt American families.

""Kamala Harris is returning to record gas prices, historic inflation, runaway crime, an open border, and a country moving in the wrong direction,"" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Emma Vaughn said in a statement. ""Biden and Harris have lost the trust of the American people — their agenda is destroying wallets, pitting Americans against each other, and weakening our standing on the world stage.""

Harris just returned to Washington early Saturday morning after traveling to Poland and Romania to demonstrate unity among NATO allies, show support for Ukraine and condemn Russia's unjustified war against the Ukrainian people.

Harris on Friday said the U.S. will take more action to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin faces ""serious consequence"" for his ""atrocious and outrageous conduct on behalf of the Russian people.""

KAMALA HARRIS RIPPED FOR LOOKING TO POLISH PRESIDENT FOR HELP ON QUESTION ABOUT UKRAINIAN REFUGEES

During a joint press conference in Bucharest, Romania, Friday alongside Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, Harris said it is ""painful"" to watch what is happening to Ukrainians.

Senior U.S. military officials pushed for additional special operations personnel to be sent to Ukraine in the lead up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the request was denied amid White House fears it could provoke Russia, according to a report.

As Russia stationed about 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine last year, U.S. military officials told lawmakers in December that a ""few hundred"" additional special operations personnel should be sent to the country to assist with military advice and training, Politico reported Sunday.

The personnel would have trained Ukrainians on guerrilla tactics and unconventional warfare methods. The training would have been different from the formal training at the Yavoriv Combat Training Center in western Ukraine, sources told the outlet.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin even planned to bring the matter directly to President Biden for approval, a pair of people familiar with two December briefings with lawmakers and congressional aides told Politico.

White House officials, however, were reportedly concerned that the deployment of additional personnel would hamper diplomacy efforts and escalate the situation. The plans were stopped in response to those fears, according to a congressional official familiar with a briefing delivered by a Pentagon official to the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""Based on either incorrect assumptions about what Vladimir Putin wanted to do or based upon worries about provoking Putin — he didn’t need any provoking! — it’s one example of these calculations leading to a more passive approach than we could have taken.""

Brase described the decision as ""diplomatic moves"" meant to protect members of the convoy.

Russia asked China for military and economic aid following their invasion of Ukraine, Fox News has confirmed.

In an attempt to protect intelligence sources, U.S. officials have been reluctant to detail what type of aid is being sought.

The request for military assistance, which was first reported by The New York Times, has reportedly raised concern among U.S. officials that China might interfere with any efforts from Western nations to assist Ukrainian forces.

""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he said.

Sullivan also suggested that China had some idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin was planning something, but conceded the Chinese might not have known the extent of Putin's intentions.

Chinese leaders have declined to rebuke Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, and have come out against Western economic sanctions. China has abstained in multiple United Nations votes to censure Russia.

Last Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed that ""China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda"" about the U.S. developing chemical weapons in Ukraine.

391,Russia's Putin looks to import Syrian mercenaries to do the 'dirty tricks' against Ukraine’s population,Benjamin Weinthal,"

As Russia’s war machine grinds into the third week of its brutal invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has launched a recruiting operation in the Syrian Arab Republic in an effort to attract reinforcements for his armed forces.

Commentators believe the announcement is in part due to Russia’s poor planning of the war, which has led to many Russian soldiers being killed. Last week a U.S official told CBS News the number of Russian deaths could be between 5,000 and 6,000.

Putin and his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, recently declared that as many as 16,000 combatants from the Middle East will enter the Ukrainian war on the side of Russia. The promised pay, according to news reports, is around $3,000 per month.

""It appears that Russia has opened 14 mercenary recruitment centers in Syria in territories controlled by the regime of Bashar al-Assad (Damascus, Aleppo, Hama, Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor),"" Theodore Karasik, a fellow on Russian and Middle Eastern Affairs at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, told Fox News Digital. ""After a short training, the mercenaries will be transported to Russia through the Khmeimim Air Base by two Tu-134 (up to 80 passengers) and Tu-154 (up to 180 passengers) aircraft to the Chkalovsky Air Base, Moscow region.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Karasik added that ""We need to be aware that there is an information war ongoing regarding the recruitment of fighters by multiple parties to this conflict. There is some evidence that these fighters will enter into the battle space in greater numbers in the coming weeks."" The battle space, he continued, ""is being prepared for partisan warfare and taking lessons learned from Grozny and Syria are going to be important for all actors. Recruitment drives are robust and supported by state actors.""

Grozny saw intensive urban warfare conducted by Russian forces during the initial stages of the First Chechen War in 1994-95 and the Second Chechen War in 1999-2000, with some military observers claiming they are now doing the same with Ukraine.

Karasik said the recruiting effort is about applying Syrian fighters’ capacity in another theater because of the experience they acquired in the long civil war. ""I think it's a mixed picture because of the multiple groups [in Syria] and how they’ve split and come back together again,"" he said. ""So really, it’s about the quality of the recruits, and what we need to look at next is who are they really sending? Who is signing up for this? How do they guarantee the quality of the fighters?""

Brig. Gen. Ahmad Rahal, who resigned in protest from the Syrian military in 2012 over the policies of President Bashar Assad and joined the opposition Free Syria Army, told Fox News Digital that the Russians will use the Syrian and other mercenaries to carry out the ""dirty tasks"" of fighting in the cities, which will lead to more civilian deaths and it will help them avoid being blamed for the war crimes.

""The Russian army is besieging most of the Ukrainian cities, and now it is taking the appropriate fighting arrangement around the cities, and the next stage will be military operations by storming the cities, and these mercenaries coming from Syria from Assad’s army and Assad’s mercenaries will perform a large part of those tasks,"" Rahal said.

He added, ""As a military observer, it is clear that the Russian army had to change its military plans. At first the Russians wanted a classic war, a war of armies, and the task assigned to the Russian army was a lightning and quick operation that President Putin called a ‘special operation’ through which the Ukrainian army would be crushed and then the leadership would collapse political in the capital Kyiv, but this did not happen.""

The brigadier general noted that, ""It is clear that the Ukrainian military leadership was a good reader of the military reality and the great difference between the capabilities of the Russian army and the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, so the Ukrainian leadership succeeded in dragging the Russian army into a war of resistance around cities, a guerrilla war, a war of ambushes, and later a street war if the Russian army stormed the Ukrainian cities.""

Rahal said his information about the forces coming to fight in Ukraine included the following units: the 4th Division, commanded by Assad’s brother; the Syrian army’s special forces; the republican guard; the 25th division; the Russian backed 5th Corps; and ""the Palestinian Al-Quds Brigade, which is fighting with the Assad army (their nationalities are Palestinian and Syrian); and the National Defense Forces militias (Syrian mercenaries who have been fighting alongside the army since the start of the Syrian revolution in 2011).""

UKRAINE WAR: DO SANCTIONS WORK? EXPERTS WEIGH IN

The Assad regime has been engulfed in war since 2011, when the Syrian dictator launched a violent crackdown on citizens seeking democracy. Russian forces intervened in 2015 to crush the revolt. The Syrian civil war has resulted in over 500,000 deaths.

Retired Col. Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, told Fox News Digital, ""It’s not clear how many Syrians or other fighters from the Middle East are likely to answer Russia’s call. They will have to be paid significant amounts to volunteer to do so. There is no doubt that among them will be Islamic State jihadists who might be looking to stay in Russia or even travel on from there to Western Europe. They are likely to be disappointed if that is their aim, unless Putin is looking to help some of them infiltrate westwards.""

Kemp noted that ""Middle Eastern fighters will be used to a completely different form of conflict than they will find in Ukraine. They are unlikely to be a match for well-armed and organized Ukrainian forces, but Putin will be happy to throw them away as cannon fodder.""

Rahal concluded with this warning: ""As a Syrian general, I refuse to push the Syrians into that war that Putin declared against the peaceful people of Ukraine. Putin wants to achieve political and personal goals at the expense of the Ukrainian people, and this is what Putin did before here in Syria.""",https://www.foxnews.com
392,Kamala Harris ripped for looking to Polish president for help on question about Ukrainian refugees,Cortney O'Brien,"

Vice President Kamala Harris was ridiculed for appearing as a deer in headlights in response to a question on how the United States could assist in the plight of Ukrainian refugees during the Russian military invasion, even appearing to look to Polish President Andrzej Duda for help.

A reporter pressed Harris on the Ukrainian refugee crisis during her joint press conference with Duda in Poland Thursday, saying that according to a colleague's reporting, Poland would not be equipped to handle an influx of Ukrainian refugees. Her colleague said that, in its current state, the refugee system in Poland will collapse because it's an improvised system that can work for ""maybe two weeks, but not indefinitely.""

""I'm wondering what the United States is going to do more specifically to set up a permanent infrastructure and, relatedly, is the United States willing to make a special allocation for Ukrainian refugees?"" the reporter asked Harris. The journalist then asked Duda if he had specifically asked the U.S. to accept more refugees.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Harris did not appear eager to answer the inquiry, turning expectantly toward Doda and saying, ""A friend in need is a friend indeed,"" before laughing for several seconds. Duda eventually capitulated and answered his question first, saying he had asked Harris to help speed the process of Ukrainian refugees obtaining U.S. visas in order to stay with family in the States.

Harris later said she understood the ""unprecedented"" situation presented to the Polish government, but did not say how many refugees the U.S. would be willing to take.

Viewers were not impressed by the vice president's response. Some said they were ""embarrassed"" by the display, while others hit her for laughing at such a somber time for the Ukrainian people. At least 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, the United Nations has estimated.

""A maternity hospital was just bombed,"" Daily Mail columnist Meghan McCain noted, referring to the Russian military's shelling of a maternity and children's hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine on Wednesday. Harris did express outrage at the bombing.

President Biden appointed Harris as his so-called border czar last year to help get a handle on the tumult there. She was slammed repeatedly for taking so long to make a trip to the border, only doing so at the near 100-day mark of her assignment. Asked by NBC's Lester Holt why it had taken months to make the trip, Harris again nervously laughed.

""And I haven't been to Europe. I mean, I don't understand the point you are making,"" Harris replied, chuckling.

The odd trend wasn't lost on observers.

CNN's Chris Cillizza was mocked Wednesday for asking if Harris' trip to Poland would be her ""moment.""

""This sort of tricky international diplomacy at a moment of crisis for Europe and the world is when (and how) leaders are made. If Harris can find a way through this fraught period with Poland, as well as the ongoing push by Ukraine for a no-fly zone, it would amount to a major win -- not just for the Biden administration, but for Harris in particular,"" Cillizza wrote.",https://www.foxnews.com
393,How miscalculations and misperceptions could lead to US-Russia conflict,Michael Lee,"

Despite President Biden's promise not to involve U.S. troops in the war between Russia and Ukraine, a miscalculation from either side during the tense struggle could risk dragging NATO into the conflict.

The fear of a deadly escalation in the conflict has been at the center of the Biden administration's response in recent days, with the Pentagon last week denying a request from Ukraine to transfer Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to the country's armed forces through the U.S.'s Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

PUTIN MAINTAINS 95% OF AVAILABLE COMBAT POWER IN UKRAINE AS WAR PERSISTS: DOD OFFICIAL WARNS

""The intelligence community has assessed that the transfer of MiG-29s may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. ""Therefore, we also assess the MiG-29s to Ukraine to be high-risk.""

But perhaps the largest risk to an escalation of the conflict would be a no-fly zone enforced by NATO, something Heritage Foundation Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy John Venable told Fox News Digital would be an unlikely risk for NATO to take.

""The complications associated with establishing a no-fly zone are enormous and would involve more risk than NATO or the US would accept under almost any circumstance,"" Venable said.

Author and former DIA intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital Thursday that a no-fly zone presents the most risk among known scenarios, but currently-unknown actions could inadvertently cause an escalation during the ""fog of war.""

""Usually the path of the escalation is difficult to predict, it can come out of nowhere in the fog of war,"" Koffler said.

Koffler argued that the current conflict in Ukraine is a ""proxy war"" between the U.S. and Russia that could easily escalate into a ""shooting war.""

""It is so easy for both sides to misinterpret each other's intentions,"" Koffler said.

She noted that Russia is already highly suspicious of the U.S. and even believes that a war between the two powers is ""inevitable.""

""The Russians are predisposed to worst-case scenario, their intelligence assessments say that a war between the U.S. and Russia is inevitable, they already believe it,"" Koffler said.

Koffler argued that any number of steps the U.S. may take in Ukraine could be interpreted by the Russians as escalatory, noting that Russian intelligence agencies rely on an algorithm with multiple inputs to assess what their adversary's next move might be. That means even small steps taken by the U.S. could be seen as a preparation for war.

Russian military doctrine would then call for the Kremlin to strike the first blow in an attempt to gain the strategic advantage, Koffler noted, adding that the Russians are aware their forces are incapable of competing with U.S. troops in a conventional conflict.

Some of Russia's paranoia about the U.S. stems from previous American military operations, Koffler said, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein.

""They have assessed that the United States is a high-risk adversary because we routinely conduct military operations to topple regimes such as Saddam,"" Koffler said.

Venable believes the best way to avoid a military conflict is to keep applying pressure on Russia to pull its forces out of Ukraine, arguing that Russia losing the war could actually cause them to escalate the situation further.

""If Putin continues to get boxed in through sanctions, trading and banking stoppages -- and he starts losing the war, that may be reason enough for him to employ tactical nuclear weapons,"" Venable told Fox News Digital. ""The West needs to continue to apply pressure, attempt to broker a settlement/cease-fire while continuing to offer off-ramps that deescalate the potential"" for a conflict between NATO and Russia.",https://www.foxnews.com
394,Russia-Ukraine: Parliament of NATO country Estonia calls for 'immediate' establishment of no-fly zone,Brooke Singman,"

The parliament of Estonia on Monday called for UN member states to ""take immediate steps to establish a no-fly zone"" over Ukraine to prevent further civilian casualties as Russia’s multi-front war against the country rages on.

Estonia is the first NATO member nation to have a body formally call for the implementation of a no-fly zone amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.

""The Riigikogu (Parliament of Estonia) expresses its support to the defenders and the people of the state of Ukraine in their fight against the Russian Federation that has launched a criminal war, and calls on showing absolute support to Ukraine in its war for maintaining its freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Estonia's parliament said in a statement Monday.

Estonia’s parliament said it ""underlines"" that Russia’s ""unprovoked aggression and military activities constitute a crime against peace with no statute of limitations, and that all war crimes that have been committed will have to be punished.""

""The Riigikogu asks the UN member states to take immediate steps to establish a no-fly zone in order to prevent massive civilian casualties in Ukraine,"" the body stated. ""The Riigikogu urges all national parliaments to adopt statements that call on their governments to support the imposition of additional sanctions against the Russian Federation as well as the Republic of Belarus that participates in the aggression.""

Estonia’s parliament also called for the ""immediate imposition of a comprehensive trade embargo on the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, which would restrict the capability of the aggressor states to wage war.""

""The Riigikogu calls on states to close their airspace and ports to the aircraft and ships of the Russian Federation,"" the body stated, calling on ""members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to vote for excluding the Russian Federation from the membership of the Council of Europe, and calls on the member states to adopt a relevant decision immediately.""

""The Riigikogu invites the member states to support Ukraine’s official application for the status of a EU candidate state and calls on granting Ukraine a roadmap to membership in NATO,"" they wrote.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pleading with the United States and western allies to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Biden and NATO have ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying that enforcing it would put the U.S. and NATO in direct confrontation with Russia and would expand the conflict.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so it is not subject to the Article V provision of the NATO alliance that says when one member country is attacked, all member countries will take action to assist.

395,Woman-led 'Dattalion' in Ukraine documents Russian invasion with citizen videos: 'Show the world the horrors',David Rutz,"

As Ukraine continues to resist Russia's invasion, citizens across the country describe themselves as more united than ever and eager to help in any way they can, including in what one Ukrainian named Lily calls the ""digital war.""

Her group, called ""Dattalion"" and led by some of Ukraine's top professional women, isn't shooting down planes but rather is fighting a different kind of battle by documenting the bloody war, day by day.

One of the Dattalion's leaders, going by ""Mariya"" instead of her real name for security purposes, told Fox News Digital the mission is simple: Tell the world the truth about what's happening in Ukraine through the power of images.

""Basically we are fighting against Russia with data, with information, and we want to show to the world about what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine, what they are doing to our kids, what they are doing to our elderly, what they are doing to our homes,"" Mariya said. ""It is a database primarily of videos but also of photos taken by civilian Ukrainians, ordinary people with their smartphones.""

UKRAINIAN JOURNALIST GROUP WORKS TO INFORM WORLD MEDIA, GET MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO RESIST RUSSIANS

The Dattalion, a combination of the words ""Data Battalion,"" was founded on Feb. 27, just three days after Russia launched its invasion, and it has thus far uploaded more than 1,000 videos and photos to its database from ordinary citizens. Updated several times per day, it's organized by day and region and provides the date and locations of the videos and images sent to them of the war, such as the maternity hospital bombed in Mariupol last week, bloodied civilians dazed from Russian shelling, and children being rescued and evacuated. The team has regional groups who work to verify footage as authentic.

Lily, who recently returned to Ukraine from Poland after driving a truck full of humanitarian supplies back across the border, said Russia was trying to ""fool all the world"" with its propaganda machine, which has blamed ""neo-Nazis"" for the violence and claimed Ukraine was responsible for a recent Russian shelling attack on Kharkiv that killed dozens of civilians.

""It is very important,"" Lily said of the Dattalion's work. ""All the information that comes from Russia, it's all fake … They are trying to fool all the world, and they've already done it with their people. That's why we want to spread truth to the world, and video and information is our weapon actually, and video and posts, marketing campaigns is our tools, so this is what we know how to do.""

Given it was formed mere days after the invasion began last month, Lily said it had quickly become a cohesive organization. It has more than 100 volunteers and is growing by the day. It has an active social media presence and encourages journalists, politicians and others around the world to access its files. Meanwhile, the Dattalion's members have coped with hacking attacks and personal threats, in addition to the immense stress of seeing their country invaded and fearing the deaths of loved ones.

STATE DEPT SAYS IT IS REVIEWING ‘VERY CREDIBLE’ REPORTS OF RUSSIAN WAR CRIMES IN UKRAINE

""We never sought this, but when we looked at our volunteers, why our volunteers are so passionate about this project because every day they are losing something, and they want to show to the world the horrors,"" Mariya said.

Lily said she often cries before editing the footage she reviews. Mariya grew emotional as she recounted the war's effect on her own family. As of Friday, the United Nation’s office of Human Rights said it has recorded 42 children dead among the 579 civilians killed, with 54 more children wounded among the 1,002 civilians injured.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE LIVE UPDATES

""I've never ever in my life imagined me or my family or anyone would go through this,"" she said. ""I could never ever imagine my kids would hear some loud sounds and would shake.""

The cataloguing effort is their way of contributing and ensuring Ukraine's crisis is crystal-clear to the rest of the globe. From data collection to input to video editing to communications, there are a variety of roles for the Dattalion's members, many of whom before the invasion held business and other leadership positions inside Ukraine.

Another member, going by ""Marina"" and currently in Austria, said she felt ""guilty"" about not being back in Ukraine, but she was gladdened by the sense of national unity in the wake of the invasion.

""You want to help your country,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""I believe that never, ever in the history of Ukraine, we never felt so united, we never felt so in love with a country … [If] you had bad relationship with a [fellow Ukrainian], it's all in the past. You're just united to do something to help.

""The only weapon that we have is our MacBook or the internet and our smartphones. This is how we fight, how we help the world to tell the truth. It's painful. It's painful to see what's going on. You cannot just stand by, and you cannot right now only think about yourself. It's the place where we want to live, and everyone is trying to bring even a small piece. What we are doing at Dattalion, it's not a small piece. It's a huge piece.""

Multiple members told Fox News Digital they wanted the U.S. and NATO allies to ""close the skies,"" the term Ukrainians use for implementing a no-fly zone over Ukraine's airspace. The U.S. has been hesitant to take that step thus far, as shooting down a Russian plane could spark a hot war ensnaring the world's nuclear powers.

‘THE VIEW’ CLASHES OVER PROPOSED UKRAINE NO-FLY ZONE: ‘WE DON’T WANT WORLD WAR III'

""We will fight to the end, but we need some help, and the best thing the world should do is close the sky,"" Mariya said. ""We will do all others. We will fight back, and we will crush them, and we will fight for our land. We just need to protect civilians.""

The Dattalion site features a counting clock for how long the war has gone on since Russia's invasion last month, but the ""digital war"" could go on past the end of the kinetic part of the conflict. Beyond continuing to keep the world informed of the conditions on the ground in some of Ukraine's bombed-out cities and towns, the database could also be a tool in the future of proving war crimes and atrocities by Russian forces, members say.

""The fact is that we've seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would, under the Geneva Conventions, constitute a war crime,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said last week.

Price’s comment came after several widely reported instances of Russian troops appearing to commit war crimes, including bombing the maternity ward, which the Kremlin has denied, and killing fleeing civilians.

As more of the footage comes in from Kyiv, Irpin, Kharkiv and elsewhere in the war-torn nation, the Dattalion will continue its difficult work.

FIRST ON FOX: Retired Marine Col. Mitchell Swan, a Republican candidate for Georgia's 10th Congressional District, released a video ad Tuesday opposing President Biden's ""woke"" focus in the military amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

""The biggest European land war since World War II, and where is our military focused: Gender dysphoria and woke training,"" Swan says in the video, first provided to Fox News Digital. ""THIS IS INSANE!""

""Putin’s reviewing nuclear options while we assess transgender therapy options,"" the retired Marine colonel adds. ""As a retired colonel who led Marines overseas, I know that this woke indoctrination will destroy our military, and that’s why I oppose transgenders in our ranks.""

He concluded the ad by pledging to ""fight woke policies on every front"" if he wins the election.

""Compulsory DOD ‘Diversity and Inclusion Training’ has become a tool of LGBTQ supporters to normalize sodomy, sinful behavior, and transgender lifestyles throughout our Armed Forces, while also waging a culture war on those traditional Christian family values many service members were raised upon,"" Swan said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. ""This tears at the moral fabric and cohesion of our military forces.""

""Furthermore, it erodes combat readiness and desecrates over 200 years of American military culture,"" he added. ""A strong military is essential to preventing escalating situations like Ukraine and Afghanistan. Allowing transgender individuals to serve sends a message to our adversaries that we are more focused on social experimentation than on the defense of our nation.""

GEORGIA GOP CANDIDATE, A RETIRED MARINE COLONEL, URGES MILITARY TO REVERSE TRANSGENDER POLICY AMID UKRAINE WAR

Swan retired as a colonel after 30 years of service in the United States Marine Corps and Marine Corps Reserve. He led Marines overseas, helped direct operations in the Pacific, and shaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, according to his campaign.

The candidate has urged the U.S. military to reverse its policy embracing transgender identity, warning that welcoming individuals with gender dysphoria into the ranks may weaken military performance and sends a message of weakness to America's adversaries in crises such as Ukraine and Afghanistan .

In previous comments to Fox News Digital, Swan noted that ""serving in the military is not a right,"" so the military holds ""strict ‘selective service’ standards.""

""In fact, many individuals with certain conditions, such as bedwetting and sleepwalking are disqualified from military service,"" he noted. ""They are not disqualified because they are bad people, but because these symptoms are considered mental and emotional issues that are not conducive to combat environments. Gender dysphoria is no different and should be treated the same; that it is not conducive to enhancing military performance or unit morale.""

BIDEN ANNOUNCES BAN ON US IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN OIL, WARNS GAS PRICES WILL 'GO UP FURTHER'

The sanctions come after the U.S. and Western allies have imposed severe and crippling sanctions on Russia, including on President Vladimir Putin.

Biden last month sanctioned major Russian banks, including VTB, Sberbank, Bank Otkritie, Sovcombank OJSC and Novikombank. The sanctions made it harder for Russia to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.

The U.S. sanctions also target Russia elites: Sergei Ivanov and his son Sergei, Andrey Patrushev and his son Nikolai, Igor Sechin and his son Ivan, Andrey Puchkov, Yuriy Solviev and two real estate companies he owns, Galina Ulyutina and Alexander Vedyakhin.

The U.S. and its partners have also said they would go after the Russian military and Belarusian individuals and entities for their support for the invasion.

Also last month, the United States, Canada and European allies announced additional sanctions that would remove ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT financial system.

SWIFT provides messaging services to banks in over 200 countries and is controlled by the central banks of the G-10, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland and Sweden.

The sanction has been used by the EU in Iran in 2012 and in 2018.

Last week, Biden moved to ban all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting the ""main artery"" of Russia’s economy.

Biden also called for an end to normal trade relations with Russia and said last week that the United States is banning the import of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds.

Revoking Russia's ""most favored nation"" status will allow for increased tariffs on imports from the country in addition to the crushing sanctions already imposed as a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it must be done by Congress. Biden highlighted bipartisan support for the move in a Friday announcement in conjunction with other G7 and European Union leader.

Russia’s economy is struggling under the weight of the sanctions, and a deep recession is predicted in the country, according to the IMF.

409,"1,510 children abused in Rotherham sex scandal, new report says",Lucia Suarez Sang,"

The child sexual abuse scandal that rocked a central city in the United Kingdom when it erupted four years ago appears to be worse than originally believed.

New figures by the National Crime Agency (NCA) put the number of children believed to have been sexually exploited in the town of Rotherham over 16-year period at an astonishing 1,510 – up from the 1,400 figure identified in a 2014 report.

At least 1,300 were female, detectives said Tuesday, the BBC reported.

A previous report commissioned by the Rotherham Council in 2014, found that at least 1,400 children – “a conservative estimate” – had been sexually exploited in the South Yorkshire city between 1997 and 2013.

According to the 2014 report, children as young as 11 were “raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated.”

Police said the victims were plied with drugs and alcohol before being abused at parties, in taxis or in back rooms. The vast majority of the victims were white British girls ages 11 to 19.

The NCA is conducting an independent investigation called Operation Stovewood at the request of the South Yorkshire Police.

In its new findings, the NCA said it has identified 110 suspects of being part of child-grooming gangs in Rotherham. About 80 percent of the suspects identified are of South Asian Muslim backgrounds, the Guardian reported.

“(Operation Stovewood is) a unique and unprecedented investigation, challenging in its scale and complexity,” said Paul Williamson, senior investigating officer with the NCA. “The momentum and pace of the inquiry is increasing and that will continue to increase. Justice is being rendered and I’ve got a very, very committed team that’s working on a very worth mission.”

The NCA said 35 individuals have been arrested, 18 have been charged and four have been convicted.

Of 1,510 potential victims, detectives said they have spoken to about 260 of them. Their aim is to speak to every victim, police said.

The South Yorkshire Police launched its own investigation – Operation Clover – in August 2013 to investigate the child sexual abuse cases. As a result, 19 men and two women have been convicted in 2016 and 2017 of sexual offenses.

One of the ringleaders, identified as Arshid Hussain, was convicted of 23 charges of rape and indecent assault. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.

Police in Rochdale, Oxford and Newcastle have also had its own child sexual abuse scandals in recent years whose crimes follow a pattern that are grimly familiar to those in Rotherham.

Some allege that the crimes were long ignored by authorities afraid they would be branded racist or fearful the allegations might inflame ethnic tensions.

413,"Oregon governor signs bill suspending math, reading proficiency requirements for HS graduates",Edmund Demarche,"

Gov. Kate Brown, the Oregon Democrat, signed a bill last month with little fanfare that drops the requirement that high school students prove proficiency in reading, writing or math before graduation, a report said.

The Oregonian reported that the governor has seemed to avoid discussing Senate Bill 744. Her move to sign the bill was ""not public until recently, because her office did not hold a signing ceremony or issue press release."" The paper also pointed out that the bill was first signed on July 14 but not added into the state’s database until July 29 due to a glitch in the system.

Brown’s office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.

In June, state lawmakers voted to approve the bill that suspended the requirements for students for three years, KATU reported. Foundations for a Better Oregon said in a statement at the time that the bill is intended to ""truly reflect what every student needs to thrive in the 21st century."" Supporters of the bill insist that considering math and reading essential skills has been an unfair challenge for students who do not test well. The report said the requirement was first suspended at the start of the pandemic.

The KATU report pointed out that Republicans have come out against the bill and claim that it lowers ""expectations for our kids."" But there was some bipartisan support.

Charles Boyle, the deputy communications director from Brown’s office, told the paper in an email that staff from the governor’s office informed legislative staffers about the bill's signing on the day it was passed. He also said that the new standards for graduation will help benefit the state’s ""Black, Latino, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian, Pacific Islander, Tribal, and students of color.""

The paper reported that the bill could stay in effect for five years until new requirements.

The paper's editorial staff urged Brown to veto the bill back in June.

""Oregon schools were among the last in the country to reopen to in-person instruction during the pandemic,"" an editorial read. ""Our legislators should be focused on how to help students regain the ground they’ve lost after a year and a half of distance learning and hybrid instruction – not on lowering our standards.""",https://www.foxnews.com

""I have a dream. These words are known to each of you,"" Zelenskyy said through a translator. ""Today I can say I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help.""

Zelenskyy first requested a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something that Democrats and Republicans have generally opposed, out of fear that it would lead to World War 3.

Any country supporting Taiwan militarily would face the ""worst consequences,"" China's government warned Saturday, adding that ""no one and no force"" would be able to stop the Communist Party if it took action against the island country, according to a report.

China’s relationship with Taiwan has come into focus against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the island bolstering its own defenses since the war started in case of aggression from the mainland.

Taiwan said it planned to double its yearly missile-production capacity this year. The announcement from the defense ministry came after Taiwan approved an extra $8.6 billion for military spending over the next five years.

Beijing doesn’t see Taiwan as a sovereign country but rather as a breakaway province that can be absorbed back into China by force if deemed necessary.

RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE PUTS TAIWAN ON HIGH ALERT OVER MAINLAND CHINA THREAT

The Communist Party’s warning came a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping held diplomatic talks with Australia, according to Sky News Australia.

China’s Ministry of National Defense accused Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton of ""ideological bias"" after he said the country would do ""whatever we can"" to keep China from attacking Taiwan, Sky News reported.

More aggressive stance

China has taken a more aggressive stance against the Democratic island nation lately, sending a record number of fighter jets into Taiwan’s air defense zone late last year.

And last month, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation.

Taiwan has been increasingly on edge since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, seeing parallels between their own situation with Beijing. After the invasion, the slogan ""Today, Ukraine, tomorrow, Taiwan!"" spread online, according to The New York Times.

According to some estimates , China spends more than $250 billion on its annual military budget, while Taiwan spends around $13 billion.

The Communist Party characteristically balked at Taiwan’s recent concerns in the wake of Moscow’s war in Ukraine, suggesting it's exaggerated rhetoric meant to make Beijing look aggressive.

‘Continue to watch’

""We continue to watch to try to identify, has [China] learned the correct lessons as it applies to the changing world order and the concern that we see in the Ukraine?"" U.S. Navy Adm. John Aquilino, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, according to the Military Times, of the unified global condemnation of Russia over the invasion and its military struggles in Ukraine.

The U.S. has supported Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders by supplying the country with weapons and slapping harsh sanctions against Russia.

But despite U.S. support, the conflict has only descended into further chaos. Russia continues to shell major cities, the civilian death toll is rising, and millions of people have fled their homes, creating the worst refugee crisis since World War II.

Geopolitics experts who spoke with Fox News said the U.S. should be devoting more resources to bolstering psychological warfare, an approach that would not send American troops into harm’s way.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Shaping perceptions

Psychological operations, or ""psyops,"" broadly refer to tactics geared toward shaping how people perceive events and information. The U.S. perfected the craft against the Soviet Union during the Cold War but has lagged behind in recent decades, preferring instead to concentrate on hard power.

Russia, meanwhile, has been perfecting the craft of peddling disinformation against Americans to deepen racial and political divisions, all while distracting Washington and emboldening U.S. adversaries.

Pysops could be a ""potential mitigating factor"" in the conflict, says Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer who grew up in the Soviet Union.

""We need to raise awareness within the Russian population about what’s going on,"" she said, ""because right now, the Russians and the Americans are limiting the information flows into Russia – the Russians because they’re afraid of Western propaganda, and the U.S. because we want to punish Russia.""

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: PARLIAMENT OF NATO COUNTRY ESTONIA CALLS FOR ‘IMMEDIATE’ ESTABLISHMENT OF NO-FLY ZONE

The net sum of these actions, she argued, has been an Iron Curtain dropped on Russia in the information domain, a situation that ultimately does not serve U.S. interests because Russians need to be favorably predisposed to Western views rather than Russian views.

Those ""Western views,"" Koffler said, include telling the truth about how Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""killing brethren Slavic people"" in Ukraine and how the Russians should not be standing for this.

Kremlin's crackdown

The Kremlin has cracked down on social media and independent outlets in Russia, effectively reshaping the narrative of its invasion of Ukraine by calling it a ""special military operation"" rather than a war.

Russia’s playbook harkens back to the Soviet-era tactic of ""reflexive control,"" whereby information is conveyed to an opponent -- causing it to react in a way that favors the initiator of the action.

The U.S. could send Russian people more information about virtual proxy networks (VPNs) to help them bypass government censorship, says Ivana Stradner, an adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has studied psyops.

The U.S. and its Western allies ought to work with disillusioned Russians who have left the country to help promote a different narrative to Russians back home, Stradner told Fox News. This not does have to entail ""the typical democracy promotion"" that has been tried by the U.S. in other parts of the world, she clarified.

LT. GEN HODGES: RUSSIANS ARE ABOUT TEN DAYS AWAY FROM ‘CULMINATING POINT’ OF EXHAUSTING AMMO, MANPOWER

Tackling corruption in Russia, for example, would resonate with more people – especially younger generations – because corruption impacts every facet of daily life, Stradner argued.

""We have to start from where we are and right now. And right now the number one thing is to offer Russians alternative views of the war and talk about corruption in the country,"" Stradner said. ""Corruption certainly affects every single young Russian over there.""

""The number one thing is to offer Russians alternative views of the war and talk about corruption in the country."" — Ivana Stradner, adviser, Foundation for Defense of Democracies

The Kremlin’s information warfare will not stop with the end of the war in Ukraine, Stradner warned. She and called for social media platforms to be more proactive in fighting disinformation.

Continue polarizing US?

""I would really not exclude also the possibility of Russia to continue polarizing American society,"" she said. ""So we might actually see new protests or different unrest prior to the 2022 elections.""

Koffler, meanwhile, said psyop tactics must be deployed diligently against Russia, lest the Kremlin overact.

She evoked the time the Soviets mistakenly shot down a South Korean airliner in 1983 at a time when the U.S. was running major psyop campaigns against the Kremlin.

""The other side of (psyops) is that you can unintentionally cause your adversary to overreact. So, it’s the kind of thing that you have to be super accurate. And that requires a deep understanding of your adversary,"" she said.

426,Survivors and victims on shocking state-sanctioned organ harvesting in China,Hollie Mckay,"

Having hepatitis C may very well have saved Jennifer Zeng’s life.

In February 2000, she was arrested for being a Falun Gong practitioner and interrogated intensely about her medical history at a Labor Camp in China’s Da Xing County, she said. Zeng’s blood was drawn and she told them she had hepatitis C before she took up the spiritual practice.

“Twelve days later, my (cellmate) died as a result of forced feeding,” Zeng told Fox News. “Having hepatitis C might have unqualified me as an organ donor.”

It’s the stuff of nightmares. And it has been buried from public view, hard to prove, and shrouded beneath the cloak of silence for almost two decades.

But anecdotes and evidence are slowly bubbling to the surface that the organs of members of marginalized groups detained in Chinese prisons and labor camps are unwillingly harvested. Most affected is a spiritual minority, the Falun Gong, who have been persecuted for adhering to a Buddhist-centric religious philosophy grounded in meditation and compassion.

After 12 months of independent assessment of all available evidence, the seven-person China Tribunal panel – which was initiated by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), an international human rights charity – delivered its final findings in June. The tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC who led the prosecution of Slobodan Milosevic in the International Criminal Trial for the former Yugoslavia, stated with “certainty” that “in China, forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time.”

“Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years, and Falun Gong practitioners have been one – and probably the main – source of organ supply,” the report concluded, pointing to the growing transplant industry already worth more than $1 billion.

WHAT CHINESE SPIES WANT FROM AMERICANS

The report underscored that there were “extraordinarily short waiting times for organs to be available for transplantation,” and numerous websites advertised hearts, lungs, and kidneys for sale – suggesting an on-demand industry. The Tribunal concluded that the commission of Crimes Against Humanity against Falun Gong and Uighurs had been committed.

Witness testimonies provided to the tribunal, and interviewed by Fox News, paint the picture of an unfathomably callous trade often performed when the victims are still alive.

Han Yu was kidnapped on July 20, 2015, and detained for 37 days in Beijing’s Haidian District Detention Center.

In May 2004 – three months after her father disappeared into a detention center – Han Yu received a call that her father, a Falun Gong practitioner, was dead. But it wasn’t until almost a month later that the family was allowed to view the body at Liangxiang District Xiao Zhuang village morgue, with dozens of authorities surveilling their every move.

“I saw obvious injuries on his face, even after the makeup, the severe bruise below his left eye stood out. There was a trace of stitches starting from the throat down to where his clothes covered,” Yu recalled. “I tried to unbutton the clothes, the police saw and quickly dragged me out. Later another family member went in and continued to unbutton and found stitches that went all the way to the stomach.”

She suspects her father was a victim of organ harvesting. The family was not given an autopsy, Hu stressed, and the body was hurriedly cremated.

“We were not even allowed to cry when he was buried,” Hu continued, reflecting on the throngs of authorities that trailed their every move and prohibited any photographs from being taken. “After I heard about organ harvesting, I couldn’t imagine what had happened to my father before his death. It happened, and it is happening.”

Jiang Li also believes her father, Jiang Xiqing – also of the Falun Gong faith – was a victim to the harrowing practice. He was arrested on May 2008 and sent to a forced labor camp. On the afternoon of January 27, 2009, she and three other family members went to visit him.

“His mental and physical health was normal. Then at 3.40 p.m. the next day, the labor camp called my brother and said he had died and immediately hung up,” she said. “Seven of my family members arrived at the mortuary house at 10.30 p.m. with the guidance of police officers. They read out the regulations – we could see the body for only five minutes, no cameras or communication devices, and we could only go to the freezer room to see Jiang’s head and not his whole body.”

But when her older sister touched his face, she screamed that his philtrum was still warm, and his upper teeth were biting his lower lip. He was alive.

“We pulled out my father’s body halfway. We touched his chest, and it was warm. He was wearing a down jacket. My older sister prepared to perform CPR,” Li continued. “But were each forcibly dragged out of the freezer by four people. Uniformed and plainclothes officers pushed my father’s body into the freezer. They demanded that we quickly sign for cremation and pay the fees.”

The family has since attempted to seek some sense of justice – their lawyers ended up behind bars, and their family home was raided. In 2010, Li said she was terminated from her job without explanation and detained.

Survivors routinely point to the frequent physical screenings, ultrasounds, and X-rays as further corroboration that victims are being monitored to determine whose organs are healthy enough for transplantation purposes, as most are pushed to the brink in allegedly tortuous interrogation sessions.

Moreover, the China Organ Harvest Research Center (COHRC), which also testified before the China Tribunal, published its own incriminating report in July after years of underground research and analysis, deducing that the “on-demand killing of prisoners of conscience is driven by the state, run on an industrial scale and carried out by both military and civilian institutions.”

China boasts that it sustains the largest voluntary organ donation system in Asia, but experts contend that the country does not have a history of willful organ donation and the official figures – 10,000 transplants each year – “understates the real volume,” which researchers pledge is likely upward of 60,000-100,000 annually.

According to the COHRC, there are mountains of money to be made. Data from 2007 shows that hospitals charged more than $65,000 for a kidney transplant, $130,000 for liver, and more than $150,000 for lung or heart. Desperate patients might make a high-price “donation” for a new organ at top-speed.

The practice is alleged to have started in the 90s on a small-scale, but kicked into high gear around 2000 and focused on the Falun Gong. It was initially characterized as targeting the forcible removing of organs of prisoners on death row.

“China later claimed that death row prisoners consented to donate their organs to the State to redeem themselves for the crimes they had committed against the State, a practice China claimed to have stopped in January 2015. However, the explosion of organ transplant activities in China from 2000, together with reports of thousands of transplant tourists going to China to purchase organs, suggests a larger supply of organs than could be sourced from executed criminals alone,” the Tribunal states. “The scale of the Chinese transplant industry, together with other evidence, points to the possibility that China is involved in forced organ harvesting and selling for profit organs from prisoners of conscience.”

The Tribunal affirmed that it “has had no evidence that the significant infrastructure associated with China’s transplantation industry has been dismantled and absent a satisfactory explanation as to the source of readily available organs concludes that forced organ harvesting continues till today.”

Grace Yin, a leading researcher at the COHRC, also asserted that by admitting to less severe abuse and proclaiming it was only happening to those awaiting capital punishment, the government was purporting to “divert attention away from the more severe issue.”

“The root issue still goes back to the Communist Party’s persecution of faith groups and its animosity toward groups that it perceives as threats to its ideological control,” she said.

Olivia Enos, a senior policy analyst and Asian studies expert at The Heritage Foundation, concurred that organ harvesting has long been a largely overlooked aspect of human rights abuses and has been predominantly reported by the Falun Gong.

“In recent months, however, as the crisis in Xinjiang gathered steam, new reports have emerged that Uighurs may be having their organs harvested,” she observed.

US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT

Xinjiang, also referred to by some as East Turkistan, has made headlines with the revelations that upwards on one million belonging to the Muslim minority have been carted off into concentration camps. Chinese leaders have categorically denied misconduct, insisting that Uighurs are in “re-education camps” and doubled-down that the government respects religious rights. Four Uighurs testified before the China Tribunal that they had been organ scanned whilst in detention.

Salih Hudayar, ambassador to the U.S. for the East Turkistan Government in Exile and a leader in the beleaguered Uighur community, told Fox News that the Chinese government claims that “written consent is required for all organ transplants,” but in reality it is hardly likely there was any such consent, and if there was it would have been “extracted through torture.”

“Voice prints and retina scans were collected in 2016-2017 in East Turkistan, and some of us fear that they might be used for organ matching,” Hudayar continued. “We fear that today, the Chinese Communist Party may be harvesting the organs of not just Falun Gong practitioners, but also Uighurs, Tibetan Buddhists, Chinese Christians and other prisoners of conscience.”

But some political leaders are pushing for the U.S. to take a stronger stance in investigating the horrific allegation.

“It is just so bizarre it was hard to believe. That (governments) can defile a human being like that,” Shawn Steel, California’s Republican National (RNC) Committeeman, told Fox News. “Medical tourism is big business; if you are wealthy, you can get the organ you need in a couple of weeks. Thousands are being sacrificed every year, and it is not being discussed.”

Earlier this year, Steel introduced a resolution to the RNC condemning Beijing’s practice of involuntary organ harvesting from inmates, which was unanimously adopted at the quarterly conference in August. It marked the first explicit charge from a prominent U.S political party on the matter.

Representatives for the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment, but the government has previously denied any accusations of illicit organ harvesting or mistreatment of prisoners.

And many assert the practice is still happening.

Yu Ming, 47, another member of Falun Gong and newly arrived in the United States, claimed that he was “kidnapped” multiple times by law enforcement, the most recent time in August 2013, and locked up in the Shenyang Detention Center where he was allegedly beaten into oblivion.

As time when on, his friends disappeared. The family of one Falun Gong companion, Gao Yixi, recalled seeing “his eyes opened wide, his stomach deflated and no organs inside.”

He secretly recorded footage of undercover interviews at major military hospitals in mainland China over the past couple of years, he said, and has turned it over to the Tribunal as evidence for unlawful organ transplants.

President Biden will talk by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday at 9 a.m. ET.

The pair will address the Russia-Ukraine war, competition between China and the U.S. and other topics, the White House said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the call is part on the Biden administration's ""ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication"" between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

CHINA CLAIMS IT'S ‘IMPARTIAL’ ON UKRAINE CONFLICT, DISMISSED ‘DISINFORMATION’ ABOUT SENDING RUSSIANS AID

China has yet to condemn the invasion, though an official praised the Ukrainian people on Wednesday.

""We will always respect your state, we will develop relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We will respect the path chosen by Ukrainians , because this is the sovereign right of every nation,"" China's ambassador to Ukraine, Fan Xiangong, who relocated with the Chinese embassy from Kyiv to Lviv after Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, told Lviv officials on Monday, according to the Lviv regional government .

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""In this situation, which you have now, we will act responsibly. We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength,"" Fan added.

German news outlet BILD reported that Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov was halfway to Beijing Wednesday night when his plane turned around abruptly and returned to Moscow. It’s unclear if Putin called him back or if Chinese abruptly canceled any planned meeting. Fox News has not yet independently verified the report.

Friday's call will be the fourth engagement between the U.S. and Chinese presidents since Biden took office.

Biden and Xi last spoke during a virtual meeting on Nov. 15. Senior administration officials told Fox News did not explicitly discuss the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic Xi, but instead maintained the importance of ""transparency"" in global health matters, focusing on ""broader health security issues"" in an effort to bring ""an end"" to the pandemic.

U.S. officials have claimed that Russia has sought military and economic aid from China. The Kremlin has denied reports claiming they made the request, and China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian dismissed allegations China agreed to send such aid to Russia as ""misinformation."" He maintained that China remains ""completely objective, impartial and constructive,"" on the ""Ukraine issue,"" refusing to call the conflict a ""war.""

Zhao has also repeated the Russian line about U.S.-backed Ukrainian laboratories near the border creating bioweapons – claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department have all unequivocally denied. Zelenskyy delivered an address to Congress Wednesday during which he showed a video demonstrating the death and destruction suffered by Ukrainian civilians, especially women, children and the elderly as Russian troops have bombarded cities and advanced toward the capital of Kyiv in the three weeks since the invasion began.

In response, Biden announced an additional $800 million in military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, amounting to a total of $1 billion in U.S. aid allocated since Saturday.

The new package includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; 2,000 Javelins, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; 100 unmanned drones; 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns; more than 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds; 25,000 sets of body armor; and 25,000 helmets. The equipment will be transferred directly from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military, Biden said.

Speaking at his daily press conference Thursday, Zhao said China has sent humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, blaming the United States, instead of Russian President Vladimir Putin, for bloodshed happening in Ukraine.

Confronted directly over Ukrainian civilian casualties, Zhao deflected, asking: ""I wonder if you were equally concerned about the people in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Palestine?""

He said the true ""culprits of the crisis"" in Ukraine were the U.S. and NATO.

""It is those countries that delude themselves into thinking that they can lord it over the world after winning the Cold War, those that keep driving NATO’s eastward expansion five times in disregard of other countries’ security concerns, and those that wage wars across the globe while accusing other countries of being belligerent, that should really feel ‘uncomfortable’,"" he told reporters Thursday.

""The key to solving the Ukraine crisis is in the hands of the US and NATO,"" Zhao said. ""We hope the US and NATO, the culprits of the crisis, can reflect upon their roles in the Ukraine crisis.""

437,"Florida man accused of killing girlfriend's mother on her 93rd birthday, authorities say",David Aaro,"

A Florida man is accused of killing his girlfriend's mother at a retirement facility Sunday on her 93rd birthday, according to authorities.

""This is a tragic and heinous case, and our thoughts are with her family and her loved ones,"" Orange County Sheriff John Mina said during a Thursday news conference.

Javier Rosado Martínez, 54, was arrested Wednesday on a first-degree murder charge in the death of Dolores Padilla Marrero, whose body was found Monday at St. Joseph Garden Courts, a retirement community about 10 miles east of downtown Orlando.

MARYLAND POLICE CHARGE SUSPECT IN 1989 HOMICIDE COLD CASE

Family members described Padilla Marrero as a devout Catholic who was always willing to help others, Mina said. She leaves behind four children, 11 grandchildren, and 21 great-grandchildren.

""Sunday was Dolores's 93rd birthday, and unfortunately late that evening she was brutally murdered by someone she knew, someone she had gone out of her way to help,"" Mina added. ""And that person was 54-year-old Javier Rosado Martínez.""

On Sunday, a resident at the retirement community noticed a man, later identified as Martínez, attempting to gain access to the facility via a keypad. The resident said they let the man in and later that night, a neighbor heard a male voice asking to be allowed inside the victim's residence, an arrest warrant stated, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Martínez had arrived at the facility after getting into a fight with his on-again, off-again girlfriend who thought he was on drugs at the time, said Homicide Sgt. Joe Covelli during the news conference.

Family members said they dropped Padilla Marrero off at the facility at 8 p.m., on Sunday and did a well-being check Monday after she failed to answer her phone.

When they entered the residence, they found the victim laying naked on the bed with her torso covered by a blanket and her face covered with a pillow, authorities said.

A medical examiner determined that the cause of death was strangulation and blunt force trauma to her torso, Covelli said. He noted the blunt force trauma was cracked ribs.

During an investigation, authorities said a horn necklace that Martínez usually wears was found wrapped in a shirt next to Padilla Marrero's dead body.

Martínez was later apprehended at a residence in Casselberry, Florida, where authorities said they found items linking him to homicide, including the necklace and keys to the victim's residence.

While Martínez did not confess to killing Padilla Marrero, he told authorities he was on drugs and ""blacked out"" during the incident, Covelli said.

Martínez and his girlfriend lived at the retirement facility with Padilla Marrero until January when Martinez had an argument with another resident, the Orlando Sentinel reported. After the argument, the resident wrote a letter to Padilla Marrero warning that Martinez couldn't stay there anymore, Covelli added.

Covelli noted that Padilla Marrero would typically offer her children a place to stay for a week or two.

Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared at a massive rally in Moscow Friday, applauding his troops as they continued pounding Ukrainian cities with shelling and missiles.

""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans,"" Putin, wearing a white turtleneck and a blue jacket, told the crowd gathered in and around Luzhniki Stadium. Approximately 200,000 people were in attendance, many waiving Russian flags, according to Russian police and state-run media. Many reports estimated that the crowd was significantly smaller, noting that the stadium holds a maximum of 81,000 people.

Putin praised his soldiers at the celebration to mark the eighth anniversary of Russia's seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. ""Shoulder to shoulder, they help each other, support each other and when needed they shield each other from bullets with their bodies like brothers. Such unity we have not had for a long time,"" he said during the five-minute speech.

BIDEN CALLS PUTIN A 'WAR CRIMINAL' AFTER SAYING RUSSIA IS INFLICTING 'APPALLING DEVASTATION' ON UKRAINE

He called the Feb. 24 invasion necessary to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine – a claim flatly rejected by the West.

State television, which featured his speech, briefly cut out due to a technical glitch, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Putin quoted Russia's 18th-century naval commander, Fyodor Ushakov, to indicate that Russia would prevail in Ukraine. ""He once said that these thunderstorms will go to the glory of Russia,"" the president said. ""That is the way it was then, that is the way it is now and it will always be that way.""

The event was held inside a soccer stadium that was used in the 2018 Soccer World Cup. The slogan ""For a world without Nazism"" appeared on the stage where Putin spoke.

Before the autocratic leader addressed the crowd, speakers praised him for fighting ""Nazism"" in Ukraine – an assertion rejected as false by many world leaders. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish. Zelenskyy has noted previously that members of his family were killed in the Holocaust.

440,NH pastor charged with child pornography possession after 5-year investigation,Audrey Conklin,"

A New Hampshire pastor has been charged with multiple counts of possessing child pornography after a five-year investigation, according to court documents.

Nashua police arrested Stephen Bates, 46, on March 15. The Bible Baptist Church pastor is now facing five counts of possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and is being held on $3,000 cash bail.

""I think this case is particularly concerning because he is a pastor and somebody that’s involved in the community here,"" Nashua Police Lt. Brian Trefry told WHDH.

The Nashua Police Department has been investigating Bates since 2016, when the department received 14 tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children alleging that a user at the church had uploaded CSAM from an IP address leading back to the church.

DISNEY EMPLOYEES AMONG 108 ARRESTED IN FLORIDA HUMAN TRAFFICKING STING: POLICE

In October 2017, detectives spoke directly to Bates and asked if he knew of any potential suspects. Bates allegedly told authorities that he did not know of any suspects and said the church's doors are typically unlocked.

""Pastor Bates was considered a person of interest during the earlier investigations but until [March 15] there wasn’t sufficient evidence to charge him with any crimes,"" a press release from the police department states.

In January 2019, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) of Manchester, New Hampshire, received a referral from HSI Colorado, which was conducting an online child sexual exploitation investigation. Online accounts on Instagram and The Onion Router (Tor) pointed back to the Bible Baptist Church's main office.

Between 2019 and 2021, Nashua Police continued to receive tips pointing back to the Bible Baptist Church office. Police authorized a federal search warrant and investigated electronic devices at the church, including Bates' personal phone, but found nothing of significance. Bates continued to tell investigators that he never consumed child pornography.

Finally, in 2021, a detective began an undercover conversation with a user who was using an account name similar to those police had received in earlier tips. Eventually, one conversation ""included the sexual exploitation of children."" In February 2022, police linked the accounts — which were involved in the possession, distribution and manufacturing of CSAM — to Bates.

On March 15, police executed a search warrant and contacted Bates, who gave police two flash drives from his back pocket. The USBs showed various child sex abuse images, according to the affidavit.

A U.S. Marine Corps aircraft carrying four occupants crashed in northern Norway during a NATO exercise Friday evening, according to officials.

None of the occupants survived, Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store confirmed Saturday.

""The soldiers participated in the NATO exercise Cold Response,"" Store said in a statement. ""Our deepest sympathies go to the soldiers’ families, relatives and fellow soldiers in their unit.""

The exercises in Norway were part of those held annually and were unrelated to the war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.

The cause of the crash remained under investigation, the report said.

NATO SAYS 'WE COULD HAVE DONE EVEN MORE' IN LEAD-UP TO RUSSIAN INVASION, BUT REJECTS NO-FLY-ZONE PLEAS

The Marines earlier had said only that an ""incident"" occurred in northern Norway, and that the aircraft was a V-22B Osprey that was part of NATO Exercise Cold Response 22.

The aircraft belonged to the U.S. military, Norway's armed forces told the AP.

The incident remained under investigation, the Marines said in a Twitter message.

In a statement provided to Fox News, a spokesperson for the II Marine Expeditionary Force said it was aware of what it described as a ""mishap"" involving an aircraft in Norway.

The Osprey was on its way to Bodo, where it was scheduled to land about 6 p.m. Friday, but it crashed in Gratadalen in Beiarn, located south of Bodo, the AP reported.

‘Grateful for their efforts’

Norwegian authorities launched a search and rescue effort, the spokesperson added.

""We are grateful for their efforts and will assist them in the search and rescue in all manners possible,"" the spokesperson said.

Police arriving at the crash site about 1:30 a.m. Saturday confirmed that the crew of four had died, according to the AP.

The women’s advocacy group has been outside Georgia Tech’s athletic center protesting transgender swimmer Lia Thomas competing in the NCAA women’s swimming and diving championships since Wednesday.

She went on to say Biden’s executive order to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender identity was ""a slap in the face"" and ""from that moment I really haven't known how to categorize myself politically.""

Another member of Save Women’s Sports said, ""I always voted as a liberal, from 18 to 39. I registered Republican in 2020 after two politicians told me they did not want my vote because of my stance on the rights for women and girls.""

The New York Times on Wednesday subtly confirmed the Hunter Biden laptop story that was largely written off by mainstream news outlets as disinformation when the New York Post first reported it ahead of the 2020 presidential election and media watchdogs want to see the organizations that initially dismissed it correct their reporting and analysis.

""Outlets who actively tried to cover up the original New York Post laptop story absolutely need to correct the record,"" journalist Drew Holden told Fox News Digital.

""These weren't simple misgivings -- they smeared the accurate, significant scoops of a competitor as disinformation, and they absolutely have an obligation to correct the record,"" Holden said.

NEW YORK TIMES SCOLDED FOR HANDLING OF HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY

The Post reported the laptop’s contents included emails, text messages, photos and financial documents between himself, his family and business associates that showed how he used his political influence in his foreign business dealings, specifically in his work as a board member of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. However, voters who relied on the mainstream press for information ahead of the presidential election were told not to believe the report.

Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent quickly declared the day after the Post first began reporting on the laptop that it was ""Trump's fake new Biden scandal,"" calling the allegations ""laughably weak.""

NPR public editor Kelly McBride addressed a listener's question about the news outlet's blackout of the Hunter Biden story at the time. After claiming the Post's reporting had ""many, many red flags,"" including its potential ties to Russia, NPR determined the ""assertions don’t amount to much.""

""We don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don't want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions,"" NPR managing editor Terence Samuel told McBride.

""Obviously, we're not going with the New York Post story right now on Hunter Biden,"" CNN political director David Chalian said during a conference call on Oct. 14, the same day the Post published its first story on Hunter Biden's emails.

MSNBC anchor Katy Tur mocked the Post's story, saying it ""dropped like a bomb,"" but to ""wither under scrutiny, not really dropping like a bomb,"" while MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle attacked those who were covering the Hunter Biden controversy, referring to it as a ""so-called story"" with ""unverified claims.""

These are just a small sample of the corporate media’s overwhelming attempt to silence the story, which was even censored on Twitter.

NPR, CNN, MSNBC and the Washington Post did not respond to requests for comment.

GLENN GREENWALD BLASTS THE NEW YORK TIMES OVER HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP ADMISSION

DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall isn’t surprised that many outlets have failed to correct their reporting, as ""news organizations are historically hesitant to acknowledge mistakes,"" but he thinks they need to be more transparent going forward.

""That includes admitting errors of fact and errors in decision-making. News credibility is in deep decline and that is partly because news organizations can't bring themselves to honestly explain to the public when they have made mistakes. Further, when mistakes are acknowledged, they should get sufficient space and placement that readers can actually see them,"" McCall told Fox News Digital.

""The Hunter Biden laptop story is important on several levels. First, the story was ignored by most establishment media when it first broke, and what little coverage it received was largely to dismiss or debunk the scoop of the New York Post. The journalism of omission in this case was totally glaring in that the establishment media were clearly trying to protect the Biden family as the 2020 election was winding down,"" McCall added. ""The lack of curiosity by most media outlets was puzzling, to say the least.""

FLASHBACK: BIDEN OFFICIALS PUSHED ANGLE THAT HUNTER LAPTOP WAS ‘RUSSIAN DISINFO’

NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck doesn’t feel that simply correcting stories is enough at this point.

""Not only do they need to correct their stories, but they need to fess up to their blatant disinformation campaign to not only censor those who shared the truth, but their adolescent temper tantrums about how it was Russian disinformation to suggest the First Son's laptop and contents were legitimate or, at a minimum, explore in full,"" Houck told Fox News Digital.

""Aside from their general perpetuation of a false narrative about Team Trump and Russia, this was the biggest single media scandal of the decade and there needs to be accountability, both on the ethics side and people losing their jobs,"" he added.

British moms and dads were fuming after a school instructed students to write an essay explaining why they had converted to Islam.

Gemma Gough posted the assignment on Facebook – and said her child would not be completing the assignment.

Click here to listen to Todd’s podcast on “The Rise of Islam in American Public Schools”.

“This is not acceptable,” she wrote. ‘Kids are too impressionable and imagine if these letters got in the wrong hands in years to come.”

The 12 and 13-year-old kids at Beaucamps High School in Guernsey were told to consider what it would be like to become a Muslim. They also had to write a letter to their loved ones explaining their decision to become a Muslim.

Can you imagine when the students returned home?

“Mummy, Mummy! I converted to Islam! Cheerio!”

The controversial lesson was part of a creative writing exercise as part of a religious education lesson, The Daily Mail reports. The school pointed out that it was a make-believe scenario – and no child was actually forced to convert to the Islamic faith.

Local residents were not convinced.

“In this day and age when easily-led youngsters are being radicalized, it is a dangerous road to be taking,” wrote one observer on the Guernsey Press website.

“Teach pupils about religion by all means but be very careful when you ask them to be Muslim,” another wrote.

The school said they plan to expose the students to other religions – like Christianity and Judaism. But let’s be honest – do you really think they’re going to have the kids write about how Jesus Christ changed their lives?

Thomas, who set a program record with her victory in 500 free on Thursday, finished dead last with a time of 48.18, despite entering the finals with the fourth-fastest time.

Thomas’s loss comes amid a national debate over the NCAA’s transgender policy.

The NCAA updated its policy in January to defer to the guidance of each sport’s governing body. The NCAA announced that its policy would become effective in March, starting with the Division I women’s swimming and diving championships.

USA Swimming updated its policy shortly after requiring transgender athletes who are competing at an elite level to have small levels of testosterone — half of what Thomas was allowed to compete with — for at least 36 months before being eligible. But the NCAA said weeks later that the administrative subcommittee of the Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports (CMAS) decided it wouldn’t alter its testosterone guidance.

450,More Republicans than Democrats would stay and fight if what happened in Ukraine occurred in US: poll,David Aaro Is A Reporter At Fox News Digital,"If Americans were in the same position as Ukrainians right now, more Republicans than Democrats would stay and fight, according to a poll released Monday.

Of the Republicans surveyed in the Quinnipiac University Poll, 68% said they would stay and fight compared to 40% of Democrats. Among Democrats, 52% said they would flee the country, compared to 25% of Republicans.

While the hypothetical question was polarizing between parties, the majority of Americans (55%) would still stay and fight if they were in the same position as the Ukrainians are now. Only 38% of those surveyed said they would leave the country.

UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES

""When confronted with a terrible hypothetical that would put them in the shoes of the Ukrainians, Americans say they would stand and fight rather than seek safety in another country,"" said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy.

According to the poll, 66% of Republicans and 91% of Democrats said they supported accepting Ukrainian refugees into the U.S.

At least 1.7 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian offensive nearly two weeks ago, according to data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.

According to the poll, 60% of Americans also believe Russian President Vladimir Putin is mentally unstable and willing to use nuclear weapons against NATO countries.

When asked if Putin's actions against Ukraine were comparable to Adolph Hitler's actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia before the outbreak of World War II, half of Americans surveyed agreed.

If Putin decides to go beyond Ukraine and attack a NATO country, 79% approved a U.S. military response, including 82% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats.

END UKRAINE SLAUGHTER AND STAND UP TO RUSSIA, AMERICANS TELL BIDEN IN NEW POLL

""Russians are largely in the dark about and unable to halt the destruction being wrought by Putin, say Americans who see the Russian leader as mentally unstable. And half of Americans liken Putin to modern history's darkest villain, Adolf Hitler,"" added Malloy.

Nearly half of Americans (49%) also say the attack on Ukraine has contributed to them feeling anxious, according to the poll.

When asked how long they expect the war in Ukraine to last, 19% of those surveyed believe it will be over in weeks, 44% feel it will end in months, and 23% believe it will last years.

As millions of vaccines go in arms across the county, federal employees who refuse citing a religious exemption are quietly being entered into an online database.

Fox News looked through the records, and the Departments of Justice, Interior, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development and Transportation are just a few agencies taking part in the collection.

""It's not surprising that the government is keeping a record of religious exemptions. The government does have to track its workforce,"" George Washington University Law professor Jonathan Turley said.

For example, the Department of Transportation database ""includes requests for a medical or religious accommodation to decline the Covid-19 vaccination.""

""Religious exemptions are based on the most personal and profound parts of people's lives. They invoke these exemptions because they feel they cannot take this vaccine,"" Turley added.

Religious rights groups are calling foul about the databases.

""This is concerning because of the type of data that's being gathered,"" Ryan Bangert with Alliance Defending Freedom told Fox News.

Some of the databases also collect the vaccination status of all federal employees, not only those who said no for a religious reason. In September, President Biden ordered all federal employees to get vaccinated.

""This is not about freedom or personal choice. It's about protecting yourself and those around you, the people you work with,"" Biden said in September.

Liberal mega-donor George Soros has directed $1 million to an activist group attempting to defund the police as violent crime surges in major urban centers across the nation.

Soros sent the million dollars via his Color Of Change PAC on May 14, according to Federal Election Commission files obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

SOROS QUIETLY DROPS $200,000 BACKING ANOTHER FAR-LEFT PROSECUTOR IN VIRGINIA

The organization describes itself as ""the nation’s largest online racial justice organization"" and actively engages in efforts to defund police departments such as spreading an online petition calling for ""divesting from and dismantling the systems that unjustly harm Black people.""

The group also backed a push by the Milwaukee City Council to defund the police.

""Policing is a violent institution that must end,"" the group’s president wrote in a statement supporting the move. ""We imagine a country where there is enough money to educate our children, care for our sick and feed those who are financially unstable. Defunding the police allows for this vision.""

Violent crime has surged dramatically in many large cities across the United States this year, including in areas where Soros has spent large sums of money electing Democratic candidates who have promised to ease sentencing requirements and implement relaxed bail reform laws.

In 2018, Soros spent millions of dollars to help elect current Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon who promised to implement sentencing reforms and decriminalize certain illegal activities. In 2021, the Los Angeles City Council redirected funds from the LAPD to social outreach organizations.

This year in Los Angeles, murders are up 20% and violent crime has spiked which has contributed to a rampant homeless crisis that many argue Gascon’s policies have made worse .

Proposition A, an Austin ballot proposal for the Nov. 2 election backed by the group Save Austin Now, would require at least two Austin police officers for every 1,000 residents and would provide officers with an additional 40 hours of police training each year on topics such as weapons proficiency and active shooter scenarios.

Jenna Jameson is giving a new update on her mystery illness.

The former adult film star took to her Instagram Story on Monday and clarified that she’s not ""paralyzed"" and is ""able to move her legs"" after she was hospitalized.

""I am just dealing with extreme muscle weakness,"" the 47-year-old wrote. ""Some issues with my left nerve.""

Jameson added that she’s ""slowly"" getting stronger.

""I am walking around – with a walker,"" Jameson explained. ""My legs have lost a lot of muscle so I am busy trying to build it back. This has been not only physically taxing, but I think, more than that, just really mentally challenging. Very mentally challenging.""

Jameson revealed that her diagnosis remains unclear. However, the issue seems to stem from her left femoral nerve, which runs from the hip down to above the knee. It also controls the surrounding muscles.

Despite the ""messy"" health setback, Jameson insisted she was not giving up on her recovery.

""I am fighting, I am kicking a--, I am taking names and soon I will be back up on my feet unaided, and life will be back to normal,"" she said. ""I mean, as normal as I can be.""

Earlier this year, Jameson was hospitalized for nearly two months. Jameson was first diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome and took to Instagram to share her diagnosis. However, not long after, her partner, Lior Bitton, posted an update on the star's Instagram page, revealing that she does not have the autoimmune condition after additional tests were run.

""Just a little update, Jenna is still in the hospital,"" he shared in mid-January. ""She doesn't have Guillain-Barré syndrome. It was confirmed by the doctor after a second test and five rounds of IVig, so she does not have Guillain-Barré.""

IVig — short for intravenous immune globulin — is a treatment for patients with antibody deficiencies.

Earlier in Jameson's hospitalization, Bitton revealed that Jameson underwent CT and MRI scans, as well as a spinal tap test.

""She's not feeling so good. She was actually throwing up for a couple of weeks, and we had to take her to the hospital,"" he recalled at the time, adding that she was released after a CT scan came back with ""so-so"" results.

""She came back home, and she couldn't carry herself. Her muscles in her legs were very weak,"" Bitton continued. ""She wasn't able to walk to the bathroom. She was falling on the way back or to the bathroom and I would have to pick her up and put her in bed.""

Within two days, Jameson was unable to walk, her partner said, even with a walker. Bitton then took her back to the hospital, where they began to run tests.

Jameson and Bitton share a 4-year-old daughter named Batel Lu. She also shares 13-year-old twin boys, Journey and Jesse, with ex Tito Ortiz.

Last month, Cadesha Bishop, 28, pleaded guilty to abuse of an older vulnerable person resulting in substantial bodily harm or death. She had originally been charged with murder, FOX 5 of Las Vegas reported.

""I’m sorry for my behavior,"" Bishop told the judge Friday while complaining about her portrayal in the media.

Before she pushed him, Fournier had reportedly asked Bishop to be ""nice to the passengers."" Witnesses said she had been swearing and yelling at other riders, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

She pushed him with both hands ""with enough force that he never touched any of the steps,"" an arrest report said, according to FOX 5. He died a month later.

""With all due respect, I would like to address something that is a problem in our sport right now and hurting athletes, especially female swimmers,"" the letter read. ""Everyone has heard and known about transgender swimmer, Lia Thomas, and her case including all the issues and concerns that her situation brought into our sport. I’d like to point out that I respect and fully stand with Lia Thomas; I am convinced that she is no different than me or any other D1 swimmer who has woken up at 5am her entire life for morning practice. She has sacrificed family vacations and holidays for a competition. She has pushed herself to the limit to be the best athlete she could be. She is doing what she is passionate about and deserves that right. On the other hand, I would like to critique the NCAA rules that allow her to compete against us, who are biologically women.

""I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future. It doesn’t promote our sport in a good way and I think it is disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.""

Thomas’ dominance in the pool had been a point of contention all season long. She received the all-clear to compete in the Ivy League and NCAA Championships in the days leading up to the events.

471,Washington Post reporter defends Judge Jackson's inability to define what a ‘woman’ is: it’s ‘complicated’,Kristine Parks,"

Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, drew criticism for denying knowing how to define the word, ""woman,"" during Tuesday's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. However, a liberal reporter from the Washington Post defended Jackson’s stunning answer, by claiming the definition was actually, ""complicated.""

National correspondent Philip Bump, slammed Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for asking the question and called it a ""bad faith"" ""attack"" in his analysis, Wednesday.

The liberal journalist compared identifying gender to identifying a color.

""[E]ven things like colors involve simply introducing more and more refined demonstrations of the category. As philosophers will tell us, language is necessarily imprecise, but it’s our only way of describing the world. So I ask you, in that context: What is a woman?"" he wrote.

Keeping up with the color analogy, Bump claimed the definition of ""red,"" like ""woman,"" sounds simple but can be complicated.

""'Red' is the absorption of a certain wavelength of light. It is also the color of hearts on Valentine’s Day. What definition do you want?"" he asked.

OUTRAGE AFTER KETANJI BROWN JACKSON SAYS SHE ‘CAN’T’ DEFINE THE WORD WOMAN: ‘LEGIT BIZARRE’

Bump also attacked Blackburn for quoting the judge's praise for the ""progressive education"" at Georgetown Day School, where she serves on the board of trustees, and asking the judge if she supports schools teaching kids they can choose their gender. Bump called this an ""obvious bad-faith ploy"" that was ""so bad.""

The journalist suggested Blackburn's claims about the school pushing transgender ideology on students couldn't be verified.

""[A] reporter’s efforts to determine whether this is true came up short, including after asking Blackburn’s office,"" Bump wrote. However, a simple Google search shows the Georgetown Day School's website is full of photos and pages touting their transgender ""read in days,"" transgender ""visibility"" signs, political activism and elementary age students holding up their ""transgender rights matter"" artwork.

Continuing his defense of Jackson, Bump suggested Blackburn's quotation of the late Justice Ginsburg's opinion in 1996 on physical differences between men and women, was outdated.

""What matters here is that the argument being made by Ginsburg was specific to the case at hand. Nor was Ginsburg adjudicating the definitions of ‘man’ and ‘woman,’ but, rather, the difference in access that our general understanding of those terms (particularly in 1996) meant in the context of the exclusions in place at VMI,"" he argued.

BONGINO: KETANJI BROWN JACKSON DISQUALIFIED HERSELF WITH THIS SINGLE CLAIM

Bump doubled down on this take later, calling the question, ""what is a woman"" an ""unanswerable"" question, in a tweet.

He tweeted, ""There's a cottage industry of asking unanswerable questions and then 'aha!'-ing when the question goes unanswered.""

Despite claiming it was too complicated to answer what the definition of what a woman is, Bump had no problem shooting down the Hunter Biden laptop story as a ""conspiracy theory,"" last October.

The State Department called Wednesday’s move “Russia’s latest unhelpful and unproductive step” in relations between the countries. It urged Russia “to end its unjustified expulsions of U.S. diplomats and staff.”

Several U.S. diplomats have already been expelled from the embassy. The U.S. has also removed 12 Russian United Nations representatives based in New York.

482,California bill to lower penalties for sexual relations with minor heads to Newsom's desk,Ronn Blitzer,"

A California bill that would remove a requirement for offenders to register as a sex offender after committing certain sex acts with minors within a 10-year age difference is set to go to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk after passing in both legislative houses.

The bill, SB 145, applies in cases where the victim is between the ages of 14 and 17 and aims to lift an existing registration requirement for oral and anal sex. The state senate and assembly both voted to approve the bill on Tuesday despite Republican opposition in the Senate and bipartisan opposition in the assembly.

CALIFORNIA PROSECUTOR SAYS LOOTERS 'NEEDS' SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN CHARGED

""If signed into law, a 24-year-old could have sexual relations with a 15-year-old child without being required to register as a sex offender,"" Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove tweeted Tuesday.

State Senator Scott Wiener, who introduced the bill, claims it is meant to treat LGBT offenders the same as heterosexual offenders, as there is already a similar exemption from mandatory registration for vaginal intercourse between partners of a similar age difference.

""This irrational discrimination on the sex offender registry was created when California banned LGBT sex,"" Wiener said in a statement when a version of the bill passed the state senate in May 2019. ""This distinction between vaginal intercourse and other forms of intercourse is a relic of California's discriminatory past, and it's time to bring an end to it.""

Wiener continued: ""Going on the sex-offender registry can ruin a young person's life, making it harder for them to find a job and housing. We need to put an end to this terrible discrimination.""

Wiener's statements and a press release on his website discussed situations such as when an 18-year-old has sex with a 17-year-old but did not address the more extreme scenarios such as those mentioned by Grove.

483,New legislation would prevent the intelligence community from spying on Americans,Kelsey Koberg,"

EXCLUSIVE: Legislation introduced Thursday by Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, would prevent intelligence agencies like the CIA from spying on American citizens, a move Stewart said he believes will resonate with both Republicans and Democrats.

""The awesome power of the CIA should never be turned on U.S. persons, never. Even if they're law-breakers, that’s the responsibility of the FBI, not the CIA,"" Stewart told Fox News Digital.

The legislation would add a section to the National Security Act of 1947 banning the intelligence community from conducting any activity that is not related to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, and would also clarify terms in the law Stewart believes could be ""exploited.""

REP. CHRIS STEWART: BIDEN TEAM'S TERRIFYING PLAN TO SPY ON AMERICANS - HERE'S WHY WE MUST STOP THIS ABUSE

Stewart likened the legislation to a fence.

""It fences out the … intelligence community. It does it by redefining specific words. ‘Foreign intelligence includes,’ … to ‘foreign intelligence means,'"" Stewart said.

""We’re defining it clearly so that they can’t misinterpret it,"" he continued. ""We’re adding great clarity to the fence around the intelligence community.""

Stewart said the Biden administration’s focus on White supremacy and domestic violent extremists as the most persistent and lethal threat facing the United States underscored the necessity for his legislation.

Shortly after being sworn into office, President Biden requested a ""comprehensive threat assessment"" on domestic violent extremism from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees agencies like the CIA. The result of the assessment said domestic violent extremists posed a ""heightened threat.""

The administration’s national strategy for countering domestic terrorism, released later in the year, warned that White supremacy and ""militia violent extremists"" present the ""most persistent and lethal threats"" to the nation.

Stewart disagreed with this assessment.

""The great threats facing our nation are foreign,"" he said. ""They are, obviously right now Vladimir Putin, President Xi in China, the mullahs in Iran, North Korea. Those are the things our intelligence community should be focusing on, not domestic threats. Again, that's the FBI.""

Stewart predicted the legislation would get bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate, but was not confident it could gain the president's signature.

Stewart also said that he believes the legislation will be popular among both Republicans and Democrats across the country.

""I don’t know many Democrats who say ‘yeah, turn the CIA on my neighbors, that’s a great idea,’"" he said. ""You don’t have to poll this to know this is the way American people feel.

484,"Russia’s Ministry of Defense Head Sergei Shoigu reportedly missing, hasn't made public appearances in 12 days",Danielle Wallace,"

The head of Russia's Ministry of Defense Sergei Shoigu has not been seen in public for 12 days and is possibly missing, according to reports and messages circulated on Telegram on Wednesday.

Investigative journalists from the Russian independent news outlets Mediazona and Agentstvo claimed on Wednesday that the normally media savvy Shoigu has not appeared in public since March 11.

There are rumors that Shoigu is in poor health and is experiencing heart problems, while other messages are swirling online suggest Shoigu might have been fired from the ministry and is on house arrest, according to Russian journalists. Fox News has not yet independently verified these allegations.

TOP RUSSIAN GENERAL REPORTEDLY DETAINED AS PUTIN TARGETS ‘TRAITORS’ AMID UKRAINE INVASION

Shoigu was last seen in public on March 11 presenting awards to Russian troops occupying Ukraine during what Russian President Vladimir Putin dubbed a ""special military operation"" but what the West has condemned as a full-scale invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine.

The Kremlin said in a statement on its website on March 18 that Shoigu was present during a meeting Putin called with members of his security council to discuss ""the progress of the special operation in Ukraine,"" but no photos or videos of the meeting were posted online.

The Russian state-run Channel 1 aired a broadcast that same day, March 18, about Shoigu presenting military awards ""today"" but used an image of the ceremony that had already been posted on the Ministry of Defense’s website seven days earlier on March 11, according to Agentstvo.

Russian journalist Dmitry Treschanin, of Mediazona, noted that Russian state-run news agency RIA also hasn’t reported about Shoigu since March 11. He questioned whether Shoigu was in Chernobaevka, located outside of Kherson, the first major city to be occupied by Russian forces on March 2.

""Listen, the great PR minister Shoigu has been out of public space since March 11th,"" Treschanin tweeted on Wednesday. ""ELEVEN DAYS OF WAR, we do not have the head of the Ministry of Defense.""

Moscow Times reporter Jake Cordell tweeted on Wednesday about ""lots of Telegram chatter today about the whereabouts of Russia’s defense minister Sergei Shoigu,"" noting that Shoigu has not been seen with Putin since a meeting in Moscow on Feb. 27, just three days after beginning the invasion of Ukraine. It was at that meeting when Putin ordered Shoigu and the chief of the general staff of the armed forces of Russia, Valery Gerasimov, to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert.

Russian newspaper Pravda, citing the Russian investigative outlets, reported that Gerasimov also hasn’t made any public appearances since March 11. According to Agenstvo, Shoigu has made media appearances a priority since becoming Minister of Defense in 2012 and had appeared on television nearly every day since the start of the invasion of Ukraine up until March 11.

This comes as Russian forces on the ground have stalled after suffering heavy casualties, while continuing their bombardment and air strikes targeting major population centers in Ukrainian cities.

NATO said Wednesday that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine.

485,"America too dependent on China for its medicine, experts warn",Bryan Llenas,"

Experts are warning America has become too dependent on China for its medicine -- everything from painkillers, to antibiotics, and even aspirin can all be sourced back to a country the Department of Defense considers an adversary.

The Food and Drug Administration estimates that at least 80 percent of the active ingredients found in all of America's medicines come from abroad – primarily China.

""Imagine if China turned off that spigot,"" said Rosemary Gibson, author of ""China RX: The Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine."" ""China's aim is to become the global pharmacy to the world -- it says that. It wants to disrupt, to dominate, and displace American and other Western companies.""

In 2015, China unveiled ""Made in China 2025,"" a national plan to make it the world's leader in 10 high-tech manufacturing sectors, including bio-medicine, by 2025.

The new national security warning comes as China is threatening to weaponize its dominance in mining rare earth minerals against the United States, in an escalation of the ongoing trade war.

CHINA IS FIGHTING TO 'PROTECT ITS LEGITIMATE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS' IN TRADE WAR WITH US, STATE MEDIA SAYS

""I have no doubt that they would consider weaponizing their dominance of the pharmaceuticals market if they felt that that would give them an advantage over us strategically,"" retired Brig. Gen. John Adams told Fox News. Adams is also president of Guardian Six, a defense research consulting firm.

In a worst-case scenario, experts warn, China could withhold supply of medicines like important antibiotics, or degrade the quality of our medicines -- even put lethal contaminants in them. Even when it comes to treating anthrax, China is the largest exporter of the building block to make ciprofloxacin, an anthrax antidote.

The more probable threat from China, however, is that it could make America's prescription drugs more expensive.

""In five to 10 years, when China has a complete chokehold over the United States and its supply of medicine, it's gonna be telling us how much to pay for our medicine,"" Gibson told Fox News. ""We will lose control over how much we pay. We will be the price taker, not the price setter. And that's devastating.""

Gibson said China wants to do with medicine what it has done with steel.

""China dumped its steel in the United States at below-market price and it drove out so many factories and jobs and communities were devastated. We have the same story with a lot of our medicines and that happened with penicillin,"" Gibson said.

US NEEDS TO STAND UP TO CHINA ON TRADE WAR, WILL WIN IF IT DOES: ANDY PUZDER

The last U.S. plant manufacturing the penicillin antibiotic closed in 2004.

China is also positioning itself to dominate the generic drug industry. Generic drugs account for 90 percent of prescriptions filled in the United States. Already, generic versions of high blood pressure meds, anti-depressants, and cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, can be traced back to China. Today, India is the leader in generic drug manufacturing but China provides India with 80 percent of its raw ingredients, according to estimates.

Adding to the national security threat, generic drugs sourced back to China are used by America's military troops and veterans. The problem is health care providers -- including military hospitals -- do not know where all their drugs are sourced because pharmaceutical companies are not required to publicly disclose the source of their active ingredients.

""Knowing the scope of the problem,"" Adams said. ""I think that's the start.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement to Fox News that pharmaceutical companies must be able to trace the origin of their ingredients.

""American consumers have a right to know where the ingredients in their medications are coming from, regardless of whether they are brand or generic,"" Brown said.

In a 2010 study of pharmaceutical executives, 70 percent of respondents cited China as their top source country for pharmaceutical ingredients. But Gibson said pharmaceutical companies don't want to disclose China as a source of their medicine because Americans are less trustworthy of their products.

The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission will be holding a hearing on this potential threat and vulnerability on July 31. As for solutions, experts like Gibson and Adams are calling on the U.S. to bring back America's medicinal manufacturing prowess.

""We'd be fools not to understand,"" Adams said. ""They have a goal of having authority or having power over us and economic power is for them part of their national security. We should look at it in much the same way.""",https://www.foxnews.com
486,Tucker Carlson: The questions about the biolabs in Ukraine that everyone should be asking,Tucker Carlson,"

Wednesday, we told you that the Biden administration is funding a number of secretive biolabs in Ukraine, labs that are conducting experiments on highly dangerous pathogens. Now, that's not a story as we told you, that we wanted to do. In fact, we didn't think it could be true. It's so over-the-top and bizarre and in any case, the administration had repeatedly and very aggressively denied that they were doing anything like this and then they attacked anyone who has questions about it as a tool of Russia.

We foolishly assumed that in this one instance, they might be telling the truth and then out of nowhere, the Biden official in charge of Ukraine confirmed the story. Toria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State, casually mentioned in a Senate hearing on Tuesday that actually, yes, the Biden administration does fund a series of biolabs in Ukraine and whatever is in these labs is so dangerous that she is deeply concerned these materials will fall into the hands of the Russian military.

Now, that struck us as a shocking development. Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true. Toria Nuland's testimony raised at least two immediate questions. What exactly are these labs doing with our money and in our name? And why didn't the Biden administration secure the contents of these labs before the Russians invaded?

WHO DOCUMENTS RUSSIAN ATTACKS AGAINST 21 UKRAINE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES; WEST CONDEMNS

So far, we haven't received any answer at all to the second question. We think we're the only ones who have even asked it. Whoever decided to leave deadly biological materials sitting in Ukraine as Russian troops massed on the border has not yet been identified. We hope that person will be identified. We'll keep asking.

As for the first question, what exactly is going on in these labs? We've gotten several answers, all of them insulting. Initially, the administration claimed the labs were designed to help the Ukrainians fight tuberculosis, as well as various livestock diseases. That's what officials told members of Congress. It didn't seem plausible and, in fact, it's not plausible. And then after our show last night, the Pentagon released what it non-ironically called a fact sheet designed to make the biolab story seem small and ridiculous. Virtually every news organization in America, with almost no exceptions, repeated the administration's claim verbatim with no verification of any kind.

Foreign Policy Magazine ran this version of it, which was identical to many other versions you saw if you follow the news today. ""FACT CHECK: DoD has worked with Ukraine to ELIMATE (in all caps) bioweapons left behind by the Soviet Union since 2005,"" said a senior U.S. defense intelligence official, ""but these are NOT (again, in all caps) weapons labs as Russians falsely claim,"" the official said.

The Washington Post assured us of the same thing, so did countless other so-called news organizations. OK, so no big deal. This is not actually a story. The Pentagon's been doing it since 2005, working with Ukrainians to ""eliminate biological weapons left behind by the Soviets."" That makes sense, but wait. 2005 was 17 years ago. How long does it take to eliminate Soviet bioweapons? Seventeen years seems like a long time. If you had 17 years and ample funding from Congress, you could probably remove and catalog every grain of sand on Waikiki Beach and yet somehow, over that same period 17 years, the Pentagon has not finished removing test tubes from Soviet-era freezers.

How does that work exactly? How heavy are these bioweapons? Do we lack the transportation capacity to get them out of Ukraine and bury them in the desert in Nevada? When was the Pentagon planning to finish this important job? In 20 years? In 50 years? Those all seem like very obvious questions, but not a single reporter asked any of those questions.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: FORMER AG BARR SAYS US ‘CAN’T ALLOW THIS TO ESCALATE INTO A NUCLEAR WAR’

Meanwhile, over at CNN, perhaps where the first explanation didn't make sense once you thought about it, offered a new alibi. According to CNN's site, the labs in Ukraine exist to ""secure old Soviet weapons."" Ok, secure, not eliminate, which raises the question: what does it mean to secure a bioweapon? And again, why has it taken 17 years to do it? And by the way, if these are really just old Soviet weapons, why is Toria Nuland so worried they will wind up in the hands of old Soviets who presumably already have these very same weapons—probably don't need more. It's absurd when you think about it. So, don't think about it and that was the point of today's coverage of the Biden administration's secret Ukrainian biolabs. Stop thinking about it. Start accepting what they tell you at face value. Otherwise, you are an agent of Russia. Here's CNN:

KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCHER: The foreboding music, biohazard warnings. This Russian state media footage from 2015 claims to show America running facilities in Ukraine and Georgia that caused deadly outbreaks of disease and killed local livestock. This story is false, but that has not stopped it continuing to circulate, evolving from biological hazards to biological weapons and becoming a key part of Russia's disinformation campaign justifying the invasion of Ukraine. The claims were debunked several years ago, when in 2020, the United States issued a statement to ""set the record straight,"" explaining the facilities are in fact for vaccine development and to report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens before they pose security or stability threats.

""These claims were debunked several years ago."" These facilities work on vaccines and reporting outbreak, and then they play Russian propaganda. The point is anyone who asks questions about this is repeating Russian propaganda. Got it? And the truth is, we're not interested in what Russian propagandists say about these Ukrainian biolabs. We're not interested in what the propagandists at CNN say about these biolabs. We're Americans, so we would like, in fact, we think we have a right to demand the Biden administration to answer simple questions, straightforward questions. These are obviously questions important enough to make Toria Nuland very nervous. But why? We don't know. They won't answer.

So, instead, we did some digging of ourselves to see what we could find and here's we came up with. The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Robert Pope, the man who heads the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at DOD, sat for an interview with the website Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Pope was the man in charge of securing or eliminating Soviet-era bioweapons, so he knows a lot about the subject, maybe more than anyone else, but it turns out that not all of these Soviet weapons are being destroyed or even secured, and Pope acknowledged that in the interview, which apparently CNN didn't see.

According to his interview, Pope said the labs ""may hold pathogen strains left over from the Soviet bioweapons program preserved in freezers for research purposes."" Pope said that ""scientists, being scientists, it wouldn't surprise me if some of these strange collections and some of these laboratories still have pathogen strains that go all the way back to the origins of that program.""

US VOWS TO HALT GASLIGHTING AFTER RUSSIA ASKS UN SECURITY COUNCIL FOR SPECIAL MEETING ON ‘BIOLABS’ IN UKRAINE

In other words, because as Pope put it, ""scientists are scientists,"" they don't want to destroy all the bioweapons. Instead, they're using them to conduct new bioweapons research. That's what he said and not just on strains left over from the Soviet Union. The second lie. In fact, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has acknowledged joint American and Ukrainian research on other pathogens such as hemorrhagic fever virus. Apparently, there's a lot of this going on in Ukraine funded by the United States. Did you know that? Why Ukraine? We don't know. We can only guess.

We do know that in 2010, the U.S. government helped fund construction of a brand-new level-3 biolab in Odessa, Ukraine. The purpose of that lab was not to eliminate or secure aging Soviet weapons. No. That lab was designed for research a new and ""especially dangerous pathogens"" in Ukraine, the poorest country in Europe. Again, not a hotbed of biomedical research. Why Ukraine? We don't know. Someone should find out.

We do know that the Pentagon talking points you saw reported as fact on television today and last night were an utter lie. Did the reporters, who repeated those talking points verbatim, know they were a lie? Maybe they did. On the other hand, how would they know? They didn't bother to do any reporting whatsoever. They got a text from some Biden administration flack and they just read it on the air like it was true. You shouldn't be surprised because that's what they do and it's possible they're afraid not to do that. They know if they stray from the script the White House has written for them, they'll be denounced from the briefing room as tools of Putin. Here's Biden's publicist doing the very same thing today:

PRESS SECRETARY JEN PSAKI: The main issue that prompted my Twitter thread yesterday was that Russia has a history also of inventing outright lies like this, which is the suggestion that the United States has a chemical and biological weapons program, or Ukraine does, that they're operating. Russia is the one, is the country, that has a chemical and biological weapons program. So, the objective was to make clear the inaccuracy of the information, the misinformation they're trying to put out, and make clear to the world that they not only have the capacity, they have a history of using chemical and biological weapons, and that, in this moment, we should have our eyes open.

Yeah, but no one denies that. That's the thing. No one denies that Russia has a chem bio program. That's bad. No one denies that Russia lies, of course, and has for a long time, that Russian propaganda is absolutely real, of course. That's not for debate. That's all true.

The question is: Why is the United States funding these biolabs that are not doing anything close to what the Pentagon claims they are doing? Why is the White House press secretary from the podium contradicting what the director of the Pentagon's bioweapons control program has already admitted is true? Why is she doing that and how should we feel about all of this? Insulted, but also very concerned. There is absolutely a story here, a story that matters, clearly. That's why they're lying about it.",https://www.foxnews.com

McCarthy said the conference, which runs from Wednesday to Friday in Ponte Vedra, Fla., is where Republican members of Congress will roll out their ""commitment to America"" ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, so that the public ""knows exactly what we’ll do if we are fortunate enough to become the majority.""

""Our party is unified based on these Democrat policies that have created so much damage to America,"" McCarthy said, making a pitch to voters.

""We’re going to tell them to join with us. It’s not our time— it is our time as Americans,"" McCarthy said.

If they’re concerned about their border not being secured, we can secure it. If they are concerned about parents not having a say in their kids’ education, we believe they have a right to that. If they’re concerned about the weakness from the White House, we believe in peace through strength,"" McCarthy continued.

492,Homeland Security report finds White supremacy ‘the most consistent and lethal threat’,Stephanie Pagones,"

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security considers White supremacists and other “domestic violent extremists” as presenting “the most persistent and lethal threat” to the nation, the agency revealed in a report on Tuesday.

The DHS’s “Homeland Threat Assessment” found that White supremacy extremism accounted for more fatal attacks in the U.S. than any other domestic violent extremist group since 2018, with eight of the 16 violent reported from 2018 through 2019. It also caused the majority of related deaths, with 39 of the 48, the report states.

“I am concerned about any form of violent extremism. That is why we design our programs to be threat agnostic – ensuring that we can combat a broad range of domestic threats,” wrote Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf in the report. “However, I am particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists who have been exceptionally lethal in their abhorrent, targeted attacks in recent years.”

The much-anticipated report was published Tuesday and was said to be the first-of-its-kind by outlining threat analysis and information from “across DHS including intelligence and operational components.”

WOLF TAKES AIM AT 'FABRICATED' COMPLAINTS, REPORTS AT CONFIRMATION HEARING

“This HTA is as close as the American people will get to seeing and understanding the information that I see,” Wolf said in a statement included in a related press release on Tuesday. “When the American people read this HTA they will be more aware of the traditional threats facing the Homeland like terrorism and organized crime. However, I think they will also realize that we face a significant threat in the Homeland from nation-states like China, Russia, and Iran.”

White supremacist extremists, or WSEs, have consistently remained prominent among domestic extremist groups, while spikes in other forms of DVE typically depend on social or political issues at the time, the report states.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION UNVEILS SWEEPING CHANGES TO CONTROVERSIAL H-1B GUEST WORKER PROGRAM

The threat analysis also identifies anti-government or anti-authority violent extremism as a factor that motivates domestic terrorism.

“These violent extremists, sometimes influenced by anarchist ideology, have been associated with multiple plots and attacks, which included a significant uptick in violence against law enforcement and government symbols in 2020,” the report states. “Anti-government and/or anti-authority violent extremists are likely to be emboldened by a perceived success exploiting otherwise peaceful protest movements and concealing violent tactics.”

DHS agents have suffered more than 300 injuries at the hands of “anarchist extremists” who have, at times, been armed with weapons such as metal pipes, sledgehammers, improvised explosive devices and commercial-grade fireworks, the report states.

“These violent extremists are increasingly taking advantage of large protest crowds to conduct violence against government officials, facilities, and counter-protestors,” the report continues. “Ideologies driven by such DVE’s often are reinforced by a variety of online content, including conspiracy theories and political commentary they view as controversial.”

493,Former House stenographer who went on religious rant speaks out,Chad Pergram,"

It is just a few steps from the floor of the House of Representatives to the lectern where the president of the United States delivers his annual State of the Union message.

But former House of Representatives stenographer Dianne Reidy believes the journey which took her to the rostrum last fall began nine years ago. Long before Reidy commandeered the dais in the House chamber and began a religious-themed rant during last October's vote to end the partial government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.

Reidy's rant made her the most famous stenographer in the world.

It also got her fired.

""When I walked into the building for my interview, I knew this is where God had me for his purpose. Not my skills. But he would have me strategically placed at the House of Representatives and I never knew the purpose of it,"" Reidy said in an interview with Fox News, speaking out months later about the bizarre episode which startled lawmakers at the time.

Reidy tried to offer her side. She believed her hiring to document and transcribe what lawmakers say all day in press conferences, at hearings and on the floor -- was God's plan. Set in motion nearly a decade ago and culminating during one of the most important and watched roll call votes in recent memory.

""I still felt that there was more of a purpose in this than just my family's security and a great salary,"" said Reidy. ""It was leading up to this. God was revealing to me this is the purpose that I was sent there for.""

An inferno consumed Capitol Hill last fall. Congress morphed into a combustible tinderbox as the entire federal government largely shuttered for the first time in nearly 17 years. Lawmakers traded opprobrium in a pitched standoff with the White House. Tempers flared as the surly atmosphere spilled over into debates about closed monuments and political motives. Tensions erupted over one warm afternoon during the partial shutdown as 34-year-old Miriam Carey led U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) and the U.S. Secret Service on a mad chase through the streets of Washington and around the Capitol. The pursuit ended with the spectacular crash of a USCP cruiser followed by officers shooting and killing the unarmed Carey by the Hart Senate Office Building.

It was almost too much. The car chase was the last thing anyone needed as lawmakers, aides and journalists all dreaded heading to work each day -- sleep-deprived, angst-ridden and testy.

They weren't the only ones losing sleep. It was a fitful time for Dianne Reidy, too.

A few weeks after the chase, Reidy would shock lawmakers during the big vote -- jammering about God, Satan, a ""house divided"" and a ""deception"" that the U.S. was ""one nation under God."" But in her words, Reidy didn't initially comprehend why she wasn't sleeping.

""The Lord was waking me up in the middle of the night for about two weeks straight. I had that stirring in my spirit. Something was going on. He was doing something in me. So I was just getting into the word of God. Getting into the Bible every night for two weeks,"" Reidy said. ""It was very, very peaceful. The scriptures really came to life for me, you know, speaking to me.""

Reidy says those nocturnal Bible studies led her to the book of Revelation and Joel, one of the 12 books of minor prophets. Joel centers around a national call to repent and a reward from God.

""It was clear to me that this was about judgment on our nation -- that it was a warning for our nation. And it was also about God extending his gift of mercy,"" Reidy said.

Reidy says she wasn't sure how this would all play out until three days before the pivotal vote. It all came into sharper focus as efforts intensified to re-open the government.

""I was praying all day and the days leading up to it. Lord, crucify my flesh because in my flesh I cannot do it. I do not want to get up and do this. This is not my thing. This is God's thing,"" Reidy said.

On the House floor, eight stenographers rotate in 15 minute shifts to document what lawmakers say. Reidy said it soon became clear in her mind that her shift would come up during the vote to re-open the government and hike the debt limit.

""The Lord had positioned me for that perfect timing,"" Reidy said, noting she didn't know that she would speak before the House. And Reidy said when she did launch into her oration, she could have done it from a number of podiums throughout the chamber. She ultimately wound up at the one of the dais where the president addresses Congress and the nation during State of the Union.

Reidy says she doesn't remember much after that as she casually strode to the dais and asked Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who was presiding over the vote, if the microphones were switched on.

Reidy then began, stunning lawmakers milling about on the floor. Reidy's voice strained above the din, starting with ""God will not be mocked.'

Chamber security personnel soon lugged Reidy off the dais and into the hall before stuffing her in an elevator. WNYC-FM reporter Todd Zwillich and Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times snared a brief recording of Reidy in the corridor. Along the way, Reidy shouted ""This is not one nation under God. It never was"" and ""the Constitution would not have been built by Free Masons.""

""I am happy to have that recording because I have no memory of what was said,"" noted Reidy.

The elevator doors closed as Reidy spat out one last proclamation.

""Praise be to God, Lord Jesus Christ,"" exhorted Reidy.

And it was over.

In the aftermath, Reidy says some people believe her when she tells them it was the Holy Spirit speaking.

""Then there is the camp that thinks I was stressed out from work and had a breakdown,"" Reidy said. ""For those who don't believe that it was the Holy Spirit speaking and that I'm a lunatic, I would just say, what if you're wrong?""

Reidy said she presumed she'd be fired and even thought she may be arrested. That didn't happen. But she and her husband are now losing their home.

""It came down to a choice. Do I choose the worldly things? The beautiful home that we've raised our beautiful twin, eight-year-old daughters in? Or do I choose the Lord? Do I choose God? That's a no-brainer for me. I choose God.""

And as to whether God's message got through, Reidy says she isn't sure.

""Only God knows,"" she said.",https://www.foxnews.com

A gunman wearing a FedEx driver's uniform on Sunday killed the son and wounded the husband of a federal judge linked to high-profile cases involving Jeffrey Epstein, a ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" couple and gangs, in a shocking murder now being probed by the FBI.

The shooting occurred at the North Brunswick, N.J., home of Judge Esther Salas, a source told The Associated Press. The AP report, citing the state’s chief district judge, said the son, 20, was killed. NJ.com reported that the shooting occurred at about 5 p.m.

‘RHONJ’ STAR TERESA GIUDICE 'VERY SHAKEN' BY NEWS OF ATTACK ON JUDGE'S FAMILY: ATTORNEY

“The FBI is investigating a shooting at the home of Judge Salas. We are working with our local and state partners,” Doreen Holder, the public information officer for the bureau’s Newark office, told Fox News.

U.S. Marshals and state and local authorities are also investigating.

Salas' husband, defense lawyer Mark Anderl, 63, was injured, the AP reported. Salas was in the basement at the time and wasn't hurt, the report said.

CHICAGO'S VIOLENT WEEKEND SEES AT LEAST 8 KILLED, 40 OTHERS SHOT, POLICE SAY

The gunman posed as a delivery driver for FedEx, two sources told NJ.com. The report said that Salas, 51, was the first Hispanic female appointed to the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.

Daniel Anderl, a college student, was the judge's only child, the AP reported.

A FedEx spokesperson said the company is ""fully cooperating"" with the investigation.

Salas' highest-profile case in recent years was the financial fraud case involving ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" reality TV stars Teresa and Joe Giudice, whom Salas sentenced to prison for crimes including bankruptcy fraud and tax evasion. Salas staggered their sentences so that one of them could be available to take care of their four children.

In an emailed statement provided to Fox News, Teresa Giudice's attorney, James Leonard Jr., called the news ""absolutely devastating.""

“Teresa was very shaken by the news and was very emotional when she heard about it,"" Leonard wrote. ""She told me that would be praying very heavily for Judge Salas and her family.""

In 2016, Salas sentenced a Crips gang member to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

In 2017, she barred federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against an alleged gang leader charged in several Newark slayings, ruling the man's intellectual disability made him ineligible for capital punishment. Salas later sentenced the man to 45 years in prison, the AP reported.

Salas has presided over an ongoing lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank investors who claim the company made false and misleading statements about its anti-money laundering policies and failed to monitor ""high-risk"" customers including convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The White House on Friday insisted the U.S. military will not be deployed to Ukraine amid Russia’s multifront war on the country after comments President Biden made to troops in Poland seemed to suggest otherwise.

Biden, visiting U.S. service members in Poland, talked about how average Ukrainian citizens are ""stepping up.""

""You’re going to see when you’re there – some of you have been there – you’re going to see women, young people, standing in the middle, in front of a damn tank, saying, ‘I’m not leaving.'""

501,"Manhattan DA Bragg suspended Trump investigation 'indefinitely,' stopped pursuing charges",Brooke Singman,"

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg stopped pursuing charges against former President Trump and suspended the investigation ""indefinitely,"" one of the top prosecutors who resigned from the office said in his resignation letter--but disagreed with the decision.

Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, who had been leading the investigation under former DA Cyrus Vance, submitted their resignations last month, after Bragg began raising doubts about pursuing a case against Trump.

TOP PROSECUTORS IN MANHATTAN DA CASE AGAINST TRUMP RESIGN

""You have reached the decision not to go forward with the grand jury presentation and not to seek criminal charges at the present time,"" Pomerantz wrote in his resignation letter, first reported by the New York Times. ""The investigation has been suspended indefinitely.""

""Of course, that is your decision to make,"" Pomerantz wrote to Bragg. ""I do not question your authority to make it, and I accept that you have made it sincerely.""

However, Pomerantz said that ""a decision made in good faith may nevertheless be wrong.""

""I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest,"" Pomerantz wrote. ""I therefore cannot continue in my current position.""

Pomerantz wrote that he believed Trump was ""guilty of numerous felony violations"" and said it would be a ""grave failure of justice not to prosecute him.""

Pomerantz and Dunne had previously agreed to stay on in the district attorney’s office after Vance’s term expired in January and Bragg took the helm.

At the time, Bragg said he was getting up to speed on the Trump investigation and vowed to ""follow the facts.""

""It’s a matter that’s personally, as you would imagine, on my radar screen and that I’m mindful of and paying attention to,"" Bragg said.

But while Pomerantz and his team were prepared to move forward with charges against Trump, Bragg was not.

But despite that decision, Pomerantz, in his resignation letter, claimed his team that had been investigating Trump ""harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes—he did.""

But a source familiar with the investigation pointed Fox News Digital, specifically, to Trump’s ""Statement of Financial Condition,"" which reports an entity’s assets, liabilities and abilities to raise and use funds.

TRUMP SLAMS NEW YORK POLITICIANS, LEAVES DOOR OPEN ON RETURN TO NYC

The source told Fox News Digital that Trump did not inflate his financial statements, as prosecutors had anticipated, but instead, undervalued his assets.

The source also told Fox News that Trump never defaulted on payments to banks, and said his statement of financial condition included ""caveats"" which ""refuted"" claims by the DA’s office.

One source familiar with the investigation claimed the case against Trump was political and fueled by the former president's political enemies, and told Fox News that Pomerantz ""shouldn't have been in the DA's office in the first place.""

Before joining Vance's office, Pomerantz was of counsel at New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. He took leave from the firm last year to join Vance’s office to investigate Trump’s financial dealings.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s brother, Robert Schumer, is a partner at the firm. Pomerantz donated to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

""It is a great tribute to the system that Alvin Bragg came in and stopped the unfairness against Trump,"" a source close to the investigation told Fox News. ""Bragg and his team did the legally and morally correct thing, and they didn’t go the typical political route.""

The source added that Bragg and his team ""realized they had no case, they stopped it.""

""Bragg said the case is not provable,"" the source said.

While many close to the investigation have signaled that it has been closed—specifically after Pomerantz and Dunne’s resignations—a spokesperson for Bragg insisted the probe ""continues.""

""A team of experienced prosecutors is working every day to follow the facts and the law,"" the spokesperson told Fox News. ""There is nothing we can or should say at this juncture about an ongoing investigation.""

But former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Andy McCarthy, told Fox News that there are ""many cases"" in prosecutors offices that have not been closed, saying that is ""of no importance.""

""What matters is whether there is activity in the investigation,"" McCarthy said. ""The technical matter of whether an office file is opened or closed is of no importance—the only thing that matters is are prosecutors actively investigating and is the grand jury collecting new evidence.""

Back in November, during the final weeks of Vance’s tenure, the Manhattan DA’s Office convened a new grand jury. That grand jury was set to run for six months.

""That means, come April they were up against a deadline with the grand jury,"" McCarthy told Fox News. ""If they hadn’t indicted by April, they would have had to decide whether to try to extend the grand jury term or start the investigation all over again with a new grand jury.""

A spokesperson for Bragg did not comment on whether his office could attempt to extend the grand jury term.

Bragg reportedly has told aides that in order for the case to move forward, new evidence would need to be discovered—but investigators reportedly view that scenario unlikely.

Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyer Ronald Fischetti told the New York Times that Pomerantz ""had the opportunity to present the fruits of his investigation to the D.A. and his senior staff on several occasions and failed.""

But for the content of the case, McCarthy told Fox News that ""inflating or deflating asset values is a commonality in industry.""

""A lot of it is legal, some of it is illegal, but it is almost never prosecuted,"" McCarthy told Fox News. ""And if they singled out Trump for prosecution, they would have a very significant selective prosecution defense to deal with.""

McCarthy also warned that had Bragg gone forward with the case, he would have had ""a tabloid war with Trump and some of the New York media.""

""The only way to do something like that is to have a very strong case,"" McCarthy said. ""And in Bragg’s case, because he is a progressive prosecutor, it would have been a very bad look for him to be singling out Trump on comparatively trivial crimes, when he is lax in the prosecution of serious criminals in New York City.""

The investigation was opened by Vance in 2019 and was focused on possible bank, insurance and tax fraud. The case involved financial dealings of Trump’s Manhattan properties, including his flagship Fifth Avenue building, Trump Tower, and the valuation of his 213-acre estate Seven Springs in Westchester.

The probe led to tax fraud charges last July against The Trump Organization, and its finance chief Allen Weisselberg.

Weisselberg was accused of collecting more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation, including apartment rent, car payments and school tuition.

Both Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have pleaded not guilty.

502,"South Carolina boater who fatally shot jet skier he tried to rescue had no choice, slain man's pal says",Rebecca Rosenberg,"

The boater who rescued a jet skier from drowning in a South Carolina lake and then fatally shot him had no choice after the man went berserk, the victim's friend told investigators.

""Nothing worked,"" Hannah Ayers, 19, said of trying to calm down Drew Morgan, 29 on the afternoon of March 15 in Lake Keowee, according to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital.

""John just had to shoot him,"" she said of stranger John Dotson Jr. 74, who she credited with saving her life after she and Morgan fell off a jet ski near Fall Creek.

The Oconee County Sheriff's Office previously announced that Dotson would not be charged in Morgan's death.

NO CHARGES FOR SOUTH CAROLINA MAN WHO SHOT JET SKIER DEAD AFTER RESCUING HIM

Ayers told the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview that Morgan became belligerent and violent after the Good Samaritan, who was fishing with his wife Debra Dotson, 70, spotted the pair struggling in the water and pulled the two onto their pontoon.

""Drew was my friend and I will mourn him as my friend,"" she said. ""But I will never understand the way he was acting that day – it's like a demon possessed his body.""

She added, ""In my eyes there was no question that John had to shoot to protect himself and his wife. He will be my hero for life because, if it wasn't for him, I would have drowned in the water that day.""

Ayers told investigators that Morgan had invited her to go jet skiing and look at waterfalls that day. But when she met up with him, he was clearly drunk and ""slurring his words,"" the incident report says.

Morgan began speeding on the jet ski and took a sharp turn, ejecting them both into the water. Neither of them had on life vests, and Ayers said she was a poor swimmer and could barely stay above water as the yellow jet ski circled nearby.

The Dotsons spotted the pair in distress and rescued them – but Morgan became agitated, cussed out the couple, then shoved the elderly wife all while demanding they take him back to his jet ski.

FIRING-SQUAD EXECUTIONS GET GREEN LIGHT IN SOUTH CAROLINA

There was snot and foam streaming from his nose and mouth, the Good Samaritan-turned-shooter told investigators.

A wild melee ensued and Morgan choked John and Debra Dotson, as he tried to take control of the boat, breaking the kill switch and making the vessel inoperable, the report says.

""All Drew cared about was getting his jet ski back,"" Ayers told authorities. Ayers started hitting Morgan to get him to stop assaulting the couple and finally shoved him off the boat.

But the Dotsons pulled the combative young man back onto their pontoon, and the conflict rapidly escalated.

John Dotson said he fired a warning shot and repeatedly pistol whipped Morgan, who had grabbed hold of his arm. But the crazed man wouldn't back down, and Dotson finally blasted him in the chest.

Debra Dotson immediately began performing CPR – but Morgan no longer had a pulse when deputies arrived.

After a 48-hour investigation, officials told the slain man's family that the shooter would not be charged. The sheriff's office also met with the 10th circuit solicitor's office who agreed with the decision after reviewing 911 calls, witness statements and videos, the incident report says.

Officials executed a search warrant on Morgan's white GMC pickup truck and recovered empty cans of Michelob Ultra in the front cab, marijuana and drug paraphernalia – including a bong, pipes and a blunt.

505,How to avoid 'Tinder Swindlers': ‘Boy Meets World' star-turned-adult actress Maitland Ward on 'red flags',Maitland Ward,"Netflix’s viral true-crime documentary ""The Tinder Swindler"" had millions of viewers crying foul after it began streaming on the platform Feb. 2.

The mind-bending story from director Felicity Morris, who also produced the Emmy-winning series, ""Don't F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"" chronicles the depths a Tinder user by the name of Shimon Hayut, now 31, would go to to charm women around the world into loaning him money – to the tune of an estimated $10 million.

Hayut posed as Simon Leviev and claimed to be the son of a diamond mogul on the popular dating app.

It was only when a group of women banded together to expose Leviev that his scheme was foiled, and he was ultimately convicted of fraud, theft and forgery. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison in December 2019, only to be released early after serving five months.

Former ""Boy Meets World"" star Maitland Ward, who now makes a large part of her living as an adult actress while also disseminating content to paying fans online, told Fox News Digital that while she empathizes with the women who were bilked out of millions of dollars by the Tinder Swindler, she believes all the warning signs were apparent in their interactions with Leviev.

""A major red flag should have been when they were trying to take money out over and over. I mean, when anybody asks you to do something you're not comfortable with, and they're pressuring you to do it, and they don't understand if you don't want to do it, that's a major, major red flag,"" Ward, 45, explained of the ruse Leviev had been running on unsuspecting women.

""A major red flag should have been when they were trying to take money out over and over."" — Maitland Ward

""Before he began asking for money, I can see why they fell for it because he showed the planes and all the money and dinners and stuff. But yeah, I think it's just this deep psychology in us to want to be loved and to want to have this fairy-tale dream. I really see with the people that are catfished, and I feel bad for them, I feel really bad for them that they fall for it.""

Leviev is a free man living in Israel while some women he duped are still paying the price for forking over their fortunes to the man infamously known as the Tinder Swindler.

Fox News Digital spoke with Ward about why she believes the ""Tinder Swindler"" was able to get away with what he was doing for so long, how she often receives messages from people on the internet that someone who is pretending to be her has catfished them, as well as her memoir based on her life post-mainstream television, titled ""My Escape From Hollywood: Why I Left to Become a Porn Star.""

Fox News Digital: What was the feeling you had when your book reached No. 1 in its category on Amazon when preorders launched?

Maitland Ward: It was just so amazing to see the reception that people were having for it. I just love it. It's going to be such a porn-positive book. It's like it's going to have a lot of dishy, funny, salacious stories from all the mainstream stuff I've worked on and things you've never heard before, I promise you.

I have some dish that nobody's heard, but then it's also going to be a story of female empowerment and my personal journey to find my true, authentic self and my sexuality and be comfortable with that. And you really have pride in that. And to take control of my life and my career when Hollywood was trying to fit me into a box. I was like making my own way out of the box, you know, out of the coffin of childhood fame or young celebrity.

I was carving my own way, and I think that's going to show all the way through the book. So it takes me from adolescence all the way up through all the projects that I've worked on in the mainstream and then, of course, how it got me on my journey to porn and then everything that goes on there.

‘BOY MEETS WORLD’ STAR-TURNED-PORN ACTRESS MAITLAND WARD MAKING RETURN TO TV: ‘I WANT TO SLAY BOTH INDUSTRIES’

Fox News Digital: Why do you think Leviev was able to get away with what he was doing for so long?

Ward: Yeah, it's interesting because, like myself, and a lot of other well-known people or celebrities and porn stars have people who catfish and pretend to be them all the time. And I'm always surprised that people fall for it so easily. Like, there are certain people that can fall for it really easily. And I think it's because they want to believe it. They want to believe they're talking to you. They want to believe they have a connection with you personally.

Like with [Leviev], they wanted to believe he's this handsome billionaire who is sweeping them off their feet or whatever. So they're believing in that fairy tale. And I think that's true as well with how people catfish fans. I'll get all the time people saying, ""I was screwed over by you"", and I'm like, ""It's not me."" They think it's me because they want to believe it's me. I mean, would I really want to be paid off in Google gift cards or whatever? They'll say to me, ""You were broke last year, you were leaving your husband and I gave you all these Amazon cards"" or whatever it is. And I'm like, ""Did you not see all the work I was doing?"" Just look online.

And then it always amazes me that they will believe this person, but then they'll find my verified account and then go after me and not correlate that, wait a minute, you found the real person there, but you believed it was me over here. And then they'll give these weird stories, these catfishers – like he did, ""Oh, I'm being hunted by somebody or the enemy is after me, so I need money."" Like they'll say, ""My husband is holding me hostage, or I want to leave porn."" That's a big deal. Or they'll say, ""I want to leave porn, but I can't. I have to get any money I can. Can you help me leave it?""

And then people will give thousands and thousands of dollars to whoever it is, and then they just run off, and the givers are left holding the bag. And it's crazy how many people can fall it. But I see how they do. You want to believe that dream. You want to believe that you're really talking to a celebrity or talking to a porn star or talking to a billionaire. It's a fairy tale and, unfortunately, in the computer world, you don't see them face to face, so they can use pictures, and they can use stories and stuff that they've collected on the internet and really, really play into the psyche of somebody who wants to believe in the fairy tale.

'BOY MEETS WORLD' STAR MAITLAND WARD DOING PORN: 'I FELT READY'

Fox News Digital: Why do you think people have the gumption to want to make a leap so quickly and jump into something without actually assessing the risk/reward of what could potentially go wrong?

Ward: That’s deep psychology, and I think as a society, we're just ingrained to believe in these fairy-tale moments. We want that life so bad, and we see it, so you just want to just believe it. Like if you're in love with a celebrity, and then you think they're talking to you, it would hurt too much to think this is not the truth. And it feels so good. It's an addiction. It's kind of like you get addicted to that ""wow"" feeling you have. You think you're going to marry this person, you're going to be with this person, and you’re helping this person.

ADULT FILM STAR MAITLAND WARD SHARES PHOTO FROM 'BOY MEETS WORLD' DAYS FOR SERIES FINALE 20TH ANNIVERSARY

But I also feel bad for them because they usually come at me angry that they've been catfished. ""You've done this to me,"" and they still can't believe it's not me. They don't want to believe it's not me. They'd rather believe that I did something wrong to them. But they're also very angry and hurt because they believed it and their dream has just been snatched away from them, and they've been used and had, and they just can't come to terms with that. So I am empathetic to that because it's easier to deal with the fact that you've been ripped off and wronged and that your heart was just broken like that.

Fox News Digital: Before you were married, how many of these dates had you gone on that you knew almost immediately you weren't compatible?

Ward: Yeah, many years ago. But this also has to do with friendships too because I'm very open sexually, and I work in an industry that's open sexually. So it's just any people. I think if they start off just talking about your career, and you're … I mean, it's okay to break the ice if they're a little nervous or something like that. But if they just want to know too much. For instance, I get a lot of guys wanting to date me and thinking that the move is to start talking to me sexually, and I'll just like immediately fall for them. Or some guys would make really dirty jokes that they think that are going to get them somewhere just because I'm a porn star. They don't understand how it's kind of like a catcall on the street.

""Does that ever really work? Has it ever worked?"" Never. It's the same kind of thing. But then there is the assumption that once you are a porn star, ""Well, then you must do it with everyone all the time."" And the floodgates come open, especially right after I started with Deeper and Vixen. People really start coming forward like, ""Oh, I haven't talked to you in a while. How's it going?"" So people just were figuring everyone had a chance, all of a sudden.

'BOY MEETS WORLD' STAR MAITLAND WARD SAYS PORN BRINGS NEW OPPORTUNITIES, PROMISES 'MORE TABOO STUFF TO COME'

But a genuine person who I would date or be friends with or whatever – you can tell they actually want to know about you, and they don't want to just focus on what you do, and I think that's always good. With anything, people should be asking questions about you as a person and not just surface questions. And it all depends on what you want to use the dating sites for. Some people are finding that they want to just hook up and that's fine. But if they're looking for a relationship and not to be screwed over for a long-term thing, you really need to have someone who gives it back and forth and isn't so focused on your porn career.

I mean, I would be so turned off if somebody just assumed they were going to sleep with me because I'm a porn star, and they didn't have to even talk to me or do anything. So you get that sleazy vibe, you can totally get it – and that's not sexy. I would probably sleep with you if you were engaging with me well. That would be way more of a turn-on, and you would have had much more of a chance to sleep with me than if you're just assuming it, and you're being just a total surface kind of a jerk.

And there are a lot out there. Although, I think if you're someone who picks those glossy kinds of people who aren't real actors or performers, but they know how to advertise themselves well, and they're so caught up in the perception of themselves online. I know actors and actresses have to present themselves in a certain way. But on Tinder, if they're … on any of these dating apps, that's the red flag.

Because I see some people I know who do it and just see some of these guys who are in their photos with their shirts off flexing their muscles, and they're on boats and with their Ferraris. Also, with the Tinder Swindler, the one thing I didn't understand — and I'm not victim shaming. But the one red flag that I did have at the very beginning – why would a handsome super billionaire have to be on Tinder? He would have so many people asking him out all the time. The diamond industry? Oh my God. I would think girls would be everywhere all over him.

506,Biden approval ratings plummet amid war and inflation fears in new public opinion poll,Jessica Chasmar,"

President Biden’s job approval rating has declined to 40%, the lowest level of his presidency, as the president continues to see eroding support from key demographics like independents and minority voters ahead of the midterm elections, a new poll shows.

Biden’s approval rating stands at 40%, down from 43% in January, while the number of voters who disapprove has increased by one percentage point to 55%, according to an NBC News poll released Sunday.

BIDEN SAYS DEMOCRATS IN ‘STRONGEST POSITION’ IN MONTHS; NEW POLL SUGGESTS THAT'S WISHFUL THINKING

Biden’s approval rating among Black respondents in the poll dropped two percentage points to 62%, while women respondents dropped from 51% approve to 44%.

The president’s approval among Latinos also dropped 9 points to 39%, and it dropped 4 points among independent voters to 32%.

Republicans showed a 2-point lead over Democrats ahead of the midterm elections, with 46% of respondents preferring a Republican-controlled Congress, compared to 44% who want Democrats to retain power, according to the poll.

Biden’s rating on the economy is also down 5 points, with only 33% saying they approve of the president’s performance on that issue, and 38% blame the president for rising inflation, which hit 7.9% in February.

Only 28% of respondents said they have either a ""great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of confidence in Biden’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, and a whopping 44% said they have ""very little"" confidence in the president.

President Biden said Thursday that a food shortage is ""gonna be real"" following the sanctions that were placed on Russia by the U.S. government as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion into Ukraine.

""With regard to food shortage, yes we did talk about food shortages, and it's gonna be real,"" Biden said during a press conference at a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, following a meeting with other world leaders.

""The price of the sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia,"" he added. ""It’s imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.""

Biden said ""Russia and Ukraine have been the breadbasket of Europe in terms of wheat"" and insisted that he and other leaders had a ""long discussion in the G7"" about the need to ""increase and disseminate"" food production.

""In addition to that, we talked about urging all the European countries, and everyone else, to end trade … limitations on sending food abroad,"" Biden said. ""And, so, we are in the process of working out with our European friends what it would take to help alleviate the concerns relative to the food shortages.""

Biden's warning of a ""real"" food shortage and the impact it will have on America and European countries following the implementation of sanctions on the Russian economy comes after White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week that Americans are unlikely to face a food shortage.

""While we're not expecting a food shortage here at home, we do anticipate that higher energy, fertilizer, wheat, and corn prices could impact the price of growing and purchasing critical fuel supply, food supplies for countries around the world,"" Psaki said. ""And early estimates from the World Bank suggest disproportionate impacts on low and middle-income countries including in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.""

At the time, Psaki said the administration was working ""with our partners in the G7, multilateral development banks, the World Food Programme, and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization to mitigate"" food shortage impacts lower-income countries.

RUSSIA'S UKRAINE WAR THREATENS TO BLOW US FOOD PRICES SKY-HIGH

A Twitter account managed by the Republican National Committee highlighted previous dismissal from Biden over potential food shortages in America due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2020, while taking aim at then-President Donald Trump during a virtual town hall, Biden claimed America did not have a food shortage problem.

""We don't have a food shortage problem — we have a leadership problem,"" then-candidate Biden said.

""We have plenty of food,"" Biden added at the time. ""It's being plowed under. You've got-- you're euthanizing cattle and pigs. They're out there making sure that they're pouring thousands of gallons of milk into the ground. It's not a food shortage. It's a lack of leadership-- a lack of leadership.""

As war continues to ravage Ukraine, Americans, particularly those who live paycheck to paycheck, are beginning to feel the financial squeeze on their food prices from the conflict half a world away.

It began with a rapid rise in gas prices . Now, with Russian oil banned in the United States and energy scarcity heightened globally, experts say shoppers can expect their grocery bills to rise in coming months – especially if Ukraine misses its wheat planting season.

""It comes an absolutely horrible time for American consumers because we're looking every day at inflation almost reaching 10%,"" Dan Varroney, a supply chain expert and founder of Potomac Core, told FOX Business. ""Last month's figures were close to 8%. And that means that consumers, including those that are living paycheck to paycheck, are going to pay more for food.""

Russia and Ukraine produce 25% of the global wheat supply, according to the Observatory for Economic Complexity. While neither of these countries export wheat to the U.S. directly, their absence from the global market is expected to strain supply and push prices higher.

508,"Russian oligarch, Ukraine peacekeepers suffer suspected poisoning after Kyiv meeting: Report",Danielle Wallace,"

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and at least two senior Ukrainian peacekeepers suffered symptoms from a suspected poisoning attack but have since recovered, according to a report published Monday.

Following a meeting in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv earlier this month, Abramovich and the two senior members of the Ukrainian peacekeeping team, including Crimean Tatar lawmaker Rustem Umerov and a second unnamed individual, began experiencing symptoms that included red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Citing unnamed sources familiar with the incident, the newspaper said it’s not clear who was responsible for the alleged attack, but the victims pointed to hardliners in Moscow trying to sabotage talks to end the war. Abramovich, Umerov and the third officials have since improved in condition and their lives are not in danger following the suspected poisoning, the sources said.

RUSSIA'S MINISTRY OF DEFENSE HEAD SERGEI SHOIGU REPORTEDLY MISSING, HASN'T MADE PUBLIC APPEARANCES IN 12 DAYS

The sources added that Western experts said it was difficult to determine whether the symptoms were caused by a chemical or biological agent or by some sort of electromagnetic-radiation attack.

It wouldn’t be the first time the Kremlin has been blamed for such an attack.

Christo Grozev, a member of the open-source collective Bellingcat, which determined that the Kremlin was behind a nerve agent attack on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020, told the Journal that the suspected attack on Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators ""was not intended to kill,"" describing the suspected poisoning incident as ""just a warning.""

prev Image 2 of 2

Grozev said he’s seen photos of the effects of the suspected poisoning, but a timely sample collection could not be organized in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv because the officials were in a hurry to travel to Istanbul, Turkey for additional talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials this week. Too much time had passed for the suspected poison to be detected before a German-based forensic team with the required expertise could arrive to perform an examination, he added.

When contacted by Fox News, Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied information about the suspected poisoning.

A source at the Ukrainian Defense Ministry also told Fox News that The Journal’s article was the first time they heard about the poisoning and ""Minister Reznikov feels good and is working.""

""All members of the negotiating team are working normally today,"" Podoliak also said Monday in reaction to the report about the suspected poisoning of Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators, according to Ukrainian media outlet, Novoye Vremya. ""In the information field there are now many information speculations, various conspiracy theories and elements of one or another information game. Therefore, I will repeat once again - members of negotiating groups work today in regular modes.""

In 2018, U.K. officials blamed the Russian intelligence services for a nerve agent attack against defected former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. They both survived, as did a British police officer hospitalized after exposure to the nerve agent. But a British woman accidentally exposed to the poison later died. The Kremlin denied any involvement in the incident.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly asked President Biden not to impose sanctions against Abramovich because he is involved in ongoing negotiations, shuttling between Moscow and Kyiv, Lyiv, Poland, Belarus and other locations for in-person talks since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Abramovich, who owns Chelsea soccer club, a minority stake in the steel company Evraz PLC and has Portuguese citizenship, has been sanctioned by the U.K. and the European Union.

During an interview with Russian journalists this weekend, which has since reportedly been barred from airing on Russian state-run TV stations, Zelenskyy said Abramovich was an initial member of a subcommittee of the Russian negotiating team who later became involved in humanitarian issues, such as civilian evacuations from the port city Mariupol, which has suffered heavy Russian bombardment.

509,Former Maine gubernatorial candidate and prominent Democrat donor arrested on child porn charges,Louis Casiano,"

A two-time Maine gubernatorial candidate, and prominent political figure and Democratic donor, was released from jail Saturday after making bail following his arrest last week on child porn possession charges.

Eliot Cutler, 75, was arrested by the Maine State Police on March 25 at his Brooklin home, a police spokesperson told Fox News. He is charged with four counts of possession of unlawful sexually explicit material of a minor under 12.

He was released on $50,000 bail and is scheduled to appear at a Hancock County court arraignment on May 3.

MORE STATES, CITIES LIFT MASK MANDATES, COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS AS CASES FALL

Warrants were executed on two of Cutler's homes earlier in the week. The counts correspond with crimes authorities said Cutler committed from December through March.

Fox News has reached out to his lawyer.

Cutler is an environmental lawyer who has long been involved in politics, working for Democratic Sen. Edmund Muskie and former President Jimmy Carter. He ran for governor as an independent in 2010 and 2014, using his personal wealth to fund the campaigns. Both elections were won by Republican Paul LePage.

The Maine GOP tweeted a list of Democrats Cutler has given donations to, including President Biden and former President Barack Obama. The party urged officials to give back the funds.

Cutler was viewed by many as a spoiler in his first run for governor, as some felt his bid helped elect LePage, WCSH-TV reported. Amid the allegations against him, he resigned from the board of the Lerner Foundation last week, foundation Executive Director, Don Carpenter, said on the group's website.

Former KGB agent, Jack Barsky, joined ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" to discuss his take on the assault and how the invasion has gone awry, according to Moscow.

""There is no way that Russian intelligence didn't know in great detail what Russia would be facing,"" Barsky told co-host Pete Hegseth.

""Either they were afraid to tell or they did tell, and Putin just dismissed,"" he continued. ""It could be a mixture of both because… Vladimir Putin has had a history… of knowing that he is the smartest man in the room and… just like ignoring advice from his people.""

Barsky also addressed how the U.S. has handled Russia and argued the foreign policy of the Obama administration particularly was naive in thinking it could play ""nice"" with Putin.

""We as a country, have not paid enough attention to what Putin has been planning for a long time,"" Barsky warned. ""He wants to establish greater Russia the way it once started and… he has been pretty open about it.""

""He has stated in public that he doesn't consider Ukraine a sovereign nation, and Ukraine and Russia should be united,"" he continued.

Paul’s office identified $52,598,515,585 what it sees as waste, including money spent on ""a study of pigeons gambling on slot machines, giving kids junk food, and telling citizens of Vietnam not to burn their trash,"" according to a statement.

His list reads like a menu with bulleted items next to their price tags. He posted about the $549 million on Afghanistan Air Force planes he said were later sold as scrap, the $2.4 trillion in the construction of buildings in Afghanistan that essentially went unused and the pigeons playing slot machines study that cost $465,339.

515,"Russia to redeploy Kyiv forces, not withdraw, US official says: LIVE UPDATES",Posted Michael Lee,"Blinken: US focused on what ‘Russia does’ more than what it says

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested Tuesday that the White House is taking a wait and see approach to Russia’s major announcement this morning that it is withdrawing its troops from some parts of Ukraine in hopes of reaching a deal to end the war.

“There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We are focused on the latter,” Blinken told reporters after meeting with Morocco’s foreign minister. “And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people and that continues as we speak. As a result of this aggression... fully half of the children in Ukraine have been displaced from their homes.”

Blinken said what Russia “should do is end the aggression now, stop firing, pull its forces back and of course engage in talks.”

“I can’t tell you whether these statements reflect some reorientation of the aggression to focus on 'only' eastern and southern Ukraine or whether this is a means by which Russia once again is trying to deflect and deceive people into thinking it’s not doing what it is doing,"" Blinken continued. ""Whether it’s simply trying to regroup given the heavy losses that it suffered -- I don’t know.”

But Blinken also said if Russia ""somehow believe that an effort to subjugate 'only' the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves.

""We have seen the will and the determination of the Ukrainian people to determine their own future, not to have Russia or anyone else determine it for them,"" Blinken said. ""And I think that will continue to be expressed one way or another in all parts of the country.""",https://www.foxnews.com

""Putin didn’t even know his military was using and losing conscripts in Ukraine, showing a clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information to the Russian President,"" the official said.

524,MSNBC host baffled that Biden's 'big wins' aren't translating into higher approval ratings,Brandon Gillespie,"

MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle admitted Monday she was stumped that President Biden's approval ratings weren't higher amid what she claimed were his ""big wins"" on a number of domestic and international issues.

During a segment on ""The 11th Hour,"" first reported on by NewsBusters, the liberal host noted Biden's tumbling approval rating in a new NBC News Poll, but sought ""to add a little context"" and ""bring in some facts"" about what the administration had been doing on several points on which voters felt it had performed poorly.

""The next headline sounds alarming. Quote, ‘Biden’s job approval falls to the lowest level of his presidency amid war and inflation fears.’ But let’s add a little context to those fears. Let’s bring in some facts,"" Ruhle said.

She went on to list what she felt were successes by the Biden administration while headlines from various, mostly liberal, outlets promoting the alleged accomplishments flashed on the screen.

MSNBC HOST THREATENS TO UNFOLLOW PEOPLE ON TWITTER WHO BUY NEW BILL BARR BOOK

""The United States is already sending billions in military and economic support to Ukraine, and there is every indication economic sanctions are strangling the Russian economy. Right now, NATO is as unified as it has ever been. And while inflation here at home is still a big problem, jobless rates are the lowest they have been in more than 50 years. And as the American people recover from Covid-19, so does our economy,"" Ruhle stated.

She admitted those factors weren't translating to American voters and cited the NBC Poll showing Biden's approval rating at 40%, a new low, with 55% disapproving. The poll also showed only 28% of respondents had ""a great deal, or quite a bit of,"" confidence in Biden's handling of the situation in Ukraine, with 71% having ""just some"" or ""very little.""

Ruhle was joined by NBC News correspondent Yamiche Alcindor and MSNBC political analyst Charlie Sykes and she asked them why Biden was facing such poor poll numbers.

MSNBC ANCHOR DUBBED ‘STEPHANIE ANTOINETTE’ SINGS DIFFERENT TUNE ON INFLATION: BIGGER PAYCHECKS ‘MEANINGLESS’

""I just ran down some significant hard evidence positives that we're experiencing and Biden can tell. Why isn’t he reaping the benefits in the polls? These are big wins,"" Ruhle said.

Sykes argued that voters were focused on other issues, like border security, crime and inflation, and that the Biden administration has suffered from ""muddled messaging.""

""Look, you and I can go on for some time with the facts, and we could also observe the Republicans are losing their minds, and behaving in extreme ways,"" said Sykes. ""But, right now, the Democrats are in charge. And at some point, I do think that Joe Biden has to come up with some sort of a reset. Find a way to connect to the American people in a way that he hasn't, use the bully pulpit more effectively.""

Ruhle questioned the need for ""a reset"" and again cited Biden's handling of Ukraine and the economy, as well as the massive infrastructure bill he signed into law in 2021.

Sykes responded, ""He's not getting credit for these things. I mean, that's part of the problem. Politics is about perception as well as reality and Joe Biden has not connected himself with a lot of that.

""The Democrats spent a lot of last year fighting with one another, and talking about whether their agenda was being derailed. So, as a result, there’s not that wind at his back, where he is the leading figure behind the economic recovery, behind the end of the pandemic. He needs to take credit for what he is doing to talk about that. But he needs to do it clearer.""

Alcindor closed out the discussion, echoing Sykes and arguing the Democrat Party needs to rally around the president and ""double down"" on his messaging.

According to Alcindor, Democratic pollsters say, ""[T]this really comes down to the Democratic Party rallying around the president and really echoing some of the things that the president has been saying…

""Let's remember, that the White House has been saying that this is Putin's price hike. That was the words that they were using, and Democrats in some ways, based on my reporting and talking to Democrats, they're sort of frustrated with the situation, they say that the party needs to double down on that.""",https://www.foxnews.com
525,Florida FreeFall tragedy: Woman accused of posing as dead teen's cousin,Adam Sabes,"

A woman claiming to be the cousin of the 14-year-old who died after falling off of a ride at an Orlando, Florida amusement park says that the teenager was denied entrance to two of the other rides because of his weight. However, the teen's family says they don't know the woman and that she is not a cousin.

Tyre Sampson, 14, died after falling off of the Orlando FreeFall ride at ICON Park on March 24. The ride is 430-feet-tall, according to the attraction.

Shay Johnson, while falsely claiming to be Sampson's cousin, told Spectrum News 13 at a candlelight vigil on Monday that the teenager was stopped from riding two other rides in the amusement park because of his weight.

""[Tyre] said ‘I want to get on the swing on International,' I said ‘Okay, ride it twice and ride it for me, too.’ And he called me back about seven minutes later, he said, ‘They said I’m too big, I can't ride,"" Johnson said.

One of ICON Park's rides is called the ""Orlando StarFlyer,"" which is described as the ""World’s Tallest Stand-Alone Swing Ride,"" at 450-feet-tall.

""ICON Park formally notified the owner of the Orlando FreeFall, the SlingShot Group, demanding suspension not only of the operation of Orlando FreeFall but also the operation of Orlando SlingShot, effective immediately, until the attractions are proven to be safe by authorities,"" a statement on ICON Park's website reads.

An operating manual for the Orlando FreeFall states that the maximum passenger weight is just over 286 pounds. Sampson was 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighed 330 pounds, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The Orlando SlingShot, which passed initial inspections from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, opened in late December 2021.

The boy's father told FOX 35 Orlando that Tyre was feeling uncomfortable when the ride began.

""When the ride took off, that's when he was feeling uncomfortable. He was like, ‘This thing is moving.’ … That's when he started freaking out,"" Yarnell Sampson, told FOX 35 Orlando . ""He was explaining to his friends next to him … ‘If I don’t make it down … please tell my mom and dad I love them.' For him to say something like that, he must've felt something.""

""We got a little closer and it was a person laying on the ground,"" Montrey Williams said. ""Everyone was just panicking and screaming.""

911 calls released by authorities on Monday show that one caller claimed that Sampson's seatbelt was not secured properly.

""Okay, so was he up off the ground?,"" the 911 dispatcher asked.

""No, they didn't secure the seatbelt on him,"" the 911 caller said.

""I am humbled by this unique opportunity to speak directly to FOX News Media’s millions of viewers about a range of issues that are important to the American people,"" Jenner said.

Jenner has been in the public eye for decades, becoming a household name during the 1976 Summer Olympic Games in Montreal by capturing the gold medal and setting a world record in the decathlon. Jenner, then known as Bruce, came out as transgender and began publicly identifying as a female in 2015.

That same year, Jenner revealed her new name with a Vanity Fair cover captioned, ""Call Me Caitlyn.""

She has since emerged as arguably the most influential transgender woman in the world, although her ties to the GOP have often irked other members of the LGBTQ+ community. Jenner has previously said she faced more backlash admitting she was a Republican than she did when she publicly joined the transgender community.

She has since established The Caitlyn Jenner Foundation, which aims to promote equality and combat discrimination by providing grants to organizations that improve the lives of transgender people. The foundation also helps anti-bullying, suicide prevention, healthcare, housing, employment and other related programs.

528,"WI school district says parents 'not entitled' to know child's sexuality, pushes 'heterosexual privilege' list",Timothy Nerozzi,"

A school district in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, has become the center of a parent-teacher firestorm after leaked documents revealed instructors told parents they must ""earn"" the right to know their children's sexual identity, and showed the school pushed a ""heterosexual privilege"" checklist.

The district's aggressive push for ""gender-nonconforming"" accommodations has irked parents and educators who say the school's training and policy changes surrounding the issue have gone too far.

""The actions of the Eau Claire Area School District are not only dangerous to the mental, emotional and physical health of its students, but they also violate the constitutional rights of parents to make choices about their family life and upbringing of their children,"" said Ian Prior, senior adviser at America First Legal and creator of the Fight for Schools PAC.

WOMEN'S ADVOCACY GROUPS SILENT ON TRANSGENDER SWIMMER LIA THOMAS' DOMINATION AT NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS

Of particular scorn in the district's guidance was a slide stating, ""Some transgender, non-binary, and/or gender-nonconforming students are not 'open' at home for reasons that may include safety concerns or lack of acceptance. School personnel should speak with the student first before discussing a student’s gender nonconformity or transgender status with the student’s parent/guardian.""

Groups of parents expressed outrage at the notion they had to earn access to their children's information.

""Remember, parents are not entitled to know their kids' identities. That knowledge must be earned,"" a training slideshow for the Eau Claire School District told school staff.

""Parents in Eau Claire need to use every legal means to fight back, including requests for documents under the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Act, requests for access to curriculum and teacher training materials under the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment, and litigation to protect their constitutional rights,"" Prior added.

Eau Claire Area School District (ECASD) responded to a Fox News Digital request for comment, clarifying their motivations and future plans for the LGBTQ support programs.

""In the Eau Claire Area School District, we have a responsibility to meet the needs of all students. As part of this work, district staff received training on February 25 focused on creating Eau Claire Area School District told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""Data shows that students who identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community experience mental health challenges and feel isolated at a much higher rate than their peers. For example, based on results from the most recent Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction Youth Risk Behavior Survey of high school students, 87% of LGBTQIA+ students report mental health concerns and just 44% say they feel a sense of belonging. This is compared to 46% and 68%, respectively, for non-LGBTQIA+ students.""

Among the guidelines presented to school staff for support of ""gender-nonconforming"" youth is a clause that states students have a right to use any gendered facility that corresponds to their identity. This includes bathrooms and changing rooms with members of the biologically opposite sex.

""Schools maintain separate restrooms and locker rooms for male and female students (i.e. sex assigned at birth). Access should be allowed based on the gender identity (i.e., man, woman, trans, non-binary, etc.) expressed by the student,"" the guidelines reviewed by Fox News Digital state.

""Any student who is uncomfortable using a shared restroom or locker room regardless of the reason, shall upon request, be provided with an alternative. This may include, for example, addition of a privacy partition or curtain, use of a nearby private restroom or office, or a separate changing schedule. However, staff should not require a transgender or gender-nonconforming student/employee to use a separate, nonintegrated space unless requested by the individual student,"" an ECASD document reads.

Speaking on the controversial guidelines, Eau Claire Area School District told Fox News Digital: ""Our staff often find themselves in positions of trust with our students. The professional development presentation in question shared extensive data and information to assist our staff as they strive to create safe and supportive learning environments for their students. In fact, our efforts to ensure students feel safe and welcome in our schools is a big point of pride for the ECASD.""

There has also been opposition to the district's ""heterosexual privilege"" checklist, which includes such assertions as ""My sexual orientation was never associated with a closet,"" ""I can kiss a person of the opposite gender without being watched and stared at,"" ""I'm not grouped because of my sexual orientation,"" and ""I can remain oblivious of the language and culture of LGBT folk without feeling in my culture any penalty for such oblivion.""

The checklist, obtained by Fox News Digital, went on to assert that these statements were evidence of a sexuality-based social privilege that should be acknowledged by students and staff.

""These dynamics are but a few examples of the privilege afforded to heterosexual people. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer-identified folk have a range of different experiences, but cannot count on most of these conditions in their lives,"" reads a conclusion at the end of the checklist.

Trainings at the ECASD have become so political that a teacher penned a letter to the school board announcing their intention to find work in another district, writing, ""To say that I am upset about all of this would be an understatement. For you to understand the gravity of how I feel, I will let you know that I am actively looking for a job elsewhere.""

""When one person yesterday slightly spoke about the fact that this isn't ‘their truth,’ more than one person had an extremely condescending response to it,"" the email, obtained by Fox News Digital, continued. ""How are we supposed to provide a ‘safe space’ for our students, when the adults in the building can't even be open to the fact that other people don't feel the exact same way they do? What about diversity of opinion?""

The educator, who remains anonymous, stressed that of particular offense was the district's attitude toward religion and Christianity, saying such spiritual beliefs were cast in a ""negative light"" and ignored or derided.

""We acknowledge this is difficult work that requires our engagement and focus. However, we will remain steadfast in our efforts to meet the needs of all the students we serve,"" Eau Claire Area School District concluded in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""As a district, we are continually evaluating and updating our professional development. We also work with our parents every day and welcome their engagement in the work of the ECASD. If parents have questions or concerns, we encourage them to contact their child’s teacher, school principal or the district office.""",https://www.foxnews.com
529,"Biden administration endorses transgender youth sex-change operations, 'top surgery,' hormone therapy",Timothy Nerozzi,"

The same day, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Child Traumatic Stress Network – another subset of the HHS – released a parallel document titled, ""Gender-Affirming Care Is Trauma-Informed Care.""

""Medical and psychosocial gender affirming healthcare practices have been demonstrated to yield lower rates of adverse mental health outcomes, build self-esteem, and improve overall quality of life for transgender and gender diverse youth,"" the OPA release states.

The NCTSN document is far longer than the brief outline provided by the OPA, but reiterates the same thought process and explanation for minors receiving alterations to their genitalia.

OKLAHOMA GOVERNOR SIGNS TRANSGENDER SPORTS BAN INTO LAW

""For transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, early gender-affirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being as it allows the child or adolescent to focus on social transitions and can increase their confidence while navigating the healthcare system,"" the NCTSN wrote in their release. ""It may include evidence-based interventions such as puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones.""

The NCTSN document goes out of its way to assure the public that the use of gender-affirming methods such as surgery and hormone replacement are not child abuse – most likely in response to recent policy decision in Texas that made such treatments illegal.

""Providing gender-affirming care is neither child maltreatment nor malpractice. The child welfare system in the US, charged with ""improv(ing) the overall health and well-being of our nation’s children and families,"" should not be used to deny care or separate families working to make the best decisions for their children’s well-being. There is no scientifically sound research showing negative impacts from providing gender-affirming care,"" the NCTSN added.

The White House released a video to coincide with the new policies featuring President Biden speaking on the issue of transgender children.

Biden told the parents of transgender children that ""affirming your child's identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe.""

Gov. Greg Abbott has called gender-affirming treatments "" child abuse "" and ordered Texas Child Protective Services to investigate any reported cases. Attorney General Ken Paxton also issued a legal opinion coming to the same conclusion, according to Houston Public Media.

A video posted online, which has since gone viral, shows a man sitting dazed on the ground moments before another man runs up from behind and kicks him flush in the face, knocking him out. The victim appeared to be knocked unconscious as bystanders came to his aid.

One witness called police to report up to 10 people ""beating the guy,"" police said Monday. Someone off-camera can be heard accusing the man of trying to run over protesters.

The suspected attacker who kicked the man has not been publically identified by the Portland Police Bureau. The Portland Police Department told Fox News that the investigation is ongoing and the victim is recovering.

Portland police Chief Chuck Lovell said detectives are investigating the attack and requested assistance from the public via Twitter.

""PPB Assault Detectives are actively investigating this alarming incident that resulted in a man being hospitalized,"" the chief wrote. ""If anyone has information about this event please reach out. Public safety is up to all of us.""

Information from a Facebook account believed to belong to the suspected attacker indicated he works at Portland International Airport. An airport spokeswoman told Fox News that person has not worked there since 2016.

Violence erupted Sunday as protests got underway in what has become a nightly occurrence. Mobs of protesters have attacked random bystanders and dished out beatings for no reason, Hernandez said.

""It's literally like just one thing after another, he said. ""Just these random people, they start physically assaulting.""

He said the man seen in the video was near a convenience store away from the protest when the attack occurred. He was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and is recovering, police said Monday in a news release.

In the video, a person can be heard off-camera accusing the driver of trying to run over protesters.

The attack comes as Portland continues to grapple with nights of unrest that have increasingly turned violent, leading to shootings, assaults, arson and the hurling of deadly objects at police officers.

On Wednesday, Austin announced a 60-day ""stand down"" and ordered military leaders to have ""needed discussions with the men and women of the force"" in an effort to weed out extremism in the ranks.

PENTAGON ORDERS 'STAND DOWN' ACROSS MILITARY TO INVESTIGATE EXTREMISM IN RANKS

""One thing is for sure,"" Ingraham reacted. ""If this is substantive and not symbolic, it will do grave damage to our military preparedness and morale. Our men and women in uniform have been asked to sacrifice -- multiple tours, many of them -- for so long. Oftentimes, in ridiculous engagements, idiotic wars.

""Now the Biden administration rewards them by casting them as potential domestic terrorists? Ticking time bombs of White supremacy? You can always count on think-tank generals whose salaries are funded by rich donors to side with the Democrats on the issue like this.""

""If Democrats were seriously concerned about stamping out extremism, they'd be looking in the mirror,"" Ingraham added. ""How many wacky, incendiary, inflammatory, defamatory hateful things have been said by their members over the past five years, or just over the past month?""

The host concluded by issuing a challenge to Republicans like House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.

534,Disney employee issues dire warning about the economic consequences of new 'leftward lurch',Tyler O'Neil,"

Jose Castillo, a current Walt Disney Company employee who is running for Congress in Florida as a Republican, told Fox News Digital that Disney's new political activism may come back to bite the company… in its pocketbook.

Florida legislators have floated the idea of repealing the 1967 Reedy Creek Improvement Act, which gives Disney the autonomy to effectively run its own government in the area around Disney World, in response to the company's recent advocacy against the parental rights law H.B. 1557 , which critics have branded the ""Don't Say Gay"" law. Repealing the law would subject Disney World to the government of Orange County.

DESANTIS BROACHES REPEAL OF DISNEY WORLD'S SPECIAL SELF-GOVERNING STATUS IN FLORIDA

Castillo warned that, if Disney's advocacy against the law spurs this repeal, it will hurt the company's bottom-line, especially if the company continues left-wing advocacy.

""I think that if Disney is going to continue this leftward lurch, and the legislature votes to give Disney the left-leaning policies that they’ve asked for, then they’ll be subject to the tyrannical rule of the mayor of Orange County, which they will soon regret,"" Castillo told Fox News Digital. ""If Disney falls under Orange County regulations and taxes, I suspect they’ll think twice before pushing for more of them.""

Castillo declined to comment on whether he supports the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, but he did say that as a ""free market capitalist,"" he opposes ""the government giving special advantages to certain companies and individuals. It’s not the government’s job to pick winners and losers.""

""It is also probably in part because of these privileges and the considerable sway that Disney has in Florida that creates the impetus for them to weigh in on issues such as the Parental Rights in Education Bill,"" he added.

""It bothers me when I read public statements saying things like ‘we’ believe the bill shouldn’t have been passed,"" the employee added. ""I’ve been with Disney for 13 years and am proud of my role in the company. When the company uses words like ‘we’ it should mean all of the Cast Members, and right now, that’s not the case.""

‘SILENT MAJORITY’ OF DISNEY EMPLOYEES SUPPORT FLORIDA LAW, DISNEY EMPLOYEE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS SAYS

Castillo previously told Fox News Digital that a ""silent majority"" of Disney employees support the law, even the the company has taken a public stance against it after LGBTQ employees protested.

Despite critics branding it a ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, H.B. 1557 does not ban the word ""gay"" in school settings. Neither does it ban casual discussions of topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. It does not require schools to notify parents if their child identifies as gay or transgender.

""Conservative Disney cast members are afraid to speak out because of the company’s very public stance opposing the Parental Rights in Education bill,"" he said. ""I think that’s a grave miscalculation on Disney’s part because the vocal minority doesn’t speak for the majority of cast members or the majority of Florida parents who don’t want their young children to be taught about sexuality by public school teachers.""

536,House votes to decriminalize marijuana at federal level,Timothy Nerozzi,"

The U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday to decriminalize possession of marijuana on the federal level.

The House heard a slew of proposed amendments for the bill, including measures to track and prevent impaired driving under the influence of marijuana, as well as carve-outs for law enforcement to restructure around the decriminalized substance.

The bill passed with a vote of 220 to 204.

Three Republicans voted yes: Matt Gaetz of Florida, Tom McClintock of California and Brian Mast of Florida. Two Democrats voted no: Chris Pappas of New Hampshire and Henry Cuellar of Texas.

FLORIDA WARNS OF NEW DRUG MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN FENTANYL

Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Ore., spoke against the bill on the basis of possible spikes in impaired driving without first providing the research into the possible ramifications of the decriminalization. Bentz stated that the relevant data should be provided before the bill is passed.

""It's been obvious for years that at some point marijuana was going to be formally legalized,"" Bentz said on the floor.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), marijuana is the most commonly used federally illegal drug in the U.S.

The agency said 48.2 million people, or about 18% of Americans, used it at least once in 2019.

Bentz continued, ""What's deeply and truly disturbing, however, about this bill is its failure to address the clear consequences of legalization, such as what this drug does to children, to drivers on our highways, to the mental health of up to 30 percent of those adults who choose to use marijuana to communities inundated with hundreds, if not thousands of foreign cartel operated, unlicensed out of control marijuana grows.""

Bentz disagreed with Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., who spoke in favor of the decriminalization bill. Lamb cited his time as an assistant attorney general in Pittsburgh.

""Before I came to Congress, I was a federal prosecutor in my hometown of Pittsburgh. And the biggest law enforcement challenges that we had then and really still have today are opioids and gun violence,"" said Lamb.

""Marijuana just didn't register in terms of the risk that it posed to people on a day to day basis compared to those two things.,"" Lamb continued. ""Yet because of the way the federal criminal laws are written in the way that cannabis is placed in schedule one, it is very easy for a marijuana offense to actually get someone a worse sentence than an opioid offense like overprescribing OxyContin or selling fentanyl or a firearms.""

Rep. Jim Jordan voiced outrage at the marijuana bill's timing, saying that issues such as crime, inflation, and illegal immigration should be taking precedence.

""Record crime, record inflation, record gas prices, record number of illegal immigrants crossing our southern border. And what are Democrats doing today?"" Jordan asked on the floor. ""Legalizing drugs, legalizing drugs and using American tax dollars to kick-start and prop up the marijuana industry. Wow. Such a deal for the American people.""

Marijuana legalization has become a popular campaign for political candidates across the aisles in recent years.

In 2020, the topic found renewed interest after U.S. Olympic champion Sha’Carri Richardson was told she would not run in the 100-meter race after she tested positive for THC, a chemical found in marijuana, at the Olympic trials – voiding her first-place results.

The House of Representatives voted 228-164 to pass the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act in 2020, the first time either chamber of Congress has ever voted to decriminalize marijuana.

However, the legislation stalled going to the Senate, and eventually died without going any farther.

537,"Biden admin moves to end Trump-era 'Remain in Mexico,' admits it 'likely' helped reduce illegal migration",Adam Shaw,"

The Biden administration on Friday moved again to end the Trump-era ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, even as it is reimplementing it in response to a court order — and admitted that it ""likely"" contributed to reduced illegal migration at the southern border.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a memo that the benefits of the program, officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) ""are far outweighed by the costs of continuing to use the program on a programmatic basis, in whatever form"" and that he is terminating the program.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS GATHERING ON SOUTHERN BORDER AHEAD OF REMAIN-IN-MEXICO RESTART, SOURCES SAY

The policy, officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols, was set up and expanded in 2019 and saw migrants sent back to Mexico as they awaited their hearings. It was the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s efforts to end the practice of ""catch-and-release"" by which migrants were released into the interior after being apprehended.

Proponents said it was a dramatically effective program that both kept illegal immigrants out of the country and reduced the ""pull factors"" drawing migrants north. Critics said it was a cruel policy that resulted in migrants camping in squalid conditions and being put at risk of kidnapping and violence.

The Biden administration began unraveling the program earlier this year and officially ended it in June. But a federal court order ordered it to be reinstated after Texas and Missouri sued, claiming that the administration had not conducted a required analysis of the policy before scrapping it.

In the memo, Mayorkas said that while it is still complying with the court order, he has conducted an analysis on whether the program should be kept, modified, or abandoned -- as well as claims that the court said were not sufficiently addressed, like the program’s effect on border crossings.

He says in the memo that he has determined that MPP ""should be terminated,"" even as he accepted that it reduced border crossings

""In reaching this conclusion, I recognize that MPP likely contributed to reduced migratory flows. But it did so by imposing substantial and unjustifiable human costs on the individuals who were exposed to harm while waiting in Mexico,"" he said.

DHS SAYS IT ANTICIPATES RESTARTING TRUMP-ERA REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY IN NOVEMBER, IS REBUILDING TENT COURTS

He said that the administration is instead pursuing policies ""that disincentivize irregular migration while incentivizing safe, orderly and humane pathways"" and claimed that those policies ""once fully implemented...will address migratory flows as effectively, in fact more effectively, while holding to our nation’s values.""

He concludes the memo by saying that DHS will continue complying with the court injunction to reimplement MPP, but that the termination of the program will be implemented ""as soon as practicable after a final judicial decision to vacate the Texas injunction.""

The memo comes as the Biden administration is still enveloped in a massive border crisis that has overwhelmed authorities at the border and caused a significant political headache for the new administration.

There were more than 192,000 migrant encounters in September, taking the total for FY 2021 over the 1.7 million mark. Republicans have blamed the Biden rollback of a number of Trump-era policies, but the Biden administration has instead blamed ""root causes"" like poverty and violence in Central America.",https://www.foxnews.com
538,Woke Disney: 10 families who are swearing off Disney due to its left-leaning politics,Maureen Mackey,"

Some families across the country are reconsidering their previously Disney-friendly stance in their homes or their lives — including the movies, the streaming service, the theme parks and other offerings from the entertainment and media conglomerate.

That's partly because Disney's CEO, Bob Chapek, has opposed a new bill signed into law this week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; it's known as the Parental Rights in Education bill.

PARENTS OUTRAGED OVER DISNEY'S PUSHBACK ON FLORIDA'S PARENTAL RIGHTS LAW

The law prohibits Florida teachers from instructing very young students — those in kindergarten through third grade — about gender identity and sexual orientation. Initially, Chapek had not taken a public stance on it, but some people believe he ultimately caved to a minority of far-left ""wokers"" who are upset about the new law.

Here's a tweet from the Disney company that went out this week:

But it's not just this. Disney World and Disneyland have decided to ban the use of ""gender greetings"" within their parks — so the terms ""boys and girls"" and ""ladies and gentlemen"" will no longer be uttered by employees on Disney grounds.

These instances and more of left-leaning policies are why some concerned parents, grandparents and others have changed or are revising their views of Disney. Here are opinions and insights from a variety of individuals, as shared with Fox News Digital this week in exclusive interviews.

'This isn't your grandmother's Disney'

Patti Garibay, an Ohio-based parent and grandparent, is executive director and founder of American Heritage Girls, a faith-focused alternative to the Girl Scouts. She told Fox News Digital this week via email, ""It is time to void your household of all things Disney.""

She explained, ""Walt Disney most often cited his most important lesson as that of ‘goodwill always triumphs over evil.’ Today's Disney promotes a full spectrum of lifestyles that rarely align with the biblical values of good and evil, which God calls us to.""

She continued, ""It has been said before and it bears saying again, ‘Walt would turn over in his grave’ to see what his beloved company has become.""

""It is time to void your household of all things Disney.""

Added Garibay, ""It's no longer a safe haven for families to promote good over evil, but rather an environment without a moral compass.""

Garibay also said, ""Christians should wake up to the fact that this isn't your grandmother's Disney. In fact,"" she said, ""Disney is now devoted to confusing your children.""

Disney will 'lose on this wokeness gamble'

A Tennessee father of a 10-month-old daughter told Fox News Digital, ""As a new father, I have decided not to expose my baby to any of Disney's products — anything they stream, or the theme parks. There are so many other wholesome options for her.""

He also said that, in time, ""I will let her watch the older Disney films on DVD that I was raised on — they taught values that kids need and can understand, things like loyalty, friendship, working through obstacles, and the love of family.""

He added, ""Disney doesn't seem to understand that parents have so many options now. Ultimately, I think they're going to lose on this wokeness gamble.""

‘You can't promote innocence and sex at the same time'

A mother and grandmother in her early 60s who lives outside Boston, Mass., told Fox News Digital in an email on Thursday, ""I gave up on Disney years ago when they started opening the parks up for gay pride activities while families were there.""

I'M A MOM AND I'M SAYING GOODBYE TO DISNEY

She added, ""A children's theme park is no place for this. You can't promote both innocence and sex at the same time. This was a clear signal to families about where they are headed as a company.""

She also noted, ""As a Christian grandmother, my job is to protect, guide and love."" She said that ""participating in anything Disney forces me to abandon all three.""

‘Parents are deeply frustrated’

Kelly Claggett, a mother and owner of The Local Farm to Table & Venue in Grove, Oklahoma, shared with Fox News Digital, ""Parents are deeply frustrated because we have to fight so hard to raise our kids with important values like honesty, integrity and learning the Golden Rule.""

""The executives at Disney [must] live in some kind of bubble and don't know everyday moms and dads like us.""

She also said, ""Disney used to offer us wonderful content that reinforced good values. When I read about ‘woke Disney,’ my friends and I all felt the same way — clearly the executives at Disney live in some kind of bubble and don't know everyday moms and dads like us.""

DISNEY EXPANDING OPERATIONS TO 10 ANTI-GAY COUNTRIES, REGIONS, AS THEY GO ‘WOKE’ IN THE US

She said that, as a result, ""They are losing our families' business and that of almost everyone I know."" Claggett said her family ""is actively looking for and watching alternatives like ‘The Tuttle Twins’ that fill in where Disney is leaving off.""

‘They’ve tarnished their brand'

A New Jersey-based wife, sister and aunt who has long loved watching Disney films and visiting Disney theme parks said, ""For conservatives who are longtime Disney fans, the company's sharp left turn presents a real conundrum.""

""We are done and will not be funding that [Disney] machine any longer.""

She added, ""Do I love Disney films, stories and art? Yes. Do I love the theme parks? Absolutely. To me, the theme parks drip with creativity and story, and as a creative person, I gravitate to that.""

She admitted that for her, ""some of this probably comes down to pure nostalgia.""

However, she added, ""Do I love their politics? No! They've tarnished their brand with their most recent political activism targeting Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act — a bill most Americans support.""

Yet she still wishes for the best. ""My hope,"" she said, ""is that the company comes to its senses, remembers who their customers are and gets back to doing what they do best: Entertain ‘dreamers of all ages.’""

‘Our children are going through enough’

A mom of a young daughter in the Virginia Beach area of the Old Dominion State shared that her husband — a military man — was against Disney and its products and services even before she was.

""He said, ‘Absolutely not,’ about anything Disney-related even before this garbage came out,"" the mom said.

""I think that was the last straw for me as well with Disney,"" she continued. ""Our children are going through enough. They don't need the woke culture to destroy their innocence.""

She added, ""We are done and will not be funding that [Disney] machine any longer. I am also going to be disconnecting Disney+ in our household.""

Disney's woke content 'isn't the first and won't be the last challenge that Christian parents face'

""As a Christian father of three,"" said James Spencer, PhD, president of the D.L. Moody Center in Northfield, Mass., ""I am always concerned that my children may be seeing, hearing, and believing stories that will lead them away from Christ and distract them from proclaiming the gospel.""

""Let’s show our kids what it means to hold our convictions in the midst of a fallen world.""

He added, ""While I’ve not gone so far as to ban television in our home, I do spend time talking with my kids about what they are reading and viewing, so that they don’t begin to trust Disney, Paramount, Netflix, or Hulu more than they trust the Scriptures.""

DISNEY EMPLOYEE'S DIRE WARNING ABOUT CONSEQUENCES OF ‘LEFTWARD LURCH’

""Disney’s ‘woke’ content may pose a new challenge,"" he also said, ""but it isn’t the first and won’t be the last challenge that Christian parents face.""

He advised the following: ""Christians would do well to come together to tell an alternative story centered on the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ. Disney may be contributing to a new story that denies and diminishes God — but they aren’t the first to contribute, nor will they be the last.""

He also said, ""As we consider how to cultivate a vibrant faith in Jesus in the next generation of the church, we must remember that the Christian faith is not something we simply know, but something we live out. Let’s show our kids what it means to hold our convictions in the midst of a fallen world while proclaiming the love of Jesus in word and in deed.""

‘Going to Disney is something I'll never do again'

A father of two in the New York City area — and the son of a U.S. Army veteran — has taken his kids to Disney World in Orlando a few times in the past.

He said this week, ""I think placating a small subset of the loudest [Disney] employees who obviously haven't even read the Florida bill sets a really dangerous standard. But it's the same standard,"" he added, ""that we've seen from progressives over the last 20-30 years. In this scenario, the loudest, squeakiest, most annoying wheel gets the grease.""

This father also said, ""The fact that some higher ranking Disney employees are openly saying they're going to make sure that at least 50% of the characters are LGBTQIA — when that subset of our society is less than 10%, and probably less than 5% — means that I'll make sure I watch every single thing fully before my kids watch it, or I'll just do away with Disney as an entity to save myself time.""

""Who would have ever thought that Mickey would turn politically correct? But apparently he has, with a vengeance.""

He added, ""Between this and the stupid prices for worsening experiences at their parks, the traditional family ‘plan’ of going to Disney is something I'll never do again.""

This father also said bluntly, ""It's a shame, because my son — who's in kindergarten this year — wanted to go. But it's not worth the money, much less so if Disney's DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] initiatives mean I'll have to deal with Disney ‘princesses’ who have penises.""

Mickey Mouse ‘turned politically correct with a vengeance’

Judge Phil Ginn is a father of four daughters and president of Southern Evangelical Seminary (SES) in Charlotte, N.C. He told Fox News Digital in an email, ""Who would have ever thought that Mickey would turn politically correct? But apparently he has, with a vengeance.""

""They've chosen to engage in the destruction of the childhood of those they seek to entertain.""

He added, ""What is really sad, though, is that instead of focusing on real atrocities such as what is happening in the kingdom of Disney’s ‘blood brother,’ the Chinese Communist Party, they have chosen to engage in the destruction of the childhood of those they seek to entertain.""

Ginn said that Disney's ""destructive notions of hedonistic concepts of sexuality would make even Uncle Walt blush.""

""Maybe it’s time,"" he added, ""for true Christians to break some bad habits about how we spend our money for entertainment — and speak out against the creeping evil in our culture not only with our words, but our pocketbooks as well.""

Kids need 'a refuge from this crazy culture'

Trent Talbot, a father of two in Houston, Texas, is founder and CEO of BRAVE Books, as well as the author of ""The Fight for Freedom Island.""

He told Fox News Digital, ""Disney has surrendered to the woke mob and is using its platform to indoctrinate the children of America into becoming the woke activists of tomorrow.""

DISNEY ‘WAGING AN ATTACK ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY,’ SAYS REP. JIM BANKS

He added, ""Kids need entertainment that is a refuge from this crazy culture, where they can be entertained with just great stories and fun characters. And parents should have confidence that their children are seeing and hearing stories that are good and true.""

539,PCB Mayor: Same criminals behind Miami spring break crime now targeting Panama City Beach,Rebekah Castor,"

It's known as the spring break capital of the world. But this year, Panama City Beach is a target for criminals.

The city had a dangerous weekend with police seizing 75 guns and arresting more than 160 people.

The weekend violence has locals and visitors on edge. It's not typical spring breakers — high schoolers and college students enjoying the beach — causing problems. It's bold criminals who came to the city with bad intentions.

FLORIDA'S PANAMA CITY BEACH SPRING BREAK REVELERS PROMPT POLICE STREET CLOSURES, REPORT SAYS

""Our police chief said it best — the last book most of these folks read was ‘Cat in the Hat,’"" said Panama City Beach Mayor Mark Sheldon.

Over the last seven years, Panama City Beach has worked hard to distance itself from its ""Girls Gone Wild"" days and now advertises itself as a ""family friendly"" spring break destination.

In 2016, the city passed ordinances for the month of March, banning alcohol on the beach and ending alcohol sales past 2 a.m., to encourage revelers to go elsewhere. For the most part, it's worked to deter crime. But last weekend was different.

""Taking 75 guns off the street in a weekend in Panama City Beach is unheard of,"" Sheldon said. ""This was not spring break in any way, shape or form.""

After weeks of violence in Miami, city officials believe those bad actors have traveled to Florida's panhandle.

""Some of these same criminals who came to our county this weekend were in Miami last weekend; we know the exact people,"" Sheldon said. ""These criminals are traveling from town to town, so it's nobody new. It's just a bad group of folks who are trying to be lawless in every community they can find.

MIAMI BEACH VIOLENCE DRIVEN BY GUN-TOTING SPRING BREAKERS COMING IN BY CAR

The gunfire on Sunday left one person injured, shocking many in the community.

""It was unbelievable what happened,"" said Rafael Wanderbrock, food & beverage director for Barefoot Restaurants. ""Definitely those people didn't come here to vacation or have fun.""

Spring breaker Mary McGee from the University of North Alabama feels like her vacation is under attack.

""I don't see why you would plot something here,"" McGee said. ""We're just here to have fun. We're not trying to be a part of any of that.""

Just 20 minutes down the road from PCB, you'll find the smaller beach towns, such as Seaside and Rosemary Beach, known locally as 30A. The area is known for its quaint, oceanfront communities frequented by several country music stars like Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean and Garth Brooks.

Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson says his deputies are prepared if the violence spills over into the family-friendly communities.

""This is an extremely safe place to be, but for those individuals who are considering another kind of lifestyle, who are looking to come here and make this a ‘takeover destination,' we're going to take that with a strong hand.""

Adkinson says deputies will not be issuing any warnings or notices to appear. Those that break the law will go to jail and see a judge.

And for the criminals who fled Panama City over the weekend, Mayor Sheldon says they have not escaped the law.

MIAMI BEACH STREETS QUIET AS CURFEW GOES INTO EFFECT FOLLOWING SPRING BREAK VIOLENCE

""If they think just because they made it home that the crime is over, it's not,"" Sheldon said. ""Our detectives are working nonstop to comb through every bit of video, and they're going to get a knock at their door, and they will go to jail in Bay County.""

Unlike Miami, Panama City Beach has not yet had to initiate a curfew. Sheldon says nothing is off the table, and the city will take every measure necessary if things get out of hand again.",https://www.foxnews.com

One of the three women kidnapped and held captive in a Cleveland “House of Horrors” -- where she was raped daily for more than a decade -- revealed in an episode of “Dr. Phil” she is happily married years after her harrowing escape.

Michelle Knight, 36, who now goes by the name Lily Rose, announced the news in an episode set to air April 24, TMZ reported Monday.

“I got really good news for you…Dr. Phil, I’m married!” Knight said as the audience cheered.

Knight said she's been married since May 2015, two years after she was rescued from her captor, Ariel Castro. Her husband's name is Miguel, according to TMZ.

547,Oregon lowering education standards for minority students enabling ‘school to prison pipeline’: Maj Toure,Angelica Stabile,"

Oregon schools are no longer requiring reading and math as standards for graduation which is only feeding the American crisis of under-education leading to future incarceration, ""Black Guns Matter"" founder Maj Toure argued on ""Fox News Primetime"" Tuesday.

""This is the school-to-prison pipeline via legislation,"" he said. ""This type of legislation that has tremendously been supported and pushed by the left.""

""Anyone who even thinks to present something like this – forget no child left behind. We’re not even going to make there be a line for you to get behind in the first place,"" he went on. ""We’re going to pretend like there is no standard.""

OREGON GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL SUSPENDING MATH, READING PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENT FOR HS GRADUATES

Toure stressed that any politician in support of this kind of legislation should never be voted into office because they have ""no interest"" in the future of America’s youth.

""I don’t care what ethnic group you’re from,"" he said. ""As an American, you should be incensed by this and any other politician should be put on note.""

Toure called Oregon’s new standards the ""soft bigotry of low expectations"" for underprivileged and minority students who assumedly ""can’t really do it anyway"" in regards to basic curriculum.

""This is the type of legislation that wants to make Black Americans that work very hard, may not have the best economic scenario, but this is the type of legislation that they want to make Black people a permanent underclass,"" he said. ""It’s goofy and it’s wrong but it’s par for the course for the Dems on the left.""

Cicero Institute COO Whitney Munro backed Toure’s argument, noting how America’s children today are in need of proper education to climb the aforementioned manipulated socio-economic ladder.

""They’ve pulled the rug out from under these kids,"" she said. ""It’s very sad, it’s very tragic and, to be completely honest, we need to be holding them accountable for the things that they are doing now that are going to create generations of children who cannot achieve what is possible for them because of these decisions.""

548,Oberlin College attempt to overturn defamation suit from bakery it called 'racist' falls short,Adam Sabes,"

Oberlin College in Ohio suffered another legal blow in its years-long battle to overturn a jury decision that found the college defamed a local bakery, with an Ohio appeals court upholding a previous $25 million judgment awarded to a local business that claims the college committed libel against it.

In 2016, Allyn Gibson, the son of Gibson’s Bakery and Food Mart owners David Gibson and Allyn Gibson, chased down and tackled a Black student who he suspected stealing a bottle of wine. Two Black students at Oberlin College, who were friends of the individual who stole the bottle of wine, became involved in the physical incident. All three students were arrested, according to court documents, and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges.

The bakery's owners sued Oberlin College in 2017, claiming that the school had libeled them and said that their business was harmed by their actions.

In a Thursday 9th District Court of Appeals ruling, which was unanimous, the three judge panel rejected Oberlin college's claims and upheld a previous ruling that the college is responsible for paying the Gibson's legal fees, amounting to $6.3 million. The previous ruling also awarded $25 million to the bakery in damages.

OBERLIN COLLEGE TO PAY BAKERY THE NOW-MASSIVE SUM OF $44M OVER RACISM DISPUTE

Lorain County Judge John Mirald initially awarded over $40 million to the bakery, but was later brought down to $25 million. The appeals ruling denied Oberlin College's request for a new trial, while also rejecting a claim by the bakery owners that the amount awarded does not go far enough in punishing the school.

Oberlin College officials said that they are reviewing their options, but are disappointed with the decision.

Following the shoplifting incident, Oberlin College students protested outside the bakery. During the protest, Oberlin College vice president and dean of students, Meredith Raimondo, handed out flyers stating that the bakery is a ""RACIST establishment with a LONG ACCOUNT of RACIAL PROFILING and DISCRIMINATION,"" according to court documents.

Court documents also show that college resources were used to print the flyers and buy food and other supplies for the protesters. The college also stopped buying food from the bakery.

In addition, the Oberlin College Student Senate passed a resolution accusing the bakery owners of being racist, which was emailed to all students.

Oberlin College has dedicated an entire webpage to the lawsuit, calling it a ""threat to free speech.""

The bakery owners, David Gibson and Allyn Gibson, have since died.

549,"Biden admin agencies refuse to answer, 'What is a woman?'",Timothy Nerozzi,"

A handful of Biden administration federal agencies were unable to define the meaning of the word ""woman"" – in some cases, even in relation to their own uses of terms such as ""women's health"" – when asked by Fox News Digital.

The Biden administration's Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons were all contacted by Fox News Digital requesting a definition of ""woman."" None of the agencies provided their definition or criteria for an individual to be categorized as a ""woman,"" despite each boasting entire initiatives aimed at helping women and DOJ declined to comment.

Fox News Digital also reached out to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to request the organization's definition of ""woman"" in relation to terms such as ""women's rights"" and ""women's healthcare."" NIH describes itself as ""the steward of medical and behavioral research for the Nation,"" and its purpose as ""[seeking] fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems.""

KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, BIDEN'S SUPREME COURT PICK, REFUSES TO DEFINE THE WORD 'WOMAN'

When asked for the definition, the NIH directed Fox News Digital to its website section on ""sex and gender.""

""'Sex' refers to biological differences between females and males, including chromosomes, sex organs, and endogenous hormonal profiles,"" the NIH claims on their website. ""'Gender' refers to socially constructed and enacted roles and behaviors which occur in a historical and cultural context and vary across societies and over time. All individuals act in many ways that fulfill the gender expectations of their society. With continuous interaction between sex and gender, health is determined by both biology and the expression of gender.""

However, the literature provided by the NIH did not address the meaning of ""woman"" or ""women"" in relation to sex and gender. Despite using the word frequently in their writing, no explanation is given on whether the word ""women"" – as used by the NIH – is descriptive of sex or gender.

Asked for clarification, the NIH refused to comment further.

""Glad the page was somewhat useful,"" the NIH replied, but continued, ""We don’t have anything else to add.""

Fox News Digital also reached out directly to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment on the issue. After two days and multiple replies stating that the inquiry would be addressed, the HHS failed to provide an answer.

The HHS' Office of Population Affairs released a document Thursday titled ""Gender Affirming Care and Young People."" The same day, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Child Traumatic Stress Network – another subset of the HHS – released a parallel document titled, ""Gender-Affirming Care Is Trauma-Informed Care.""

The HHS documents describe what it calls appropriate treatments for transgender adolescents, including: ""'Top' surgery – to create male-typical chest shape or enhance breasts;"" and ""'Bottom' surgery – surgery on genitals or reproductive organs, facial feminization or other procedures.""

The RAND Corporation – a think tank almost entirely funded by the U.S. government for the purposes of consultation on military policy – also stated that they did not have a definition for the word ""woman,"" despite extensive research into women's rights, health and fitness.

""You are correct in that RAND has done a number of studies related to gender and women specifically, but our reports are mostly focused on the impacts to women of various policies or circumstances,"" a RAND spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""I don’t believe your question is one that we have ever explicitly researched, thus I don’t have anyone who can speak to it. Sorry we can’t be more help.""

Asked how RAND is able to measure or research the impacts to women of various policies without a definition of the word, RAND did not respond.

RAND receives approximately $68.4 million in funds from the HHS, and more than 70% of their funds are from U.S. government agencies.

Kara Dansky, U.S. president of Women's Declaration International, told Fox News Digital on a press call hosted by Independent Women's Voice & Independent Women's Law Center Thursday that ""President Biden began to obliterate sex as a distinct category immediately upon taking office when he signed Executive Order 13988 on preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of so-called gender identity and sexual orientation.""

She said that Biden administration agencies including DOJ, HHS, HUD and others ""have all announced that women no longer exist as a coherent category as a matter of federal administrative law.""

On Thursday, Independent Women’s Voice, Independent Women’s Law Center, Women’s Liberation Front and other advocates introduced a ""Women's Bill of Rights"" to ""reserve biological sex as a distinct legal category.""

A press release accompanying the announcement stated that dictionaries commonly define ""woman"" as an ""adult female human being."" The advocacy groups are concerned by ""activists"" who are distorting and disputing the ""biological basis of womanhood.""

The issue has intensified as controversial female transgender swimmer, Lia Thomas, was allowed to compete in the NCAA women's swimming championship last month. She beat out biological females in many of her races, which many say can be attributed to her larger size and stature as a biological male.

During the Senate hearings for Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson last week, the prospective justice was asked by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., to define the term ""woman."" After a short back-and-forth, Jackson told the senator that she could not provide a definition because she is ""not a biologist.""

""Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman?’"" the senator asked.

""Can I provide a definition? No,"" Jackson responded. ""I can't.""

""You can't?"" Blackburn asked.

""Not in this context, I'm not a biologist,"" the judge replied.

Jackson's inability to define the word caused major backlash from conservatives, who questioned how she would handle topics explicitly related to gender differences if confirmed as a Supreme Court justice.

Florida police say a 27-year-old Miami man died of a knife wound to the chest Sunday — as video shows his Instagram model girlfriend was spotted soaked in blood, wearing handcuffs and being questioned by investigators.

But so far, there have been no charges.

Christian Tobechukwu Obumseli suffered ""an apparent knife wound"" in a domestic violence incident before first responders rushed him 2.5 miles away to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami police said in a statement. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

A lawyer for his girlfriend, Courtney Clenney, said she was defending herself.

FLORIDA MOM, BIKINI MODEL, DEFENDS FAMILY IN GUNFIGHT DURING ARMED HOME INVASION

Video showing the aftermath of the altercation obtained by TMZ appears to show a distraught, blood-covered woman in handcuffs sitting on a balcony, speaking with police. The front of her white sweatpants is stained red, as are her arms, chest, stomach and forehead.

Authorities said they had interviewed a woman who was involved in ""a physical altercation"" with Obumseli and that homicide detectives were investigating. A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that Clenney was taken to a hospital under the Baker Act for a mental evaluation.

""The Clenney family is devastated by the events leading up to the death of Christian and send their deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and loved ones,"" said Frank Prieto, Clenney’s attorney. ""Clearly, none of this was intended and Courtney is struggling mentally with the aftermath of what occurred that evening.""

The Miami-based WPLG 10 reported Friday that friends of the couple described ""a very rocky relationship"" — although the sources gave conflicting stories about who might have been the aggressor.

Prieto said that 1 in 4 U.S. women are victims of domestic violence, as well as 1 in 9 men.

""As Courtney struggles with the pain of being a survivor of domestic violence and the aftermath of the events that evening, we ask that the community and Christian’s family allow the police and the state to conduct their independent investigation of the events,"" he said. ""This is a tragedy for all involved but it was not criminal conduct; Courtney was defending herself and the investigation will reveal exactly that.""

Police said the incident happened in the luxury apartment building El Paraiso, at 3131 NE 7 Avenue.

The couple reportedly broke up last month, according to the Miami Herald, and Obumseli allegedly began sleeping in the building’s common areas.

Then on April 1, Miami police were dispatched to their apartment for a separate domestic call, the paper reported, citing local law enforcement sources. The officers found bruises on Clenney’s arms and legs, but no one was arrested.

Lee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney representing Obumseli’s family, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

A young Ukrainian couple has become a symbol of love and strength for the country after they decided to get married three months before their planned wedding in May when Russia began invading their homeland.

Yaryna Arieva, a 21-year-old woman wise beyond her years, told Fox News Digital that she and her 24-year-old husband, Sviatoslav Fursin, discussed getting ""married in the first days of the war"" if Putin invaded, but they didn't ""really believe"" it would happen.

When the attacks began, her mother called around to the priests she knew in the area and got one to marry the couple without an official marriage certificate, which is very unusual in Ukraine, but the priest agreed due to unforeseen circumstances.

Arieva and Fursin joined Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces immediately after their wedding. The couple is based in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital and Russian President Vladimir Putin's main target, as it houses Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A convoy of Russian military vehicles has been stalled outside the city for several days as Putin plans a government takeover.

Meanwhile, Russia has been targeting the capital with missile strikes. Arieva described two massive explosions that struck the city on Wednesday — one that woke her at 1:30 a.m. and lit up her room as if it were daytime.

She hasn't left shelter for seven days and said civilians who are not actively fighting need a secret passcode to go outside for their own protection.

Her husband was on a combat mission with the Territorial Defense Forces on Thursday when she spoke to Fox News Digital. The forces are on the second lines, assisting the Armed Forces of Ukraine in their efforts to push back against Russian military forces out of Kyiv.

""He was completely, extremely exhausted after the last mission,"" Arieva said. ""[H]e just couldn't find normal words to describe what he wants and what he thinks, and it was awful. He didn't sleep for two days…but he has been [in shelter] for three days, and he had a chance to take a rest a little bit. So, it was better for him…when he was taken to the next mission.""

She added that Fursin is ""the second commander of his group"" of about 15 soldiers despite not having ""a lot of military experience"" because ""his father and his father-in-law were soldiers, and they have told him some things.""

""He is very, physically, very strong, and he loves sports, and he has some knowledge about armor, so he was one of the best in his group,"" Arieva explained.

While Kyiv remains intact even as it is bombarded with missile attacks, southern cities are struggling more to fight off the Russian military. Kherson, a strategically important city located near the Black Sea, fell Wednesday evening to Russian forces, becoming the first major city to fall since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last week.

But Arieva and Fursin are optimistic for Ukraine's future.

""People here are absolutely sure that we will win,"" she said. ""It's just the question of time. And also we are laughing at Russians. We are making jokes, telling anecdotes — not only about Russians but about [the] situation,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Two of four men were acquitted Friday in a conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, motivated by fury at the Democrat’s tough COVID-19 restrictions early in the pandemic.

The verdicts against Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta were read in the federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Jurors said they couldn’t agree on verdicts against Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. Prosecutors described Fox as a ringleader of an anti-government group.

Earlier in the day, the jurors said that there are several counts which the deliberative body were deadlocked on. Testimony began on March 9.

""It is not unusual to come back somewhere along the line of deliberations and say 'we tried, but couldn’t get there,'"" U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker said, according to Detroit News. ""At least not on everything.""

TRIAL RESUME FOR 4 MEN ACCUSED OF MICHIGAN GOVERNOR PLOT

He encouraged the jurors to continue deliberations in hopes of reaching a unanimous decision, saying, ""Before that’s the final answer, I would like you to go back and make another effort to see if you can come to an agreement on issues you are stuck on as a group.""

Fox, Croft and Harris faced additional charges. The two most serious charges, kidnapping conspiracy and conspiracy to use explosives, both carry potential life sentences.

The trial lasted over 20 days. Prosecutors said they turned their anger toward the government in 2020 into a plot to kidnap Whitmer because of the restrictions she imposed during the early months of the pandemic.

Defense lawyers claimed informants and undercover agents improperly influenced the men.

Federal prosecutors countered the argument with evidence that the men discussed abducting Whitmer before the FBI sting began and that they went beyond talk. They scouted Whitmer's summer home and tested explosives, they said.

According to evidence, a homemade explosive was detonated during training in September 2020, about a month before the men were arrested.

In his closing argument on April 1, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler said Croft wanted to test the explosive as a possible weapon to use against Whitmer's security team. He quoted him as saying the pennies would be so hot they could go ""right through your skin.""

Whitmer, a Democrat who is seeking reelection, rarely talks publicly about the case. She has blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case. She has said Trump was complicit in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

A man upset over state-ordered coronavirus restrictions was sentenced to just over six years in prison last year after admitting to involvement in the plot – a significant break that reflected his quick decision to cooperate and help agents build cases against others.

Ty Garbin admitted his role in the alleged scheme weeks after his arrest last fall. He is among six men charged in federal court but the only one to plead guilty so far. It was a key victory for prosecutors as they try to prove an astonishing plot against the others.

A former science adviser for Bill Gates said Tuesday he was “shocked” to learn Jeffrey Epstein had named him as a back-up executor of his $578 million will, according to a report.

Boris Nikolic, a 49-year-old biotech venture capitalist, was named as one of three executors of Epstein’s will which was filed Monday in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned two islands, Little St. James and Great St. James. Nikolic was a former science adviser to Gates, the Microsoft founder and philanthropist.

“I was not consulted in these matters and I have no intent to fulfill these duties, whatsoever,” Nikolic said in a statement provided to Bloomberg.

“I was not consulted in these matters and I have no intent to fulfill these duties, whatsoever.” — Boris Nikolic, former science adviser to Bill Gates

Epstein reportedly signed his will two days before he died at age 66 after being found hanging in his Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10. The New York City medical examiner's office ruled his death a suicide, but his attorneys vowed to continue investigating as they suspect foul play.

By signing the document, Epstein effectively transferred $578 million in assets to The 1953 Trust, named after the year the disgraced financier was born. The names of the trustees have not been made public, The Daily Beast reported. Epstein's will names his brother, Mark Epstein, as his sole relative who might have some financial claims to the trust's assets.

Epstein’s long-time attorneys, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, were named as the primary executors of the will. They are to receive $250,000 of Epstein’s $577 million in assets as compensation for their efforts curating the will.

Epstein named Nikolic as the successor executor, or the back-up executor, should Indyke and Kahn not be able to carry out their duties. The extent of Nikolic and Epstein’s relationship was unclear.

Nikolic is an immunologist who completed post-doctoral work at Harvard and currently works at the for-profit venture firm Biomatics Capital. One unnamed source told Bloomberg that Nikolic received financial advice from Epstein leading up to the public offering of the gene-editing company Editas Medicine Inc.

It goes on to say that the CIA source indicated to CI MELODY-3’s [CIA informant] he had taken a picture with Hitler, but ""did not show the photograph.""

HITLER MAY HAVE COME CLOSE TO BUILDING AN ATOMIC BOMB, GERMAN TREASURE HUNTER FINDS

The document, three pages in length, suggests that Hitler may have worked as a shipping company employee, prior to potentially fleeing to Argentina. On the second page is a picture of the informant, Phillip Citroen, with a person he claims is Hitler in the mid-1950s.

“CIMELODY-3’s friend states that during the later part of September 1955, a Phillip Citroen, former German SS trooper, stated to him confidentially that Adolph Hitler (sic) is still alive,"" the documents state.

Hitler committed suicide by taking a cyanide capsule and shooting himself. His wife Eva Braun killed herself by swallowing a cyanide pill. His body was later discovered by Soviet soldiers and buried in an unmarked spot. A German court declared Hitler dead, but not until 1956, more than a decade after the war ended.

Despite the findings of the German court, rumors have abounded for years that Hitler survived and fled to South America. The discovery of Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele — the doctor who carried out sick experiments on Auschwitz inmates — in Argentina and Brazil respectively has only added fuel to the rumors, according to a report in news.com.au, which is part of 21st Century Fox.

Eichmann was eventually captured and hanged by Israel for his crimes in 1961, but Mengele managed to avoid capture. He ultimately died, having drowned while swimming off the coast of Brazil in 1979.

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins was killed early Saturday morning in Florida after being struck by a dump truck in Broward County, authorities said. He was 24 years old.

Haskins, who was set to turn 25 next month, was in South Florida training with the team when he tragically died, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported first, citing Haskins' agent.

STEELERS’ DWAYNE HASKINS ON BEING AN NFL STARTING QUARTERBACK: ‘I GOT DRAFTED FOR THAT REASON’

Haskins was attempting to cross the westbound lanes of Interstate 595 on foot when he was hit by a dump truck, according to the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP). Haskins was pronounced dead at the scene, and authorities said it was ""unknown"" why he was walking on the interstate.

A traffic homicide investigation is ongoing, FHP said.

Westbound traffic on the interstate was shut down Saturday morning, and drivers were advised to see alternative routes, the FHP said.

""I am devastated and at a loss for words with the unfortunate passing of Dwayne Haskins,"" head coach Mike Tomlin said in a statement. ""He quickly became part of our Steelers family upon his arrival in Pittsburgh and was one of our hardest workers, both on and off the field and in our community.""

""Dwayne was a great teammate, but even more so a tremendous friend to so many,"" Tomlin said. ""I am truly heartbroken.""

562,"New Jersey to require 2nd graders learn about gender identity in fall, alarming parents",Houston Keene,"

New Jersey public school second graders will be getting lessons related to gender identity this fall under state sex education guidelines that will take effect in September.

The standards listed ""performance expectations"" for second graders, which include discussing ""the range of ways people express their gender and how gender role stereotypes may limit behavior.""

Educators in the Garden State are preparing to carry out the teaching standards, which were established in 2020 but not required to be enacted until Sept. 2022.

One school district in the state distributed sample lesson plans indicating first graders could be taught they can have ""boy parts"" but ""feel like"" a girl.

NEW JERSEY TEACHER SAYS HER STOMACH WAS ‘CHURNING’ FOLLOWING UNION DEMAND TO LOG STUDENTS’ VACCINATION STATUS

The lesson plans, which were given to parents at the Westfield Board of Education's Feb. 22 meeting, appear to be reflective of the Garden State's new, broader sex education curriculum.

One lesson plan , ""Purple, Pink and Blue,"" instructs teachers to talk to their first graders about gender identity, and its first objective is to have the students be able to define ""gender, gender identity and gender role stereotypes.""

The lesson’s second objective is to have students name ""at least two things they’ve been taught about gender role stereotypes and how those things may limit people of all genders.""

""Gender identity is that feeling of knowing your gender. You might feel like you are a boy, you might feel like you are a girl,"" the lesson plan states. ""You might feel like you’re a boy even if you have body parts that some people might tell you are ‘girl’ parts. You might feel like you’re a girl even if you have body parts that some people might tell you are ‘boy’ parts.

""And you might not feel like you’re a boy or a girl, but you’re a little bit of both. No matter how you feel, you’re perfectly normal!""

Another lesson plan for second graders, "" Understanding Our Bodies , "" tells teachers to instruct students that ""there are some body parts that mostly just girls have and some parts that mostly just boys have.""

""Being a boy or a girl doesn’t have to mean you have those parts, but for most people this is how their bodies are,"" the plan states. ""Most people have a vulva and a vagina or a penis and testicles, but some people’s bodies can be different. Your body is exactly what is right for you.""

The objectives for this second grade lesson include having children be able to ""identify at least four body parts"" from female and male genitalia, and for students to describe ""why it is important for them to know the correct names for the genitals.""

A spokesperson for Westfield Public Schools told Fox News Digital that the teaching materials were not the school district's plans. The school superintendent told Fox News Digital that the materials presented to parents at the February Board of Education meeting were a ""sample list of resources"" aligned with state policy.

""During a presentation at the Feb. 22 Board of Education meeting, we provided an update on the district’s work to revise the Comprehensive Health and Physical Education curriculum,"" Superintendent Dr. Raymond González said.

DEMOCRATS CLAIM FLORIDA IS PUSHING 'DON'T SAY GAY' BILL. HERE'S WHAT THE LEGISLATION ACTUALLY SAYS

""The presentation included a sample list of resources aligned to the New Jersey Student Learning Standards to be considered as school districts work on revisions to the health and PE curriculum.

""We made it clear at the meeting and subsequent meetings that these are resources only — they are not state-mandated — and that the district is in the process of developing its revised curriculum to meet state standards,"" the superintendent continued.

Republicans say the lesson plans show the educational priorities of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration are misplaced.

""It’s simple. Gov. Murphy thinks he knows better how to parent your children than you do,"" Alexandra Wilkes, the New Jersey GOP’s communications director, told Fox News Digital.

""The shocking, graphic materials taught to children barely old enough to read and write fly in the face of the Democrats' insistence on the campaign trail last fall that critics of these new standards were exaggerating or even bigoted for raising concerns in the first place.

""Democrats lied to parents, belittled and shamed them for wanting a say in their children’s education, and they're about to find out this November what happens when you mess with other people's kids.""

Legislators in the state also blasted the Murphy administration over the school district's lesson plans.

State Sen. Holly Schepisi, a Republican who was sent the materials by concerned parents, told Fox News Digital that as ""a mom and a legislator, I can appreciate the need for students to receive age-appropriate instruction, but this is beyond the pale.

""We knew that when Gov. Murphy used the cover of the pandemic to push these new standards through that something was terribly wrong, and now we can clearly see why they needed to do this in secret. The agenda has swung so far left in an attempt to sexualize our precious children that parents are fighting back.

""Based on the overwhelming outreach I have received from parents, Democrats should expect a reckoning this fall.""

Schepisi’s colleague, Republican state Sen. Michael Testa, did not mince words in a statement to Fox News Digital, calling the elementary school sex education lesson plans ""abuse.""

FLORIDA'S DESANTIS SIGNS PARENTAL RIGHTS IN EDUCATION BILL, HITS BACK AT HOLLYWOOD CRITICS

""We fought for kids to return to school in person. Then we had to fight to take off our kids’ masks. Now, we have to watch our elementary school children, who have already fallen behind thanks to the Murphy lockdowns, learn about genitalia and gender identity?"" Testa said. ""It’s abuse, plain and simple.""

Testa also had a message to ""every Democrat on the ballot this fall,"" ahead of a widely-predicted Republican wave, to ""get ready for the army of parents who will not sit by and watch you steal the innocence of our children without a fight.""

New Jersey Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn, a Republican, said that as ""a mother, former Board of Education member and current member of the Assembly Education Committee, I am disturbed that Gov. Murphy and the Department of Education are not laser focused on addressing learning and proficiency gaps stemming from COVID lockdowns and remote learning, and instead implement curricula intended to indoctrinate elementary school students and substitute the role of parents in these sensitive topics.

""No kid should have to talk about sex with their elementary school teacher.""

New Jersey political commentators also weighed in, with radio host and dad Matt Rooney warning that these lesson plans are what happen ""when you let [New Jersey Education Association] radicals and far-left wackos take control of your children's education.""

In June 2020, New Jersey’s board of education broadened its sex education standards to include lessons on both abortion and gender identity.

563,Elon Musk mocks Washington Post after op-ed calls to prevent 'rich people' from controlling media platforms,Joseph Wulfsohn,"

Tesla CEO Elon Musk had some fun at the expense of The Washington Post in a response to an op-ed condemning his growing influence with Twitter.

Musk shocked the world this week when it was revealed he purchased 9.2% stake in Twitter, Inc., making him the largest shareholder in the social media giant. He made even more headlines when it was announced that he was joining Twitter's board of directors, suggesting he could have influence over Twitter's policies in favor of free speech principles.

The Post published a piece on Friday titled, ""Elon Musk’s vision of ‘free speech’ will be bad for Twitter."" In it, tech investor and former Reddit CEO Ellen K. Pao bashed the billionaire's bought-in ""welcome"" to Twitter, calling it ""highly disconcerting — a slap in the face, even.""

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER SAYS THERE'S A ‘FEAR’ ABOUT ELON MUSK BECOMING TWITTER'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER

""Musk has been open about his preference that Twitter do less to restrict speech that many see as hateful, abusive or dangerous. Given his new influence, the way he himself has used the platform bodes ill for its future,"" Pao wrote. ""Musk, who has nearly 81 million followers, often punches down in his tweets, displaying very little empathy. He called a British caver who helped to rescue trapped young Thai divers ‘a pedo guy’ (beating a defamation suit over the slur but adding to his reputation as a bully). In February, he tweeted, then deleted, a meme comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.""

Pao mocked the tech mogul for calling himself a ""free-speech absolutist,"" writing, ""like many ‘free speech’ advocates, he willfully ignores that private companies are free to establish some limits on their platforms.""

""Twitter made strides to remove hate and harassment and to give users more control over how they share their opinions… It added features that let users limit who could reply to their tweets, created labels for misleading content and banned President Donald Trump’s account. After all that, bringing Musk onto the board seems like a big step backward,"" Pao wrote. ""He can bend the company toward his preferences, removing reasonable policies on hateful speech and urging people who are harassed to have thicker skins.""

MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST CALLS ELON MUSK'S TWITTER PURCHASE LIKE ‘ARSONISTS COSPLAYING AS FIREFIGHTERS’

She continued, ""Musk’s appointment to Twitter’s board shows that we need regulation of social-media platforms to prevent rich people from controlling our channels of communication. For starters, we need consistent definitions of harassment and of content that violates personal privacy. Most companies, I suspect, would welcome such regulations… If platforms continue to push for growth at all costs — without such regulations — people will continue to be harmed. The people harmed will disproportionately be those who have been harmed for centuries — women and members of marginalized racial and ethnic groups. The people who benefit from unrestricted amplification of their views will also be the same people who have benefited from that privilege for centuries.""

The irony of The Washington Post publishing Pao's remark calling for ""regulation of social media platforms to prevent rich people from controlling our channels of communication"" was not lost among critics, who pointed out that the paper is owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos.

Even Musk himself was in on the joke.

""Lmaooo,"" Musk reacted to the op-ed excerpt.

BLOOMBERG OP-ED CLAIMS ELON MUSK TWITTER TAKEOVER ‘BAD NEWS’ FOR FREE SPEECH, MUSK RESPONDS

Several members of the media have been sounding the alarm about Musk's growing involvement with Twitter.

Bloomberg Opinion senior columnist and MSNBC political analyst Tim O'Brien called the move ""bad news"" for free speech,

""That’s worrisome because it's not ideal to have a free speech absolutist who isn’t absolutely in favor of free speech at the helm of — or even close to — a media company,"" O'Brien wrote. ""And he’s in it to scare Twitter’s management. Somebody who has complained that his free speech is being ‘chilled’ should, perhaps, be sensitive to those nuances.""

CNN's left-wing media correspondent Brian Stelter said there's a ""fear"" about Musk becoming a Twitter shareholder.

""There's interest in billionaires, there's celebration of the Musk. There's also fear, I think, sometimes or wariness of - okay, so here's the richest man on the planet who just bought a big chunk of one of our most important communications tools,"" Stelter said. ""He's also one of the biggest owners of satellites in the world. So he's incredibly powerful, incredibly, I don't know, am I allowed to use the word ‘strange’ when talking about Elon Musk?""

565,Judge who headed 'Drag Queen Story Hour' sponsor arrested on child porn charges,Houston Keene,"

A Milwaukee judge and former president of an LGBTQ organization that sponsored Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH) events has been arrested on child pornography charges.

Judge Brett Blomme, 38, was arrested and charged with seven counts of child pornography possession. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, he is accused of uploading 27 videos and pictures of child sexual abuse to the messaging app Kik under the name ""DomMasterBB.""

Each count against Blomme carries with it a minimum sentence of three years with the potential for up to 15 years with a decade of supervised release. With seven counts charged against him, Blomme is looking at a minimum of 21 years in prison should he be convicted.

Blomme was also a former president for the Cream City Foundation — an LGBTQ advocacy group in Wisconsin that advertised DQSH events it sponsored — as well as a husband and adoptive father of two children. Blomme listed his presidency with the Cream City Foundation on his LinkedIn profile.

ACLU SUES LOUISIANA LIBRARY OVER DRAG QUEEN STORY HOUR BAN

Blomme’s presence on the Cream City Foundation website was quickly scrubbed in the days since his arrest, with his articles removed and the board of directors page nixing the judge’s information completely.

The judge’s two children were not involved in the sexual exploitation, according to court documents, but Child Protective Services is looking to place the children elsewhere amid the charges, the Sentinal reported.

In the complaint, Blomme was said to have uploaded the photos on a friend’s wifi. The friend, noted in the complaint as ""Individual B,"" confirmed to investigators that Blomme had visited his house on days that the friend's WiFi showed images uploaded by ""DomMasterBB.""

The Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Blomme from his psoition without pay amid the charges, the Sentinal reported. Blomme was elected to his judgeship in 2020. He has yet to give a plea.

In a statement to Fox News, DQSH Executive Director Jonathan Hamilt said the Milwaukee branch of the organization was ""deeply saddened and disappointed to learn about the actions of Judge Brett Blomme.""

Hamilt clarified that the Cream City Foundation was a strictly a ""fiscal sponsor"" for DQSH Milwaukee that allowed it to operate as a non-profit and that Blomme was never directly involved with event planning nor held a position within DQSH.

""However, Drag Queen Story Hour wishes to make clear: while Cream City Foundation has served as DQSH Milwaukee’s fiscal sponsor (allowing DQSH Milwaukee to receive funds as a non-profit), the relationship is strictly financial: Cream City Foundation does not direct or influence the content of our programming, and Brett Blomme has never held a position within DQSH Milwaukee nor participate directly in planning, organizing, or hosting any of our events,"" said Hamilt.

The DQSH executive director said that the Milwaukee organization ""has never been run"" by either the Cream City Foundation or Blomme and reiterated that neither the judge or the Cream City Foundation were involved in any DQSH events.

""DQSH Milwaukee has never been run by the Cream City Foundation nor Brett Blomme, neither have either participated in planning, organizing, hosting or performing at any of our events. Brett has never held a title or position within our organization ever,"" said Hamilt. ""Cream City Foundation has only ever been a fiscal sponsor that allows DQSH Milwaukee to give and receive funds as a non-profit. Asides from financials, they have had no part in DQSH Milwaukee & DQSH HQ.""

Hamilt also told Fox News that the Milwaukee DQSH is ""cutting all ties with Cream City Foundation as their acting fiscal sponsor"" and gave a strong condemnation of Blomme's actions.

""As the leaders of DQSH Milwaukee & DQSH HQ, we absolutely condemn pedophilia, We are angry and outraged by Brett's actions,"" said Hamilt. ""Pedophilia has no place in the LGBT community and no place in society as a whole.""

""Drag Queen Story Hour is an organization dedicated to creating safe inclusive spaces for children and their families,"" he continued. ""All of our in-network drag storytellers are required to have background checks.""

""If you or anyone you know is the victim of child abuse we ask you reach out to the National Child Abuse Hotline, 1-800-422-4453,"" added Hamilt.

The Cream City Foundation did not immediately respond to Fox News’ requests for comment.

TV personality and medical professional Dr. Mehmet Oz's previous statements on gun control have raised eyebrows after his entry into the 2022 Senate race in Pennsylvania as a Republican candidate, though Oz now says he firmly supports gun rights.

Oz has voiced support for ""red flag"" laws, which would allow the government to confiscate guns from individuals without proof of malicious intent.

""Part of the hope, I gather, is that we'll make a system so that I can call in and say 'There's evidence besides my testimony that this person is dangerous. Look at their Facebook feed or social media postings. Or comments they've made to coworkers beside me. Do a little investigating. I'm alerting you, putting a little red flag up there saying this person is a concern,'"" Oz told the audience on a previous episode of his show.

He also previously promoted a call from the American College of Physicians for a ban on semi-automatic weapons, though he didn't explicitly endorse such a ban himself.

MASSACHUSETTS VETERAN WHO SAYS WOMAN ASSAULTED HIM FOR SUPPORTING TRUMP VOWS 'WE'LL BE BACK'

Oz has criticized gun laws in America and spotlighted the #ThisIsOurLane campaign – a movement of medical professionals seeking greater restrictions on firearm purchases in the United States.

The movement gained steam and found its name after the National Rifle Association told doctors pushing greater restrictions on gun purchases to ""stay in their lane.""

In a statement to Fox News after this article was published, Oz said he's a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.

""As a proud gun owner myself, I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment and our constitutional right to bear arms for protection. I do not believe there should be any policy or law, state or federal, that prevents a law-abiding American from purchasing a gun without due process and fair adjudication,"" Oz said.

Oz does not include gun violence or the Second Amendment on the list of issues on his website.



""Dr. Oz seeks to rebuild the middle layers of society – institutions like family and community – that have been hollowed out by failed policies, narrow thinking, and toxic culture wars,"" the website reads. ""He knows that no government can substitute for the dignity of work, the security of health care, and the spiritual support of our family.""

A Los Angeles news anchor died in December after overdosing on methamphetamine during a sexual encounter with a male companion at a California hotel, an autopsy report revealed Friday.

Glendale Police were called to a Days Inn hotel around 1:15 p.m. on Dec. 27 to find KTLA news anchor Christopher Burrous unresponsive and suffering from a “medical emergency,” officials said in a press release.

Police say a male who'd been with Burrous at the time placed the call.

Burrous was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Initial reports suggested that Burrous likely suffered a possible overdose.

The Los Angeles County coroner released a report on Friday ruling his death an accident by means of meth toxicity. It also elaborated on the circumstances of his death.

According to the report, Burrous was engaging in “various sexual activities with his companion” when he inserted a “rock” of meth into his rectum. He reportedly inserted a second rock later on in the encounter, placed a mask on and “doused the filters with ‘poppers.’”

“Poppers” refer to an inhalant of amyl nitrate.

Burrous began to grunt and vomit before becoming unresponsive. The male individual, who has not been identified, performed CPR on Burrous before the paramedics arrived, the report stated.

The coroner's office also noted that hypertension and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease may have contributed to Burrous’ death.

Burrous had worked for KTLA since 2011 and previously worked at WPIX in New York. He is survived by his wife and a daughter, 9.

569,Canadian pastor who was jailed for 51 days after speaking to trucker convoy alleges mistreatment in prison,Jon Brown,"

A Polish-Canadian pastor who was jailed for 51 days after addressing truckers along the U.S.-Canada border in Coutts, Alberta, recounted to Fox News Digital what he alleges was his mistreatment in prison.

Pastor Artur Pawlowski of the Cave of Adullam congregation in Calgary also spoke about his opportunities to minister to his fellow inmates and called on Alberta to do more to rehabilitate prisoners.

‘Hold the line’

On Feb. 7, Pawlowski was arrested for the fifth time since the beginning of the pandemic after he delivered a speech to the trucker convoy, members of which asked him to speak to their group and officiate a church service along Alberta's border with Montana. The truckers were protesting a Canadian mandate that forces truckers crossing the border with the U.S. to be vaccinated.

Pawlowski has become a prominent figure since first making international headlines during an Easter service in April 2021, when he threw armed police out of his sanctuary as they attempted to inspect it for COVID-19 compliance.

After continuing to hold church services in defiance of a court order, the pastor endured repeated dramatic arrests, including in the middle of a busy Calgary highway and on the tarmac of the Calgary International Airport.

During a 20-minute speech to the truckers on Feb. 3, Pawlowski urged them to ""hold the line"" against government overreach without resorting to violence. He also advised them against their plans to travel to Edmonton, the provincial capital, fearing they would face a government crackdown like that which happened in Ottawa.

CANADIAN CLERGY REBUKE TRUDEAU FOR INVOKING EMERGENCIES ACT, OTHER ‘TYRANNICAL ACTIONS'

Pawlowski also recounted to them the parallels he sees between the Freedom Convoy and Poland's Solidarity movement in the 1980s that ultimately led to the liberation of his native country, despite resistance from its communist government.

Before Calgary police apprehended him at his home, Pawlowski was planning to return to the blockade to speak to them again and officiate another church service.

The Crown prosecutor argued in court that Pawlowski issued ""an overt threat to violence,"" an allegation that was echoed by Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. According to video of his remarks, the pastor repeatedly told the truckers not to resort to violence during their protests.

‘The scariest time’

Pawlowski was taken to Calgary Remand Centre, where he alleges he was treated poorly. He said he was placed for a time in a small metal cage, not given water for a whole day, and deprived of both his glasses and a Bible for several days. He claimed he was strip-searched repeatedly, spent many hours in solitary confinement and was made to sleep on cold concrete.

Some prison guards were respectful and even intimated to him their belief that he was a political prisoner, but he said others exhibited cruelty. Protests gathered daily for more than 40 days outside the jail, which he said prompted the prison administration to punish the other inmates on his behalf by placing all of them on lockdown.

""They were punishing the entire prison because of me,"" he said. ""And then they paraded me in front of the inmates, saying, ‘That’s the guy. You're being punished because of him. So if you have a chance to do something, that's the villain, that's the guy.'""

""And I think that was the scariest time,"" he added.

""I was told by inmates, and they're willing to testify, that they were approached by different people from within the administration — and the guards bribing them with different incentives to beat me up,"" he said, recounting how his cell door would sometimes be left open, which terrified him.

Pawlowski said he found favor with his fellow inmates, though, many of whom sought him out for spiritual support after recognizing him as the pastor who keeps getting arrested. His unit, which consisted of approximately 20 other men, began to assemble for Bible study with him. Several, he says, converted to Christianity.

CANADIAN PASTOR DEFIANT AS JUDGE ORDERS HIM TO PARROT ‘MEDICAL EXPERTS’ FROM PULPIT: ‘I WILL NOT OBEY’

Shortly before his release on bail, Pawlowski was transferred to Edmonton Remand Centre, which is the largest prison in Canada. There he was placed in the psychiatric ward, where he shared a cell with a paranoid schizophrenic who told him he had killed his own brother with a machete.

""I said, 'Oh my God, please. While I'm sleeping, please protect me,'"" Pawlowski said.

""But you know, I was able to minister to him and pray for him,"" he recounted about his cellmate.

When a worker from Alberta Health Services (AHS) checked on him and asked why he had been placed in the mental ward despite not having been diagnosed with a mental illness, Pawlowski said he had no answer.

He said that only God and the love of his family sustained him during his imprisonment. When he was finally given a Bible and the glasses to read it, he said he began each day with private devotions, which made him realize ""my suffering is very little in comparison to what Jesus went through or what other people went through.""

""So that's what kept me going every day,"" he said.

‘No hope’

Pawlowski, who was eventually transferred back to Calgary Remand Centre, said the most common message he received from the inmates he counseled was despair.

""There's absolutely no hope,"" he said of their situation. ""There's no hope in prison. They don't give you hope. That's why those boys are turning back to drugs, back to dealing, doing bad things and talking about their crime, because no one is tearing them away from their past lifestyle. So no wonder when they come out, they go to the things they know.

""I told them I don't want to hear about that. You don't want to talk about what you have done. You've done terrible things. We all have done terrible things. Now let's see what God wants to do.""

Remembering when one inmate who killed someone had asked him if God could forgive murderers, Pawlowski said he told him, ""If you truly repent from what you have done, your wickedness, God will forgive you. But you cannot go back and do bad things.""

""So he was actually crying when I prayed for him,"" he said.

During an hour-long video interview with Canadian outlet Rebel News, Pawlowski was driven to tears remembering his fellow inmates and how they asked him not to leave on the day of his release.

Alberta's correctional facilities have faced allegations of abuse before, according to the Edmonton Journal.

""We need to have a reformation in our penitentiary system, because the justice system is not just,"" Pawlowski told Fox News.

Provincial remand centers, where inmates are held pending trial, are under the jurisdiction of Alberta Minister of Justice and Solicitor General Tyler Shandro, who previously served as the provincial health minister until 2021.

Fox News reached out to Calgary Remand Centre for comment regarding Pawlowski's allegations and was forwarded to Shandro's office.

""The safety and security of staff, inmates and visitors are a priority for Alberta Justice and Solicitor General,"" a spokesperson for Shandro's office told Fox News. ""Should any individual have concerns about their housing or treatment while in custody, they can submit a complaint to the correctional facility director in writing.

""Information regarding current or former inmates in provincial correctional facilities is protected by privacy legislation. Therefore we are unable to release personal or health-related information,"" the spokesperson added.

‘God is shaking things’

Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Gaylene Kendall granted Pawlowski's bail on March 25 after reviewing his case, but he was required to pay a $25,000 bail and a $10,000 surety from his wife, as well as $2,000 from his son.

He remains under house arrest and is subject to curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and can only leave his residence to conduct worship services or for medical emergencies. He must not participate in any protests. He still faces a slew of charges related to the fallout of keeping his church open during the pandemic.

Pawlowski, who grew up in communist Poland and has been warning of growing tyranny in Canada for 17 years, lamented that ""Canada is going from bad to worse,"" but he remains hopeful that the veil has been lifted on Canadian authorities in recent months. His situation prompted protests at Canadian consulates throughout the United States and moved thousands to sign a letter to Congress urging a resolution condemning his treatment.

In March, a resolution was introduced in the Ohio State Legislature urging the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) to add Canada to its special watch list because of how pastors have been treated in the country, echoing a similar call from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.

Churches throughout Canada have faced imprisoned pastors , locked facilities, steep fines , and continued interference from government officials.

THOUSANDS OF CHURCHES RAISE ALARM ABOUT SCOPE OF NEW CANADIAN ‘CONVERSION THERAPY’ BAN

""It looks like those villains, those tyrants, those dictators are not stopping,"" said Pawlowski. ""And I think that God wants this to be exposed. So those types of people never stop. They need to be exposed.""

""They keep doing evil things, they keep exposing themselves and God keeps exposing them,"" he continued. ""And I just pray that in the process of Canada being judged by God and those people being exposed for who they really are, God would protect his church and his people.

""And even though the past two months were extremely difficult, physically, psychologically, and spiritually for me, He kept me alive. And thank God that they were not able to wound me more than God allowed them to wound me, so I can have a taste of what's really happening behind the closed doors where no one is really looking.

571,"Seattle-area woman agrees to sell home, move after alleged racial outbursts and threats towards neighbor",Danielle Wallace,"

A 72-year-old woman accused of hate crimes against her Vietnamese neighbor has agreed to sell her Seattle-area home as part of a civil agreement with the victim and her family, according to reports.

As per the agreement, Jan Myers, who is White, is expected to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, about nine miles from downtown Seattle, within the next six months and pay the victim, Thi Pham, who is Vietnamese American, $45,000 from that sale, KGW reported. If Myers fails to move from the neighborhood before the time frame is up, the case could be referred to a civil jury.

NYC TEEN CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME AFTER GROUP ATTACKS HASIDIC MAN IN BROOKLYN

The ordeal began in April 2021 when Pham said she was outside in her front yard gardening when she noticed Myers sitting in the roadway staring at her and beginning to move her car back and forth. Fearful of what would happen next, Pham said she began recording and Myers is seen yelling several racial slurs and threats.

In the video, Myers is heard calling Pham ""slant eye"" and ""Miss Vietnam"" and threatening ""you’re not going to live very long."" Pham called police afterward. Two weeks prior, Pham said Myers had walked onto her patio naked from the waist down making obscene gestures in front of her two-year-old son.

Myers was charged with a hate crime in April 2021, but a judge released her without bail on her own recognizance shortly after. Pham and her husband, Bill Healy, filed a civil lawsuit in King County Superior Court in August 2021, claiming Myers violated a no contact order and continued to harass them. The couple alleged that Myers screamed at them outside and drove her car straight at Healy.

Attorneys for Pham and Healy announced the civil settlement at a press conference Thursday.

""I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,"" Pham said, according to KING-TV. ""We hope Jan Myers follow through the agreement and move quickly.""

""That was what made it very difficult, is when I realized my wife and my family, their physical well-being and their life was being threatened by this person,"" Healy said, according to KIRO.

""We need to make the people who are harassing people because of their race pay and make them pay the victim,"" Pham and Healy’s attorney Jeffery Campiche added.

Investigators determined Vowell’s statement to be true after Whitmer initially misled police, saying ""my house just got shot up, my friend got shot in the chest,"" according to affidavits before he called the police. In a later statement, Whitler said Vowell shot Broad Jr., but the evidence did not support this claim, police said.

A New Jersey man has been sentenced to 375 years in jail in the 2016 killing of three people, including two children, and attempted murder of three more after authorities say he became enraged over a Facebook post.

Jeremy Arrington, 31, was convicted last month in Essex County of three counts of murder and attempted murder as well as burglary, criminal restraint and weapons charges. Jurors deliberated for less than two hours before handing down their decision.

SACRAMENTO SHERIFF: DOWNTOWN SHOOTING THAT KILLED SIX IS RESULT OF ‘TREATING CRIMINALS LIKE VICTIMS’

On Friday, Judge Ronald Wigler imposed three consecutive life terms in the killings and consecutive sentences on other counts. Arrington won’t be eligible for parole before serving 281 years of his sentence.

Wigler told the defendant that he had committed ""perhaps the most horrific, heinous, cruel, and depraved murders this county has ever seen.""

Prosecutors said Arrington entered a Newark home in November 2016, tied up the people inside and tortured them. He stabbed them with kitchen knives, killing 8-year-old Aerial Little Whitehurst and 11-year-old Al-Jahon Whitehurst, then shot and killed 23-year-old college student Syasia McBurroughs, who was visiting the family.

The murdered children's mother, a 29-year-old woman and her 13-year-old brother and 13-year-old sister were wounded.

Authorities said Arrington was apparently angry that one of the victims had reposted a Facebook alert from police naming him as a suspect in an earlier shooting and sexual assault.

While Arrington didn’t take the stand at his trial, he read a short statement at his sentencing hearing on Friday, apologizing to the families. He described his actions as ""craziness and uncalled for"" and said he would switch places with the victims if he could, NJ.com reported.

575,Zelenskyy warns UN of more discoveries of alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine,Posted Greg Norman,"Russia repeats dubious Bucha claims in front of UN, says it's not targeting Ukrainian civilians

Vasily Nebenzya, the Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations, claimed to the Security Council Tuesday that reports of alleged atrocities carried out by the Russian military in places like Bucha are “blatant criminally-staged events with Ukrainian civilians who were killed by their own radicals.”

In a message to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Nebenzya said “it turns out that we shouldn’t have withdrawn, I’m talking about Bucha first and foremost.

“I understand that you saw corpses and heard testimonials but you only saw what they showed you,” he continued. “You couldn’t ignore the flagrant inconsistencies in the version of events which are being promoted by Ukrainian and western media.”

Nebenzya also said in his message to Zelenskyy that “I really hope that you will find a solution to the situation because it depends only on you.”

He said Russia “came to Ukraine not to conquer lands, we came to bring the long-awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas.

“Not a truce, but a true, lasting peace and for this we need to root out the cruelty which I mentioned. We need to cut out the malignant Nazi tumor that is consuming Ukraine and would in time begin to consume Russia,” he also said. “And we will achieve that goal I hope sooner rather than later because there is no other outcome.”

Nebenzya also claimed that the Russian military is “not shooting civilian targets in order to save as many civilians as possible -- this is precisely why we are not advancing as fast as many expected.

“We are not acting like Americans and their allies in Iraq and Syria, razing entire cities to the ground,” he said. “They had no pity for them but we felt great pity because these are people who are close to us.""",https://www.foxnews.com

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Saturday that Russian troops are creating a ""catastrophic"" situation for civilians by leaving mines around homes, abandoned equipment and the bodies of those killed.

""It’s still not possible to return to normal life, as it used to be, even at the territories that we are taking back after the fighting,"" the president told his nation in a nightly video message.

""We need to wait until our land is demined, wait till we are able to assure you that there won’t be new shelling,"" he said.

UKRAINE REACTS AFTER RUSSIA ACCUSSES ITS HELICOPTERS OF LAUNCHING AIRSTRIKES ON OIL DEPOT ACROSS THE BORDER

Ukraine and Western allies have reported mounting evidence of Russia withdrawing its forces from around Kyiv and sending troops to eastern Ukraine.

Officials said Ukraine's fighters had reclaimed several areas near its capital city, including the city of Brovary.

However, the shift does not mean the country faces a reprieve from the war.

The New York Times reported Saturday that Russian forces moved to crack down on protesters in the southeastern of city Enerhodar, which is home to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, reported about the attacks on its official Telegram channel, posting an accompanying video clip that featured what appeared to be loud blasts and flying debris.

""As protesters began to disperse, the invaders arrived in police vehicles, and began to force local residents into them,"" the post read. ""A few minutes later, the city was rocked by massive explosions and shelling.""

The agency said four people were injured and received medical assistance.

Energoatom also claimed that Russian forces jammed phone and internet communications throughout Enerhodar, although the agency’s claims could not be immediately verified.

At least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late Friday at the Odesa region – though the Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles did not hit the critical infrastructure they targeted.

ZELENSKYY LAUNCHES MASSIVE EFFORT TO MAKE UKRAINIANS WHOLE AFTER RUSSIAN DESTRUCTION

Zelenskyy said he expected towns to receive airstrikes and shelling from afar and for eastern fighting to be intense.

In Mariupol, a southern port city located in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, the International Committee of the Red Cross planned Saturday to get emergency supplies into the besieged city and evacuate residents.

City authorities said Russians blocked access to the city on Friday and the Red Cross said it was unable to carry out the operation then because it did not receive assurances the route was safe.

About 100,000 people are believed to remain in the city and officials said around 2,000 made it out by themselves on Friday.

While several agreements have been made to allow residents to evacuate – with one reportedly set for ""coming days"" – they have previously been breached.

Residents there are in dire need of water, food, fuel and medicine.

""Europe doesn’t have the right to be silent about what is happening in our Mariupol,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The whole world should respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.""

There was no word Saturday on Friday's round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators.

On Friday, the Kremlin accused Ukraine of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on Russian soil.

Ukraine has denied responsibility for the Belgorod blast and Zelenskyy would not tell Fox News' Bret Baier if Ukraine was behind the attack in an interview on ""Special Report.""

The U.S. Department of Defense said Friday that it would provide an additional $300 million in arms to Ukrainian forces.

584,"US calls out 'credible reports' of Putin's forces herding Ukrainians to 'filtration camps,' then into Russia",Danielle Wallace,"

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations highlighted Tuesday what she deemed as ""credible reports"" about Russian forces abducting tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, confiscating passports and interrogating people in so-called ""filtration camps"" and then forcibly relocating them to Russia.

The remarks from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking remotely from Ukraine, addressed the U.N. Security Council. He called for Russian troops to be brought up on war crime charges for atrocities uncovered in Bucha and around Kyiv before a tribunal similar to the one set up at Nuremberg after World War II

""We've all seen the gruesome photos, lifeless bodies lying in the streets, apparently summarily executed, their hands tied behind their backs,"" Thomas-Greenfield said, referring to images surfacing from the Bucha massacre after Russian forces pulled back from the capital region in recent days.

Recognizing how Zelenskyy has claimed children were being abducted by Russian troops, Thomas-Greenfield also acknowledged how Ukrainian mayors, doctors, religious leaders, journalists and ""all who dared defy"" Russia’s aggression"" have too been kidnapped since the onset of the war on Feb. 24.

""Some of them, according to credible reports, including by the Mariupol City Council, have been taken to so-called filtration camps, where Russian forces are reportedly making tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens relocate to Russia,"" the ambassador said. ""Reports indicate that Russian federal security agents are confiscating passports and IDs, taking away cellphones and separating families from one another.""

""I do not need to spell out what these so-called filtration camps are reminiscent of. It’s chilling, and we cannot look away,"" she said, appearing to reference Nazi-era concentration camps without evoking the regime’s name. ""Every day we see more and more how little Russia respects human rights. And that is why I announced yesterday that the United States, in coordination with Ukraine and many other U.N. member states, will seek Russia's suspension from the U.N. Human Rights Council.""

Last week, Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s ombudsperson, claimed that 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, has been relocated against their will to Russia. The Kremlin gave a near exact count of people but claimed that those individuals from the badly bombarded Mariupol and Moscow-allegiant breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine elected to go to Russia to escape the fighting, according to Time.

Her remarks echoed what U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday about how Russia is running a ""deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.""

Zelenskyy, who previously said more than 300 people were tortured and killed in Bucha alone, spelled out Tuesday how ""civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,"" ""women were raped and killed in front of their children,"" and equated Russian aggressors to ""terrorists"" occupying other territories for cutting out the tongues of Ukrainian civilians who opposed them.

On Monday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the mayor of Motyzhyn, a village outside of Kyiv, Olga Sukhenko, was killed by Russian captors alongside her husband and son. Their bodies were reportedly found in a shallow grave in a forest near homes used as makeshift Russian barracks. Vereshchuk said 11 other Ukrainian mayors and community heads are in Russian captivity.

Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko on Tuesday highlighted how the United Nations declared that Ukraine is the most mine-infested country in the world as over a million people live around land rigged with explosives. Reports said Russian soldiers had rigged at least some of the bodies of Ukrainian civilians they killed with explosives to evoke more tragedy as people recover the dead from shallow graves.

Thomas-Greenfield, who returned Monday from a trip visiting Ukrainian refugees in Moldova and Romania, shared three stories of the more than 10 million people – six million who’ve been internally displaced, and four million who’ve fled Ukraine – during the conflict spanning for over 40 days.

The ambassador shared the story of one young woman who fled with her 6-year-old brother who has autism and is sick with cancer, remarking how ""Russia's war has interrupted the care her brother desperately needs."" Another woman, Thomas-Greenfield said, fled with her 8-year-old child from Odessa, leaving behind the child’s father, who told them shelling later struck next to their apartment. A third woman told the ambassador she loved to travel but never thought her next trip would be to ""flee for her life,"" breaking down in tears as she wondered if she would be able to return home to Kyiv.

More disturbing photos are surfacing showing the massacre of civilians in and around Bucha, outside the capital of Kyiv, Ukraine, as Russian forces are reportedly regrouping in the southeast to renew their offensive against the already badly bombarded Mariupol, as well as the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

In an overnight address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 300 people had been tortured and killed in Bucha, as satellite imagery seemed to back up Ukrainian claims about Russian soldiers shooting and killing civilians left lying in the streets and outside homes.

The Kremlin has claimed that the bodies were staged after Russian soldiers pulled back from the capital region, allegations Ukraine and the West say is misinformation meant to displace blame for such war crimes.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government is pouring soldiers into Ukraine’s east to gain control of the industrial heartland known as the Donbas. That follows a Russian withdrawal from towns around the capital, Kyiv, which led to the discovery of corpses and prompted accusations of war crimes and demands for tougher sanctions on Moscow.

Russian news agency Interfax said discussions between Ukrainian and Russian officials are continuing via video link Tuesday, citing a deputy Russian foreign minister.

Russian forces are focused on seizing the cities of Popasna and Rubizhne in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and the Black Sea port of Mariupol, Ukraine's General Staff said on its Facebook page. Donetsk and Luhansk are controlled by Russian-backed separatists and recognized by Moscow as independent states. The General Staff said access to Kharkiv in the east, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was blocked.

After touring neighborhoods of Bucha and speaking to hungry survivors lining up for bread, Zelenskyy pledged in a video address that Ukraine would work with the European Union and the International Criminal Court to identify Russian fighters involved in any atrocities.

""The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who among their fellow citizens killed, who gave orders, who turned a blind eye to the murders,"" he said.

Among the dead was the mayor of the village of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, her husband and her adult son, whose tortured bodies were found in a shallow grave on a plot of land near houses used as makeshift barracks by occupying Russian troops, according to Ukrainian officials. The three of them reportedly had been kidnaped by Russian forces days before.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a ""stage-managed anti-Russian provocation."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the images contained ""signs of video forgery and various fakes."" Russia has rejected previous allegations of atrocities as fabrications by Ukraine.

In an initial count Sunday, Ukrainian prosecutor-general’s office said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces, describing one room discovered in Bucha as a ""torture chamber."" In a statement, it said the bodies of five men with their hands bound were found in the basement of a children’s sanatorium where civilians were tortured and killed.

The bodies seen by AP journalists in Bucha included at least 13 in and around a building that local people said Russian troops used as a base. Three other bodies were found in a stairwell, and a group of six were burned together.

The dead witnessed by the news agency's journalists also included bodies wrapped in black plastic, piled on one end of a mass grave in a Bucha churchyard. Many of those victims had been shot in cars or killed in explosions trying to flee the city.

According to the indictment, from 2019 through 2021, Benjamin carried out the scheme while he was a state senator and a candidate for state comptroller. During that time, Benjamin allegedly solicited campaign donations from and to be raised by a real estate developer, in exchange for appropriating state funds for the developer’s non-profit organization.

A manhunt is underway in New York City for a suspect accused of donning a gas mask, setting off a smoke canister and opening fire inside a Brooklyn subway train and station during the morning commute Tuesday, injuring at least 29 people, five of whom are in critical condition.

Police identified a person of interest in the shooting as Frank James. They said he has addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia but his ties to New York City weren't immediately clear.

""We are looking to determine if he has any connection to the attack,"" NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said.

A $50,000 reward is being offered for information regarding the shooting.

The attack began around 8:24 a.m., as a Manhattan-bound N train approached the 36th St. station in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The suspect, described as an approximately 5-foot-5 Black male with a heavy build, is still at large and is ""dangerous,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters nearly four hours after the shooting.

The suspect's shots struck multiple people on the subway car and on the platform, New York Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said. He was wearing a green ""construction type"" vest and a hooded gray sweatshirt. The suspect has not been identified by authorities, Sewell said.

Sewell said there are currently no known explosive devices on New York City subway trains and the incident is not being investigated as a terrorism incident at this time. She said no one had life-threatening injuries.

FDNY acting Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said 16 people were injured in the incident, 10 of whom are suffering from gunshot wounds, and five of whom are in critical condition at local hospitals.

After the press conference, Fox News learned that NYU Langone is treating a total of 20 patients in connection to the Brooklyn subway incident, up from the initial eight first reported at that hospital.

All 20 were in stable condition, and the nature of the injuries varied from gunshot wounds to smoke inhalation, the hospital said, without disclosing how many had been shot.

NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital said it is currently treating a total of three patients from the subway attack; one for a gunshot injury, another for a fracture, and the third is non-trauma-related. All three patients are in stable condition. At Maimonides Health in Brooklyn, there are five victims; three being treated for smoke inhalation and two with either shrapnel or gunshot wounds.

""This individual is still on the loose,"" Hochul said. ""We’re asking individuals to be very vigilant and alert. This is an active shooter situation right now in the city of New York.""

""We say no more, no more mass shootings. No more disrupting lives,"" the governor continued. ""No more creating heartbreak for people just trying to live their lives as normal New Yorkers. It has to end. It ends now. And we are sick and tired of reading headlines about crime.""

Subway service was not suspended citywide after the incident, even as the suspect remains at large.

MTA CEO Janno Lieber said that although the system is disrupted, it is still running. B and W services are suspended, and D and N lines also have suspensions, with shuttle buses operating.

""I just want to say one thing on a personal note, which is on 9/11, I stood on Fourth Avenue and watched people, New Yorkers come back from that tragedy,"" Lieber said. ""And I watched New Yorkers help each other and storekeepers walked out and give people water. That was the same thing we saw in the platform today. We saw New Yorkers in a difficult situation, an emergency helping each other.""

Sewell said, ""There are currently no known explosive devices"" on the subway system, after the FDNY reportedly found several ""undetonated devices"" at the subway station.

Police scoured the city for the shooter and found a U-Haul in the Gravesend neighborhood with an Arizona license plate possibly connected to the shooting. The van was found just over five miles from the 36th St. station.

A U-Haul spokesperson told Fox News that the company has been alerted by law enforcement of their search for a rental van.

""We are working closely with authorities to ensure they have any and all available information to meet their needs,"" U-Haul said

A senior law enforcement source later confirmed reports to Fox News that a handgun with an extended magazine was found at the scene. The source further identified the handgun as a Glock and said it was discovered inside the train where shots were fired.

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES

New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was not in-person at the Brooklyn press conference as he recovers from the coronavirus, appeared virtually on CNN afterward, reiterating that investigators do not have a positive identification of the suspect at this time. He also responded to how Sewell noted how the incident is not being considered terror-related at this point.

""It's a preliminary investigation. This is terror of someone attempted to terrorize our system,"" Adams told CNN host Dana Bash. ""They brought in what appears to be some form of smoke device. They discharged a weapon. And so, I don't want to be premature in justifying that this was/ was not. I think at this time, the investigators are going to do their due diligence to properly identify what happened here. And so, I think at this time, it's premature to say exactly, what happened here is still new.""

NYPD Counterterrorism units responded to the scene, while additional units, including police K9s and heavy weaponry, have been deployed to subway stations around New York City, a high-ranking law enforcement source told Fox News Digital.

The Department of Education confirmed that schools nearby were sheltering in place. New York City Schools Chancellor David C. Banks said later in the afternoon that dismissals had been completed without incident across all impacted schools.

A graphic photo circulated on Twitter Tuesday morning showing several people lying on the blood-soaked floor of the station. One man applied pressure to what appeared to be another man’s leg wound. A red item of clothing was tied around the wound to slow bleeding. A puddle of blood was seen next to a second man grasping his cellphone, as backpacks and purses were strewn across the platform.

Another unverified video shared on social media appeared to be recorded by someone riding a train into the station. Crowds rushed out once the doors opened, and smoke is seen billowing through the station.

The NYPD Transit Bureau struck down reports that subway trains were stuck between stations.

""While there are several subways service changes, reports of trains currently stopped in tunnels are not accurate,"" the bureau tweeted at 10:23 a.m. ET. ""All subway trains have been moved into stations. Officers are currently inspecting all stations and trains as we continue to investigate the incident at 36th St in BK.""

591,"Miami Instagram model not charged in boyfriend's death 'because of her privilege,' brother alleges",Michael Ruiz,"

The family of slain Miami 27-year-old Christian Tobechukwu ""Toby"" Obumseli is demanding justice and claiming police had declined to charge his Instagram model girlfriend, Courtney Clenney, because of ""privilege,"" not her claim of self-defense in a domestic violence incident that ended in his fatal stabbing.

Her attorney, meanwhile, doubled down on his self-defense argument and told Fox News Digital Monday that ""justice in this case demands that Courtney does not face any charges.""

""Courtney still has yet to explain exactly what happened leading up to Toby’s murder"" Jeffrey Obumseli, the slain man’s brother, wrote on Instagram. ""We have every reason to believe that his death was the result of unwarranted and unprovoked violence. We want to see that justice is served.""

FLORIDA MODEL COURTNEY CLENNEY SPOTTED IN MIAMI HOTEL WITH FATHER AFTER BOYFRIEND'S STABBING DEATH

Clenney, an Instagram and OnlyFans model who uses the name Courtney Tailor online, was caught on video covered in blood on her luxury high-rise balcony after the incident but has not been charged. TMZ obtained and published the images last week.

""The bottom line is inextricably clear: Courtney is being treated differently because of her privilege as a wealthy White woman,"" Jeffrey Obumseli wrote on Instagram. ""Within 24 hours following Toby’s death, the detective on the case prematurely concluded this was not a crime of violence.""

He also condemned a series of resurfaced, old tweets from his brother and said that they had nothing to do with his death. He alleged that Clenney did not suffer any injuries to support her claim of self-defense.

FLORIDA MAN DEAD, MODEL LOVER FOUND SOAKED IN BLOOD

But Clenney, through her attorney, is pushing back against the statements from Obumseli’s family that he was a victim of ""murder"" and she was receiving special treatment.

""Courtney was not arrested because it is a clear she was defending herself and was the victim of domestic violence,"" her attorney, Frank Prieto, told Fox News Digital Monday. ""As a former prosecutor with the Miami [State Attorney’s Office], the fact she has not been arrested or charged is indicative that the investigation has concluded she acted in self-defense.""

He said his client was cooperating with investigators.

""Mr. Obumseli was mentally, emotionally, and physically abusive with Courtney,"" Prieto told Fox News Digital. ""That tragic night, there was a physical altercation and Courtney had no choice but to defend herself.""

""We understand the family wants ‘justice,’ but justice, in this case, demands that Courtney does not face any charges,"" he added. ""This is not a case about White or wealthy privilege; this is a case of self-defense by a victim of domestic violence.""

FLORIDA MOM, BIKINI MODEL, DEFENDS FAMILY IN GUNFIGHT DURING ARMED HOME INVASION

Jeffrey Obumseli did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital requests for comment. Neither did attorneys representing his family.

In his Instagram post, he slammed Clenney for a pair of videos that emerged following the incident, one showing her covered in blood and another showing her leaving a Miami hotel lobby when confronted on camera.

""We’ve seen videos of Courtney kissing her dogs while covered in what we believe to be my brother’s blood and casually getting drinks at a hotel bar days later while my brother lays in the morgue,"" he wrote.

Clenney was filmed at Miami’s Grand Beach hotel Friday, days after her boyfriend’s death, but she got up and left after the person holding the camera confronted her.

""The statement about Courtney ‘casually getting drinks’ is absolutely false,"" Prieto said. ""Courtney was not ‘casually getting drinks at a hotel bar.’ Courtney was sitting at an unattended table in the hotel lobby area that also has a bar.""

Her father, in town to ""be with his grieving daughter,"" had ordered a drink for himself, Prieto said.

""They left because the woman was berating them for no reason,"" he added. ""It’s a shame that a member of the public would confront them without knowing the facts of what occurred that evening.""

The Miami-based WPLG 10 reported Friday that friends of the couple described ""a very rocky relationship"" — although the sources gave conflicting stories about who might have been the aggressor. The couple reportedly broke up last month, according to the Miami Herald , and Obumseli allegedly began sleeping in the building’s common areas.

Then on April 1, Miami police were dispatched to their apartment for a separate domestic call, the paper reported, citing local law enforcement sources. The officers found bruises on Clenney’s arms and legs, but no one was arrested.

Despite the lack of charges following his brother's death, Obsumeli described it as a ""murder"" and claimed that a ""lack of transparency"" surrounding the case ""strongly suggests foul play is involved.""

Miami police have released few details so far. They said Obsumseli suffered ""an apparent knife wound"" to the chest as the result of a domestic dispute on Sunday, April 3, at the couple’s luxury apartment. First responders rushed him to the nearby Jackson Memorial Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.

Police did not identify Clenney in their official statement Thursday, stating only that ""a female was located on scene and interviewed by detectives and that ""the preliminary investigation determined that both Mr. Obumseli and the female had been involved in a physical altercation.""

A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that Clenney was taken to a hospital under the Baker Act for a mental health evaluation after the incident. Under the law, details about such hospitalizations are confidential.

592,Transgender woman's op-ed regretting sex re-assignment surgery draws strong media reaction: 'Heartbreaking',Brandon Gillespie,"

A transgender woman who had sex re-assignment surgery as a teenager is warning those considering a similar operation to explore the world inhabiting their body ""as it is"" before ""permanently altering"" it.

In a Monday op-ed for The Washington Post headlined, ""What I wish I'd known when I was 19 and had sex re-assignment surgery,"" software developer Corinna Cohn expressed regret over her transition from being a man to a woman, explaining she wasn't old enough to make such a drastic decision and that it committed her ""to a lifetime apart"" from her peers.

""When I was 19, I had surgery for sex reassignment, or what is now called gender affirmation surgery,"" Cohn wrote. ""In terms of my priorities and interests today, that younger incarnation of myself might as well have been a different person — yet that was the person who committed me to a lifetime set apart from my peers.""

""There is much debate today about transgender treatment, especially for young people. Others might feel differently about their choices, but I know now that I wasn’t old enough to make that decision,"" she added. ""Given the strong cultural forces today casting a benign light on these matters, I thought it might be helpful for young people, and their parents, to hear what I wish I had known.""

ALABAMA DOCTORS, PARENTS OF TRANSGENDER KIDS SUE TO BLOCK LAW BANNING CROSS-SEX HORMONES FOR CHILDREN

Cohn explained she once believed she would be more successful finding love as a woman considering she was interested in men; however, she found that ""few straight men are interested in having a physical relationship with a person who was born the same sex as them.""

She described experiencing gender dysphoria as a teenager, as well as anxiety and depression, and that she wasn't prepared for puberty or the strong sex drive typical of a male teen.

""Surgery unshackled me from my body’s urges, but the destruction of my gonads introduced a different type of bondage. From the day of my surgery, I became a medical patient and will remain one for the rest of my life,"" Cohn wrote, explaining the choice between the health risks of taking exogenous estrogen or taking nothing.

DISNEY HEIR COMES OUT AS TRANSGENDER, CRITICIZES FLORIDA EDUCATION LAW

She also described how she had pushed her parents out of her life before making the decision to have the surgery, leaving her to only feel validated by people she met on the internet who were ""like-minded.""

""I shudder to think of how distorting today’s social media is for confused teenagers. I’m also alarmed by how readily authority figures facilitate transition,"" Cohn wrote, explaining that years ago she had to persuade therapists, an endocrinologist and a surgeon to take her through the process.

She explained that she was still working out how much regret she should feel, considering if she hadn't made the transition she would have dealt with separate challenges. She added that she was ""comfortable with the ambiguity.""

""What advice would I pass on to young people seeking transition? … The prospect of sex can be intimidating. But sex is essential in healthy relationships. Give it a chance before permanently altering your body,"" Cohn wrote.

""Most of all, slow down. You may yet decide to make the change. But if you explore the world by inhabiting your body as it is, perhaps you’ll find that you love it more than you thought possible,"" she added.

Some people reacted positively to the piece, praising The Post for publishing it. Others accused the liberal paper of taking the side of ""far-right bigots.""

""It takes real courage to put yourself out there like this. I am shocked WaPo published this story, because it goes against the Narrative, but it’s very important,"" outspoken Ron DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw wrote.

""This is heartbreaking, but extremely important. Bravo to the Washington Post for publishing it,"" wrote journalist Bari Weiss, while radio personality Michael Yafee tweeted, ""A great piece from the [Washington Post] of all places. Unfortunately there'll be a lot more people like this in our future who will regret that decision. Protecting kids from the madness IS NOT BIGOTED.""

""Many people regret the major life choices they make at nineteen, but this was particularly hard to read,"" the Washington Post's Megan McArdle tweeted.

Transgender activist Morgan Artyukhina, however, blasted The Post for publishing the piece while calling Cohn ""a bitter older trans woman.""

""WaPo bravely publishes another op-ed by a bitter older trans woman taking the side of far-right bigots banning affirming healthcare for trans youth, comparing it to ‘fad diets’... ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness’ but trans kids die on the [Post Opinions] page,"" Artyukhina wrote.",https://www.foxnews.com
593,"Southwest Airlines passenger masturbates 4 times mid-flight, calls it 'kind of kinky': Feds",Stephanie Pagones,"

A nightmare passenger aboard a Southwest Airlines flight is banned from the airline for life after authorities say he pleasured himself four times with his genitals out in front of other passengers during a trip from Washington to Arizona. Authorities added that he said he thought it was ""kind of kinky"" that a woman next to him did not appear to be uncomfortable with it, according to court papers and officials.

Antonio Sherrodd McGarity is accused of committing ""lewd, indecent or obscene acts"" while aboard the nearly three-hour flight on Saturday, according to a federal criminal complaint later made public. According to court documents, McGarity was sitting in seat 11F of Southwest Airlines’ Flight 3814 from Seattle, Washington, to Phoenix, Arizona, when he ""exposed his penis and masturbated while in view of the female passenger sitting next to him.""

His attorney, federal public defender Madeline Mayer, told Fox News Digital she looks forward to McGarity's day in court.

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAIN GRAPHIC DETAILS

""Due process is the cornerstone of our legal system,"" she wrote in an email Tuesday. ""This process ensures that Mr. McGarity’s constitutional rights are protected.""

Seated next to a woman, McGarity allegedly waited until the flight had taken off before he lowered his pants and shorts and began pleasuring himself with his genitalia exposed. The woman seated in seat 11E snapped photos of some explicit acts, and later complained and was ultimately moved to a different seat on the plane.

She later told Phoenix Police Department McGarity masturbated ""on four separate occasions, using both his left and right hands,"" court papers state.

A Southwest Airlines spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Tuesday crew members stepped in as soon as they learned what was happening, and the caption requested law enforcement meet the plane upon its arrival.

""We immediately placed the passenger who exhibited the lewd behavior on our No-Fly List, resulting in a lifetime ban from traveling on Southwest Airlines,"" the spokesperson wrote.

The FBI later interviewed McGarity, when he admitted to the lewd behavior and said he had reached orgasm. He went on to say he knew the woman was aware of what he was doing and could see his genitals, and added that he also knew she photographed his alleged acts, the complaint states.

594,New York City subway shooting attack timeline,Michael Ruiz,"

Frank R. James, the 62-year-old man accused of popping a smoke canister in a crowded New York City subway car before opening fire during the Tuesday morning rush hour, is in police custody after a good Samaritan spotted him walking down a Manhattan sidewalk in broad daylight Wednesday.

In 30 hours between the attack and his arrest, investigators obtained and distributed images of the suspect in the hope that the public could help catch him. They searched a storage unit and apartment linked to him in Philadelphia, which he had spoken of in numerous videos posted to a now-disabled YouTube channel. Then he was spotted wandering around Manhattan and may have taunted investigators by calling in the tip line to report himself, according to law enforcement sources, even as a security camera technician spotted him in the East Village and turned him in.

BROOKLYN SUBWAY SHOOTING: LIVE UPDATES

MONDAY APRIL 11

Police say James rented a U-Haul van in Philadelphia.

He had reserved it and prepaid on April 6, according to a federal criminal complaint, using his Wisconsin driver’s license, as a well as a phone number linked to bank cards in his name that investigators would later find at the scene of the shooting.

Then he drove to New York City.

TUESDAY APRIL 12

At 4:11 a.m., surveillance cameras captured him driving the rented Chevrolet on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, a span that connects Staten Island to Brooklyn.

At 6:12 a.m., another camera spotted the van at West Seventh Street and Kings Highway in Brooklyn, near where police later recovered the vehicle.

The camera recorded ""an individual wearing a yellow hard hat, orange working jacket with reflective tape, carrying a backpack in his right hand and dragging a rolling bag in his left hand, leaving the U-Haul vehicle on foot.""

At around 8:25 a.m., James, wearing a gas mask and bright nylon safety vest, allegedly boarded a Manhattan-bound N train near where he left the van, activated a canister of smoke and opened fire just before it pulled into the 36th Street station in Sunset Park.

At 8:40 a.m., another surveillance camera captured a man investigators believe is James exciting another N train station at 25th Street. At this point, the vest, mask and hardhat seen in earlier images is gone, but police say the face appears to match his Wisconsin driver’s license photo.

Bystander video shows the train’s doors billowing smoke after they opened. Passengers flooded out in a panic, fleeing the mayhem. At least 29 people were injured, including 10 with gunshot wounds. Five were critically injured, according to authorities.

Police found two bags at the scene. One contained a Glock 17, a gas can, a torch, the key to a U-Haul vehicle and bank cards, according to a federal criminal complaint. The other contained commercial fireworks.

Also left behind was the safety vest.

Police said the pistol had been legally purchased in Ohio in 2011 by Frank Robert James. But ""an attempt was made to deface the serial number."" The bank cards had James’ name on them as well, and investigators said records that U-Haul provided showed James had rented a van in Philadelphia Monday with Arizona plates. They found it abandoned on Kings Highway and later found it on surveillance video showing it crossed the Verrazano Narrows Bridge about four hours before the shooting.

They also said they found a receipt for a storage unit in Philadelphia – where investigators said they found 9 mm and .223 caliber ammunition, targets and a threaded pistol barrel, according to the complaint.

WEDNESDAY APRIL 13

A Twitter user identifying as Jack Griffin shared two images of a ""possible frank james sighting"" around 10:30 a.m., showing a heavyset man matching James' description walking on a Lower East Side sidewalk and sitting at an outdoor dining area.

NYPD Crime Stoppers replied and ask for more information. ""Canal street [in front] of ceros,"" Griffin replied.

Finally, police from the NYPD’s 9th Precinct arrested James Tuesday afternoon in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan after receiving reports of sightings in the area.

Zak Dahhan, 21, told Fox News he was performing maintenance on a store’s security cameras when he saw James walking down the street with a bag over his shoulder.

Police also said that a tipster had called in a sighting of James at a nearby McDonald’s restaurant, and responding officers arrived but did not find him there.

Law enforcement sources separately told Fox News Digital that James had reported himself to the Crime Stoppers hotline before his arrest.

Police caught up with James nearby outside a liquor store, where images show officers leading away the suspect, who was wearing dark pants, a navy blue T-shirt and black flat-brimmed hat.

NYC SUBWAY SHOOTING: MAN WHO ALERTED POLICE TO SUSPECT REVEALS MOMENTS BEFORE ARREST

""We got him,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams declared during an afternoon news conference.

THURSDAY APRIL 14

James made his first appearance in federal court in Brooklyn.

His defense attorney Mia Eisner-Grynberg, a federal public defender, said her client called police on himself ""to help.""

""What happened in the New York City subway system on Tuesday was a tragedy,"" she said. ""It is a blessing that it was not worse.""

She urged against a ""rush to judgment"" and said James called police after he saw his photograph on the news.

""He called Crime Stoppers to help,"" she said. ""He told them where he was. Initial press and police reports in cases like this one are often inaccurate. Mr. James is entitled to a fair trial, and we will ensure that he receives one.""

Magistrate Judge Roanne Mann ordered James held in permanent detention pending any future bail applications.

James, whose record contains misdemeanors including stealing, tampering and criminal sex acts stretching back to the early 1990s, is expected to face federal terror charges in connection with the attack on mass transit, according to Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

For years before the attack, he posted offensive and incendiary videos to a barely viewed YouTube channel that surged in views Tuesday after police named him a person of interest.

He titled them with phrases including "" DOMESTICATED AVERAGES "" and "" SENSIBLE VIOLENCE ,"" and posted hour-long, profanity-laced rants. The banner image showed an alarm clock reading ""Too Late.""

Police even used a still image from one of the videos when they blasted out his face to the public for help solving the case.

A March 1 video began with a local television news report about rising violence in New York City’s subways. In it, he went on to criticize Mayor Adams, women, social workers and homeless people.

""I wanted to kill everything in sight,"" he says about 12 minutes into the video. ""I was planning to kill everything I saw.""

In an about-face move the Biden administration on Wednesday decided against providing Ukraine with Mi-17 helicopters despite informing Congress of its intention to do so a day prior, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.

The shipment of helicopters was considered Tuesday as part of a new $750 million aid package to Ukraine as it braces for a major offensive in its most eastern regions by Russian forces.

The Mi-17 is a Soviet-era helicopter designed in the mid-1970s which was previously relied on by Afghan forces and can be used in an aggressive capacity.

UKRAINE NOT GETTING WHAT IT NEEDS TO 'END WAR SOONER,' RUNNING OUT OF 'TIME' AND 'LIVES': ZELENSKYY

White House press secretary Jen Psaki first announced the U.S.’s intent to send Ukraine Mi-17s in the lead up to the Russian invasion in January, though Fox News could not immediately confirm if this shipment was sent.

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News’ questions on what other equipment will be provided to Ukraine in lieu of the Mi-17s.

The administration has provided Kyiv with more than $1.7 billion in security assistance since Feb. 24, and the White House is expected to announce its latest package this week, first reported Reuters.

The U.S. has sent a litany of defensive equipment including shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, Stinger anti-aircraft systems, Javelin missiles, light anti-armor weapons, anti-armor systems and tactical unmanned aerial systems – including Switchblade drones armed with tank-busting warheads.

597,Stepmom of ex-Atlanta cop Garrett Rolfe 'stunned' by firing after Rayshard Brooks shooting,Marisa Schultz,"

Melissa Rolfe says she was fired from her job in a ""political move"" because her stepson is ex-Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe.

In an interview Tuesday with Fox News, Melissa Rolfe spoke in detail about what happened after Garrett Rolfe was criminally charged for the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks on June 12 -- which fueled protests against police brutality that already were erupting over the death of George Floyd. Apart from the ongoing criminal case, Melissa Rolfe lost her job on June 18 as the human resources director of Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta. While the company has said this was due to creating ""a hostile work environment,"" Melissa Rolfe maintains she was fired because of her relationship to her stepson.

""It was a political move,"" said Rolfe, who has firmly stood by her stepson and said the ""war on police officers"" must end.

Melissa Rolfe started at Equity Prime Morgage in Atlanta in February as the human resources director for the company's nearly 400 nationwide employees, she said.

Immediately after Brooks' death, which garnered national attention and sparked more outcry from Black Lives Matter activists, Rolfe was assured she had the company's support. Equity Prime Mortgage's president Eddy Perez called and offered Rolfe six to eight weeks of paid time off so she could be with her family, Rolfe said.

""I offered to work from home and he said 'no, no don't worry about it. Your job is safe,'"" Rolfe said. ""'Don't worry about anything...Just take care of your family.""

RAYSHARD BROOKS KILLING: FORMER ATLANTA OFFICER GARRETT ROLFE CHARGED WITH MURDER, COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY

But the company support quickly evaporated on June 18, a day after a Georgia District attorney slapped Garrett Rolfe with 11 charges, including felony murder, which could potentially lead to the death penalty. (A second officer, Devin Brosnan, is facing three charges, including aggravated assault.)

After Melissa Rolfe and her husband had just dropped off their son at the attorney's office to turn himself into the authorities, Melissa had a 56-second call with her direct manager. Equity Prime Mortgage was terminating her immediately and didn't provide any reason. Her boss offered to pack up and ship her belongings from her office in Atlanta and then the conversation abruptly ended, she said.

As Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" reported June 19 about her abrupt dismissal, Equity Prime Mortgage put out a statement of reasons for the firing that shocked Melissa Rolfe.

STEPMOTHER OF ATLANTA COP IN RAYSHARD BROOKS SHOOTING FIRED FROM HER JOB

Equity said Rolfe was sacked for violating company policy and creating an uncomfortable working environment for fellow employees. The company said it values “diversity of thought” but “when those views create a hostile working environment, we must make difficult decisions and part ways.”

Rolfe was ""stunned"" at the allegation, especially since she hadn't been in the office since Brooks' death. And as the HR director, she's well versed on company policies and maintains she did nothing improper.

""It was such false statements about me. Nothing was true,"" Rolfe said.

""When I would speak with my direct manager and with the president, I was being assured that everything was fine in the office, continually through the phone calls and text messages that I was receiving,"" Rolfe said. ""Everything's fine. My job was fine. Don't worry about it. We're not getting any negative feedback. So I was very surprised at how I was able to create a hostile work environment. I hadn't been back.""

CALLS FOR 'GUARDRAILS' ON POLICE UNION COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROW AMID REFORM DEMANDS

Equity Prime Mortgage told Fox News Tuesday ""we have no further comment on the matter.""

Rolfe was an at-will employee. A lawyer for Rolfe said Equity Prime Mortgage had a right under Georgia law to terminate her at any time, even if it was for the arbitrary reason she is Garrett Rolfe's stepmom. But they intend to file a lawsuit against the company alleging they defamed her by putting out a false statement to the public about her termination.

Rolfe suspects the company may have targeted her for Facebook postings where she stood by Garrett and reached out to a local politician, Marjorie Greene, who has been outspoken on backing the blue.

On Melissa's Facebook page she's posted pictures and notes backing her son's innocence and standing up for police officers, which have been the target of nationwide protests in the wake of Floyd's death.

Rolfe has posted pictures of Garrett in uniform saying ""I stand with Officer Rolfe"" and promoted the Georgia Law Enforcement Organization's fundraising page for Garrett's legal defense fund, which calls the shooting ""justified."" On the afternoon of June 18, she spoke out in support of the wave of officers calling out sick in the Atlanta Police Department, saying ""Blue Flu must continue and grow until Officer Garrett Rolfe is released on bond!!""

Rolfe also reached out to Greene, who is vying to become the next congresswoman for Georgia's 14th Congressional District. ""Our family has been completely devastated by all of this nonsense,"" Rolfe wrote in thanking Greene for her pro-law enforcement positions.

Rolfe says nothing she did was a fireable offense and has not gotten any guidance from her former employer about what exactly they had an issue with.

""We've heard rumors that it was due to a Facebook post,"" Rolfe said. ""We heard the rumor that it was because I reached out to our future Congresswoman Marjorie Greene, which I absolutely have the right to do. But again, they've not said anything so I don't know what their exact position is.""

The company president, Perez, told Rolfe that some of the security guards in the Atlanta office were upset with her and were making statements, she said.

""Supposedly the statement was 'did you know your HR director's son killed one of our brothers,'"" Rolfe said the president told her. ""I was flabbergasted.""

Though she lost her job, Rolfe said her husband still has full-time employment and they've been fortunate to have gotten donations to cover Garrett's legal defense fund.

She said she would like to work again in HR, but has no interest in going back to Equity Prime Mortgage because of how they treated her.

""I do not want that job back,"" Rolfe said. ""I've lost total confidence with that company. I wouldn't feel safe at that company anymore. They have completely defamed me.""

Police body-camera video showed Brooks, 27, and officers having a calm and cooperative conversation for more than 40 minutes. A struggle erupted when police tried to handcuff Brooks for being intoxicated behind the wheel of his car at a Wendy’s drive-thru. Brooks grabbed a stun gun from one of the officers and fired it in their direction as he tried to flee. Rolfe, in pursuit, opened fire with a handgun. Brooks died after he was shot twice in the back.

In announcing the charges for the officers earlier this month, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. said investigators reviewed numerous videos of the incident.

""We've concluded, at the time Mr. Brooks was shot, that he did not pose an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or officers,"" Howard said at the news conference.

Lawyers for Rolfe said he used permissible force as he feared for his safety and those of the civilians around him.

Melissa Rolfe said she's focused now on proving her stepson's innocence. Garrett's charges came in the wake of nationwide disgust with then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was videotaped kneeling on Floyd's neck. Activists took to the streets demanding racial justice and defunding the police. Politicians have come under pressure to act.

Rolfe said her son is being unfairly lumped into the same category as Chauvin, even though the circumstances are different.

'FED UP' POLICE RALLY BEHIND THEIR OWN IN FACE OF POST-GEORGE FLOYD SCRUTINY

""I would say withhold your judgment...Let the truth come out,"" said Rolfe, who believes Garrett will eventually be exonerated.

""I feel like it was bad timing all the way around,"" Rolfe said, citing the unrest and protests in Atlanta and nationwide. ""We have a horrible war on police officers, and it needs to end.""

She urges people to stand with the police, thank them for their service and buy them a meal if they can.

""We're trying to pass that along because this movement is so much bigger than just Garrett,"" Rolfe said. ""We would really like to get the word out to say thank you to a police officer.""

598,Hungary's Viktor Orban tells Tucker Carlson: 'Western liberals can't accept' right-wing dissent,Charles Creitz,"

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a prominent right-wing voice in Central Europe, fired back at U.S. President Joe Biden for his remark on the campaign trail that grouped the leader in with autocratic strongmen like Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

During a town hall in 2020, Biden accused then-President Donald Trump of palling around with ""all the thugs in the world"":

""You see what’s happening from Belarus through Poland and Hungary and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world"", Biden said at the time. ""Our current president supports all the thugs in the world.""

Biden's 2020 opponent, Trump, was notably close with Orban – as the left-leaning Brookings Institution claimed that the then-president's hosting of Poland's Andrzej Duda was essentially helping him in his reelection bid against a left-leaning Warsaw mayor.

Orban – speaking with ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Thursday -- was the first European leader to endorse Trump's reelection bid, while Trump lauded Orban's border security and counterterrorism policies, as well as endeavors to ""protect and help Christian communities"" throughout the world.

The Hungarian prime minister told Carlson that Biden has ""limited knowledge"" of his country, and therefore cannot understand the issues at hand when he makes such remarks.

""Somebody who does not speak our language has a very limited knowledge on Hungary, even in the recent several decades of our life, not understanding of obviously having an opinion like that,"" he said. ""You know, it's by itself, it's a personal insult for all the Hungarians.""

Orban spoke to the broader political issue, in that left-wing politicians like Biden cannot fathom a nationalistic or conservative alternative ideology, calling Hungary a ""success story.""

""The Western liberals cannot accept that inside the Western civilization, there is a conservative national alternative which is more successful at everyday life, at the level of them -- the liberal ones,"" he said. ""That's the reason why they criticize us. They are fighting for themselves, not against us. But we are an example that a country which is based on traditional values, on national identity, on the tradition of Christianity can be successful – sometimes more successful than a leftist-liberal government.""

Orban said Biden and the Democratic Party cannot accept the success Hungary has seen in protecting its Serbian and Croatian borders.

In the U.S. Congress, several top Democrats have also criticized Orban for alleged ""xenophobic language"" and unacceptable closeness to Russia. Now-former-Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the former chairman of the foreign affairs committee, joined House Hungarian Caucus co-chair Marcy Kaptur of Ohio to strongly advise Trump against hosting Orban as he did last year for those reasons.

Of Biden's initial comment about ""totalitarians"" which named Hungary, Orban's secretary of state for international communication Zoltan Kovacs notably remarked last year: ""So, this is what we can expect from the Democrats… more condescension and lecturing?"".

More broadly, Orban spoke at length about the importance of a Christian-Democratic ideology in government, saying that even a countervailing left-wing government in the U.S. will benefit from Hungary's political position.

""It's better for the leftist liberal government in the United States to have a good partner, which is a Christian-Democratic one supported long-term by the people, the Hungarian people.""

Orban further argued that there is nothing hateful or xenophobic about a strong national defense and secure borders:

""[National sovereignty] is coming from God, and nature. All begins with us. This is our country. This is our population. This is our history, our language. We have to [secure our borders]. Of course, if you're in trouble and there's nobody closer to you than the Hungarians, you have to be helpful,"" he said.

""But you can't say, okay, it's a nice country. I would like to come and live here because it's a nicer life, it is not a human right to come here. No way. It's our land. It's a nation, a community, family, history, tradition, language.""

Host Tucker Carlson noted the disparity between the immigration policies of Orban's Hungary compared to another powerful Central European government – Angela Merkel's Germany.

The host also added that the U.S. and other Western governments that have ostracized Orban and Hungary are doing the opposite of what they once did when he was a young activist bravely speaking out against Soviet occupation in the 1980s. Carlson inferred that Orban has not changed since, but that the prevailing worldview toward conservative governments like his has – in the host's words, starkly transitioned from universal support to being dubbed a ""totalitarian"" thug by the United States' leader.",https://www.foxnews.com
599,Mayorkas says White supremacists pose 'most prominent threat' to US homeland,Marisa Schultz,"

White supremacists pose the biggest terror threat to the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Friday amid a surge of illegal border crossings.

The Department of Homeland Security has assessed that ""the greatest terrorism-related threat that we face in the homeland is the threat of domestic violent extremism,"" Mayorkas said.

Citing an ""increase in hate"" that's spread on social media and other online platforms, Mayorkas further specified that ""the most prominent threat is the threat of White supremacists.""

Mayorkas made the remarks during a speech at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference in New York City. The secretary pointed to the ""repeated and persistent bomb threats"" against Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in recent months as an example of the threats and talked of his recent work with Black universities and churches to improve security.

Both Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland previously said White supremacist extremists represent the most persistent and lethal threat to the homeland when they testified before the Senate last May. Mentioning the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol, Mayorkas and Garland said their agencies would dedicate more resources to fight against domestic terrorism, create new intelligence initiatives and work with foreign partners and tech companies to help stem the growing threat, the Washington Post reported at the time.

Mayorkas' threat assessment comes at a time of historically high illegal border crossings.

There were more than 1.7 million migrant encounters in FY 2021, and FY 2022 is on pace to exceed that, with what is expected to be more than 1 million encounters in the first six months of the fiscal year alone.

Border agents will lose another tool in May when the Biden Administration ends the Title 42 public health order that has been used since March 2020 to quickly expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mayorkas reaffirmed Friday that Title 42 is going away, and migrants will be able to claim asylum.

""Our asylum laws provide that if one qualifies, one can access residency in the United States,"" Mayorkas said. ""And if one does not, one can be removed. In the time of the pandemic, we have been exercising Title 42.

""It is a public health imperative, not an immigration policy. … Title 42 will end on May 23 as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has expressed, and then we will be implementing our asylum process as it was designed.""

U.S. lawmakers are reportedly questioning California Sen. Dianne Feinstein's capacity to do her job at her age.

Senators and other officials are reportedly concerned that Diane Feinstein, 88, is no longer mentally competent enough to do her job as a lawmaker, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Feinstein's critics, however, have declined to speak on the record and asked to have their names withheld.

""I have worked with her for a long time and long enough to know what she was like just a few years ago: always in command, always in charge, on top of the details, basically couldn’t resist a conversation where she was driving some bill or some idea. All of that is gone,"" an anonymous lawmaker told the Chronicle.

DIANNE FEINSTEIN ON ABORTION: CALIFORNIA SENATOR SUGGESTS A 15-WEEK FETUS ISN'T A HUMAN BEING

""She was an intellectual and political force not that long ago, and that’s why my encounter with her was so jarring. Because there was just no trace of that,"" the lawmaker allegedly continued.

""It’s bad, and it’s getting worse,"" a Democratic senator reportedly told the Chronicle.

Sources speaking to the Chronicle about the issue remained anonymous.

In particular, Feinstein has defended any perceived distractions as a consequence of her husband's tragic death due to cancer earlier this year.

""The last year has been extremely painful and distracting for me, flying back and forth to visit my dying husband who passed just a few weeks ago,"" Feinstein's office told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""But there’s no question I’m still serving and delivering for the people of California, and I’ll put my record up against anyone’s.""

Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992. The 88-year-old Democrat has not indicated whether she plans to run for re-election.

The anonymous nature of the accusations and Feinstein's well-documented experience with tragedy over the past year leave her unnamed critics in a murky position.

Former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer of California suggested in December that Feinstein should consider retiring.

Boxer said that if she spoke to Feinstein she’d express to her that a life away from Washington can be fulfilling on its own, according to the Los Angeles Times.

""If Sen. Feinstein were to call me today and asked my advice, I would say only you can decide this,"" Boxer said in an article published on Thursday.

602,Purdue University campus police release footage of student arrest that sparked outrage,Audrey Conklin,"

Purdue University has released body camera footage showing a campus police officer arresting a student on Feb. 4 in an incident that sparked outrage across social media.

Student Adonis Tuggle posted an initial video of the incident taken by his girlfriend to Instagram in February showing Purdue University Campus Police (PUCP) Officer Jon Selke pinning Tuggle to the ground in a bank of snow while he and his girlfriend beg him to stop.

The university also released the 911 call that led to the arrest incident in which someone on campus reports ""a couple…screaming really loud,"" with a male standing outside a car parked near a university building and a female sitting inside the car.

The newly released footage from Selke's body camera shows the entire incident from the moment police arrive to the scene and the moment they leave. Tuggle can be heard telling the officer in the video that he has his girlfriend's phone and wallet because ""she's not listening"" to him, and he was ""trying to get her attention.""

PURDUE STUDENTS CONDEMN ‘POLICE BRUTALITY’ AFTER CAMPUS INCIDENT CAUGHT ON VIDEO

""Alright, here's the deal. Go behind the car. I asked you nicely once,"" Selke says in the bleeped video obtained by Fox News Digital through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

Things escalate quickly when the officer asks Tuggle to put his hands behind his back and says something to Tuggle's girlfriend that has been redacted. Tuggle then repeatedly tells the officer, ""Don't talk to her like that,"" followed by, ""Don't talk to me like that.""

Selke then pins Tuggle to the snowbank as the student and his girlfriend repeatedly tell the officer ""stop"" and ""get off"" of him. Both the student and his girlfriend appear to be in significant distress, and the girlfriend informs the officer that she is recording.

DEFUND NYPD GROUP SAYS POLICE ‘FAILED’ AFTER SUBWAY ATTACK, OFFER ‘HOLISTIC’ ALTERNATIVE

""I can't do anything,"" the girlfriend can be heard saying. ""You're hurting him!""

Selke tells Tuggle to ""stop resisting"" after additional officers eventually arrive at the scene. Tuggle is on the ground for several minutes while police handcuff him before he is helped up off the ground.

The footage was released after a special prosecutor in the case decided not to pursue charges in the case. Purdue University President Mitch Daniels, as well as Tuggle, the Purdue Board of Trustees, the Purdue University Police Department, and Selke jointly reached an agreement to take steps to ensure a similar incident does not take place on campus again, according to a press release.

""First, we understand and respect the prosecutor’s decision and are glad for his forbearance in not proceeding with charges against Adonis. Notwithstanding the legal considerations, we believe this was an incident that escalated too quickly in the distinctive context of our campus environment,"" Purdue President Mitch Daniels said in a statement. ""We recognize this is an outcome that no member of the Purdue community should expect in light of our high aspirations for community policing at Purdue, which have the primary aim of ensuring a safe and positive experience for our students on campus. ""

The university president continued: ""We deeply regret what happened, and we’re grateful for our community’s patience as we, alongside Adonis, Officer Jon Selke and their families, have worked to gain a better understanding of what occurred that night and a reconciliation among the parties to the incident.""

Selke and Tuggle also issued personal statements following the prosecutor's decision.

""I apologize for the impact of my actions on the night of February 4, 2022,"" Selke said. ""I have privately spoken with Adonis and his mother, Ms. Cornelia Dawson, to express my sincere apologies to them. I fully acknowledge how my actions and the images of this event have called into question the safety and belonging of Purdue’s Black community. I am very sorry for that.""

Tuggle said he is ""grateful"" for the leadership at Purdue and the ""support"" he has received in the weeks since the incident.

""I recently had the opportunity to meet Officer Selke and learn more about his background and his family, and to understand his own personal history and service in the military and as a PUPD officer,"" he said.

603,DeSantis vows to take on communist China: 'Not a vehicle that we want to be entangled with',Houston Keene,"

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis vowed to take on communist China, saying the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not something that his state wants to be involved with.

The Sunshine State Republican issued a press release on Monday regarding the meeting he held with the Florida State Board of Administration (SBA) members putting ""woke corporations"" and state investments in Chinese companies under the microscope.

""If you look at how these major companies behave when faced with Chinese disapproval, they censor what the CCP tells them to censor, and we see groveling apologies,"" DeSantis said in the release.

TOM COTTON URGES THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY

""Go back a generation, and the idea of the American elites was, ‘If we allow China into the WTO and give them most favored nation status, that will make China more like us,’"" the governor continued . ""This experiment has failed, and it has endangered our nation’s national and economic security.""

DeSantis also said he wanted the SBA to ""survey the investments that are currently being done"" and that when the state legislature returns, ""they can make statutory changes to say that the Communist Party of China is not a vehicle that we want to be entangled with.""

""I think that that would be something that would be very, very prudent,"" the governor said. ""I also think that our country as a whole, but certainly Florida would like to see more production and manufacturing re-shored, and we would be a great place to do that.""

""By retaking control of the state pension fund’s proxy voting from outside fund managers who may pursue social ideologies inconsistent with the state’s values or the financial interests of the state’s investments, and by determining the state’s exposure to Chinese investments, the actions taken today will further strengthen Florida’s fiscal footing and signal to those in corporate America who prop up a genocidal, authoritarian, imperialist regime that they will not do so with Floridians’ money,"" the release continues.

China has become the global elephant in the room as they host the 2022 Winter Olympics amid human rights abuses and the CCP’s genocide of Uyghur Muslims. While the Biden administration called for a ""diplomatic boycott"" of the Olympics, many Republican lawmakers and potential 2024 Republican presidential candidates said the Biden administration didn't go far enough and that the Olympics should be boycotted ""completely.""

""President Biden had the chance to actually stand up to Beijing’s genocide and human rights abuses, but again, he has chosen appeasement and weakness over strength and resolve,"" Sen.

604,"UK announces deal to send illegal migrants to Rwanda, says it is made possible by Brexit",Adam Shaw,"

The British government on Thursday announced that it will send migrants who illegally enter through its borders to Rwanda -- in a bid to stop illegal immigration that immediately drew criticism from left-wing politicians and activist groups.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the deal with the East African country, saying that it would allow anyone entering illegally, as well as any illegal immigrant who arrived since Jan 1., to be transported to Rwanda.

BREXIT PASSES FIRST MAJOR TEST IN UKRAINE WAR, OBSERVERS SAY

Johnson said in a speech that the move was made possible by Britain’s departure from the European Union, which gave Britain greater control over its immigration policies.

""This innovative approach driven by our shared humanitarian impulse and made possible by Brexit freedoms, will provide safe and legal routes for asylum while disrupting the business model of the gangs, because it means that economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system will not get to stay in the U.K.,"" Johnson said. ""While those in genuine need will be properly protected, including with access to legal services, on arrival in Rwanda and given the opportunity to build a new life in that dynamic country supported by the funding we are providing.""

Successive Britain governments have struggled with illegal immigration across the English Channel from France. Migrants will sneak onto the back of trucks or other vehicles coming across the channel between Calais and Dover -- or on small boats across the channel itself, often organized by criminal gangs.

Johnson said that seven out of 10 migrants who arrived on small boats were men under 40. Johnson said that attempted crossers have passed thorough ""manifestly safe countries, including many in Europe where they could and should have claimed asylum.""

More than 28,000 entered the U.K. on boats in 2021, up from 8,500 in 2020. It has led to concerns about exploitation by gangs, similar to the way cartels have exploited the crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the danger to migrants.

ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR MORE SANCTIONS AS UK'S BORIS JOHNSON MAKES SURPRISE KYIV VISIT

Johnson, in his speech, focused on the costs of illegal immigration to the British taxpayer, claiming the U.K. is generous to immigrants but that ""we cannot sustain a parallel illegal system.""

""Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity is not,"" Johnson said, saying it was unfair to ask British taxpayers to write a ""blank check"" for anyone who wishes to live in the U.K.

The policy was immediately criticized by human rights groups, who denied Johnson’s assertion that Rwanda is a safe country. It drew criticism from the left-wing Labour Party, with leader Keir Starmer calling the plan ""unworkable"" and ""extortionate"" and accused Johnson of seeking to distract from the controversy over his attendance at parties during COVID-19 lockdowns.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it had made its objections known to both countries.

""UNHCR remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,"" UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Gillian Triggs said in a statement.

The Rwandan government said the five-year agreement would see Britain paying approximately $157 million for housing and other migrant services.

But Moscow is taking issue with the sophisticated systems that the U.S. and NATO nations are arming Ukraine with and in a diplomatic démarche this week accused the U.S. of ""adding fuel"" to its war, first reported the Washington Post Friday.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters this week that the U.S. has been getting defensive aid to Ukraine at ""unprecedented speeds"" and noted that it takes just one week from the time Biden signs off on an aid package to when it gets into Ukrainian hands.

An entire delivery of an arms package takes roughly four weeks.

""I would remind [you] that we front load. Every shipment has a mix of material on board,"" the official said, noting that the last shipment contained surface-to-air defenses like Javelin and Stinger missiles, along with Switchblade drones armed with tank-busting warheads.

Pope Francis compared journalists' speculation that he quietly supported Russian President Vladimir Putin to sexual fetishism for excrement.

The pontiff decried the press reports and speculation about himself and the Vatican on April 7. The pope wrote a letter to Argentinian journalist Gustavo Sylvestre concerning reporters' theories that not explicitly naming Putin was a refusal to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The pope went on to accuse journalists of participating in common journalistic ""sins"" of ""disinformation, slander, defamation and coprophilia.""

POPE FRANCIS : 'A WORLDLY PRIEST' IS JUST 'A CLERICALIZED PAGAN'

""Coprophilia"" is the scientific name for a sexual fascination with human feces.

""Sad! Such a noble vocation as that of communications being soiled,"" Pope Francis wrote in his April 7 letter.

This is not the first time that Pope Francis has made the vulgar comparison. In 2016, he said something similar about journalists seeking to find scandal anywhere they can.

""I believe that the media should be very clear, very transparent, and not fall prey – without offense, please – to the sickness of coprophilia, which is always wanting to communicate scandal, to communicate ugly things, even though they may be true,"" the pontiff told Belgian weekly Catholic newspaper Tertio.

In a Wednesday message, the pontiff said the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was like biblical siblings Cain and Abel.

The pope sent the message to an interreligious pilgrimage group organized by the Elijah Interfaith Institute, according to Vatican's news office.

The USS The Sullivans, a decommissioned Navy warship, has partially sunk in waters near Buffalo, New York.

The Navy destroyer, commissioned in 1943, began listing to its starboard side Thursday. Workers in the Naval and Military Park where it is held have begun efforts to save the ship with support from local and state politicians.

""The USS Sullivans is a National Historic Landmark and a true Western New York treasure.

611,"Durham says CIA found data alleging Trump-Russia connection not 'technically plausible,' was 'user created'",Brooke Singman,"

Special Counsel John Durham asserted in a court filing Friday that the CIA concluded data from Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann alleging coordination between Donald Trump and Russia was ""not technically plausible"" and was ""user created.""

In the filing, Durham responded to objections from Sussmann’s defense regarding what evidence could be admissible at Sussmann's trial, which is scheduled to begin next month. Sussmann is accused of lying to the FBI by saying he was not attending a meeting on behalf of a particular client when he was actually presenting the information on behalf of the HIllary Clinton campaign and a technology executive with whom he worked.

DURHAM RELEASES FORMER CLINTON LAWYER MICHAEL SUSSMANN'S TEXT MESSAGE, SAYS HE PUT 'LIE IN WRITING'

Durham in February first revealed that the government would establish during trial that among the data ""exploited"" was domain name system (DNS) internet traffic pertaining to ""a particular healthcare provider, Trump Tower, Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building, and the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP).""

In February, Durham said data was exploited ""by mining the EOP's DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,"" adding the data was used to establish ""an inference"" and ""narrative"" tying Trump to Russia.

But Sussmann is moving to preclude evidence concerning the ""gathering"" of that ""DNS data"" by ""Tech Executive 1,"" who has been identified as Rodney Joffe, and his associates.

In Friday's filing, Durham argued that the gathering of the data is a ""necessary factual backdrop to the charged conduct.""

Durham's original indictment alleges Sussmann told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016 — less than two months before the 2016 presidential election — he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting where he presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

The indictment alleges that Sussmann lied in the meeting, ""falsely stating to the general counsel that he was not providing the allegations to the FBI on behalf of any client.""

Sussmann has pleaded not guilty and has sought to dismiss the case. The federal judge presiding over the case denied that request this week.

DURHAM PROBE: JUDGE DENIES SUSSMANN MOTION TO DISMISS CASE; TRIAL TO BEGIN NEXT MONTH

Durham also alleges that Sussmann in February 2017 provided an ""updated set of allegations,"" including the Alfa Bank claims, and additional allegations related to Trump to a second U.S. government agency, which Fox News has confirmed was the CIA.

In his filing Friday, Durham says the government expects to ""adduce evidence at trial"" that will reflect that the FBI and the CIA ""concluded that the Russian Bank 1 allegations were untrue and unsupported.

""For example, while the FBI did not reach an ultimate conclusion regarding the data’s accuracy or whether it might have been in whole or in part genuine, spoofed, altered, or fabricated, Agency 2 concluded in early 2017 that the Russian Bank 1 data and Russian Phone Provider 1 data was not ‘technically plausible,’ did not ‘withstand technical scrutiny,’ ‘contained gaps,’ ‘conflicted with [itself],’ and was ‘user created and not machine/tool generated,"" Durham wrote.

However, Durham states that ""the Special Counsel’s Office has not reached a definitive conclusion in this regard.""

But Durham argued that ""separate and apart from whether the data was actually unreliable or provided a motive"" for Sussmann to lie, evidence concerning the steps the FBI and CIA took to ""investigate these matters is critical to establishing materiality.""

Durham said that information will ""enable the jury to evaluate those steps, which, in turn, will inform their conclusions about whether the defendant’s alleged false statement was material and could tend to influence or impair government functions.""

Meanwhile, Durham outlines the connection between Sussmann and the now-infamous and discredited anti-Trump dossier, which contained allegations of purported coordination between Trump and the Russian government.

The unverified dossier was authored by ex-British Intelligence agent Christopher Steele and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The law firm Perkins Coie is the firm that the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign funded the anti-Trump dossier through.

In Durham’s filing Friday, he revealed that Sussmann met in the summer of 2016 with Steele at the Perkins Coie offices, where he told Steele about the Alfa Bank allegations.

HILLARY CLINTON 2016 TWEETS PUSHED NOW-DEBUNKED CLAIM OF TRUMP USE OF 'COVERT SERVER' LINKED TO RUSSIA

Durham states that after their meeting, personnel from the ""U.S. Investigative Firm,"" which Fox News previously reported is Fusion GPS, tasked Steele to ""research and produce intelligence reports"" about Alfa Bank, ""which he did.""

Durham, in his filing, states that Sussmann ""represented and worked for the Clinton campaign in connection with its broader opposition research efforts"" and ""took steps to integrate"" the Alfa Bank allegations ""into those opposition research efforts.""

Durham argued that the evidence is ""highly probative"" because it establishes that Sussmann ""represented and worked for the Clinton campaign with its broader opposition research efforts.""

Durham also states the evidence establishes that Sussmann ""carried out his September 19, 2016, meeting with the FBI in order to, among other things, further the interests of the Clinton campaign with assistance from"" Fusion GPS.

In the filing, Durham also points to notes from a former FBI assistant director that state, among other things, that ""the dossier’s author was hired"" by Fusion GPS to ""dig up dirt on Trump for an unnamed U.S. client.""

""The fact that FBI headquarters received on the same date both sets of information involving the same political campaign (Clinton campaign), the same law firm [Perkins Coie] and the same investigative firm [Fusion GPS] makes Steele’s involvement in these matters relevant,"" Durham wrote.

Meanwhile, Sussmann’s defense has made a motion to give immunity to Tech Executive 1, Rodney Joffe, who has not been charged with a crime.

In Durham’s filing, however, he reveals that Joffe is ""a subject"" of the investigation and has been since prior to Sussmann’s indictment in 2021. Durham says this has been communicated with Joffe’s counsel, and that he still remains a subject, even one month short of trial.

Durham said that the decision not to grant Joffe immunity was ""entirely reasonable and consistent with the Department of Justice’s practices,"" given that he ""played a critical leadership role in assembling and submitting the allegations at issue, and therefore would likely carry greater criminal exposure and potential culpability in the event the government’s investigation were to reveal or confirm the commission of crimes other than the offense currently charged.""

DURHAM SAYS 'NO BASIS' TO STRIKE 'FACTUAL BACKGROUND' FROM FILING, DENIES INTENT TO 'POLITICIZE' SUSSMANN CASE

Durham, though, revealed that the only witness for Sussmann’s trial ""immunized by the government"" was ""Researcher 2,"" whose identity is unknown. That individual’s immunity began in July 2021, over a month before Sussmann’s indictment.

Durham said the government immunized ""Researcher 2"" because ""at least five other witnesses who conducted work relating to the Russian Bank 1 allegations invoked their right against self-incrimination.""

""The government therefore pursued Researcher 2’s immunity in order to uncover otherwise unavailable facts underlying the opposition research project that Tech Executive 1 and others carried out in advance of the defendant’s meeting with the FBI,"" Durham states.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

In the filing, though, Durham also reveals that the government ""intends to seek immunity at trial for an individual who was employed at the U.S. investigative firm,"" Fusion GPS.

""But unlike Tech Executive 1, that individual is considered a ‘witness’ and not a ‘subject’ of the government’s investigation based on currently known facts,"" Durham states.

Meanwhile, Durham says the government, during trial, plans to offer redacted, non-privileged documents containing communications between Sussmann and Joffe and redacted billing records reflecting Sussmann’s work ""on behalf of the Clinton campaign"" and Joffe.

Durham says prosecutors also plan to offer communications between Sussmann, Joffe and ""Campaign Lawyer 1,"" who sources tell Fox News is Perkins Coie partner and Clinton lawyer Marc Elias, as well as employees of Fusion GPS.

Sussmann’s trial is scheduled to begin May 16.

Durham, since 2019, has been investigating the origins of the FBI’s original Russia probe, or Crossfire Hurricane, which began in July 2016 through the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017. That was shortly after Mueller completed his years-long investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded or coordinated with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election.

Mueller's investigation found no evidence of illegal or criminal coordination between Trump or the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016.

Durham has indicted three people as part of his investigation: Sussmann in September 2021, Igor Danchenko in November 2021 and Kevin Clinesmith in August 2020.

Danchenko was charged with making a false statement and is accused of lying to the FBI about the source of information he provided to Christopher Steele for the anti-Trump dossier.

Kevin Clinesmith was also charged with making a false statement. Clinesmith had been referred for potential prosecution by the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which conducted its own review of the Russia investigation.

Specifically, the inspector general accused Clinesmith, though not by name, of altering an email about Trump campaign aide Carter Page to say that he was ""not a source"" for another government agency. Page has said he was a source for the CIA. The DOJ relied on that assertion as it submitted a third and final renewal application in 2017 to eavesdrop on Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

612,Fourth Texas migrant bus arrives in DC near US Capitol,Caitlin Mcfall,"

A fourth bus transporting migrants from Texas who crossed the U.S. border illegally arrived in the nation's capital Saturday.

The bus, transporting approximately 10 passengers, arrived near Union Station in Washington D.C. Saturday morning. Passengers were dropped off at the same area as previous envoys – blocks away from the Capitol and directly in front of the city's central train station.

THIRD TEXAS MIGRANT BUS ARRIVES NEAR US CAPITOL

The Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), a social services organization, arrived to support the migrants as they disembarked.

CARECEN provided the migrant group with food and water, then took them to Union Station to eat and use the bathroom.

The busloads of migrants have been a continued campaign by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has told journalists that the White House has failed to take the problem of illegal immigration into Southern states seriously.

Texas began sending an unspecified number of buses en route to Washington, D.C., on April 8, following Abbott's statement that Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) officials would be transporting migrants released in Texas communities to the nation's capital.

The White House initially described it as a ""publicity stunt,"" with many assuming the governor would not follow through. The Friday bus carried approximately 30 migrants.

Abbott has been highly critical of the Biden administration's handling of the border crisis, stating that the federal government has failed in properly assessing the border situation.

During remarks at a ceremony for a Texas Department of Safety Memorial, Abbott stated more than 1.6 million people had crossed the border into Texas illegally in the last 15 months.

The legality of Abbott's move to send migrant buses to Washington, D.C., remains in question, however. The 2012 Supreme Court case, Arizona v. the United States, established states could not make their own immigration policies.

Abbott's transportation of unlawful migrants to another area of the country is not unique. The federal government has transported thousands of migrants across the country to different states via bus and plane, often without warning or public acknowledgement.

The Biden administration recently resumed sending charter flights of migrants to an airport in suburban New York .

The effort, first highlighted in October by the New York Post, is reported to have resumed as illegal immigrants continue to pour into the country, according to a report from the Post Friday.

Members of the Post's staff ""watched as a group of migrant teens got off an Avelo Airlines plane"" at the airport around 9:25 p.m. Thursday and ""boarded three waiting buses that drove off about 50 minutes later,"" the report stated.

613,NC medical school backs student who suggested she harmed patient for mocking pronoun pin,Anders Hagstrom,"

Wake Forest University Medical School is standing by a student who suggested she intentionally harmed one of her patients for disagreeing with her about transgender ideology.

The student, fourth-year Kychelle Del Rosario, came under fire after appearing to boast about the incident on Twitter in late March. The university responded with a brief suspension but announced no further consequences in its latest statement.

Del Rosario tweeted: ""I had a patient I was doing a blood draw on see my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff ‘She/Her? Well of course it is! What other pronouns even are there?’ I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice.""

The university publicly responded to the incident in a statement on Wednesday, saying Del Rosario's tweet was not an accurate recounting of the incident.

""Our documentation verifies that after the student physician was unsuccessful in obtaining the blood draw, the student appropriately deferred a second attempt to one of our certified professionals. The student did not attempt to draw blood again,"" the school wrote.

ETHICS PROFESSOR SLAMS MEDICAL STUDENT WHO IMPLIED SHE STUCK A PATIENT FOR MOCKING HER PRONOUN PIN

The university's statement included a lengthy apology letter from Del Rosario, in which she claims she never intended to harm the individual, blaming the missed vein on inexperience.

""For the event mentioned in the tweet, I was performing a blood draw on a patient and during our conversation they had shown dismay at my pronoun pin,"" Del Rosario wrote, according to the university newspaper. ""I calmly shared my thoughts about pronouns and did not escalate the situation further. When I was doing the blood draw, I missed the first time due to my inexperience as a student, and per our policy, my supervisor performed the successful blood draw the second time. During this encounter, I never intended to harm the patient.""

""I am truly sorry for poorly representing our school and our health system. I will reflect on responsible social media use as a professional and my duty to care for all my patients, regardless of any differences of belief,"" she concluded.

While Del Rosario's actions led to heavy criticism on social media, many of her fellow Wake Forest students jumped to defend her. One op-ed published in the school's newspaper was titled ""Criticism of Wake Forest medical student is excessive.""

""The crux of the issue at hand is not the conduct of Del Rosario, but the bigotry expressed by her patient,"" claimed the author, opinions editor and sophomore Sophie Guymon. ""It is appalling that the vast majority of the media coverage surrounding Del Rosario’s tweet is critiquing her lack of professionalism rather than her patient’s display of bigotry.""",https://www.foxnews.com

616,"Most homicide victims in many US cities are Black, key data shows",Matt Finn,"

LOS ANGELES – At least 16 U.S. cities witnessed record-high homicide rates in 2021, while New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, saw notable homicide spikes. Who were the victims in these American cities?

New data provided by Freedom of Information Act requests and analyzed by Fox News shows Black males were overwhelmingly the No. 1 demographic killed in most cities.

In Chicago, which tallied the most homicides since 1996, 648 of the city’s 797 homicide victims were Black.

In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 105 of the city’s 133 homicides were Black males. In Columbus, Ohio, 135 of the city’s 204 homicides were of Black males. In Louisville, Kentucky, 133 of the city’s 197 homicide victims were Black males. In St. Paul, Minnesota, 17 of the city’s 38 homicides were of Black males.

In Los Angeles, 397 people were killed in 2021 — the most in a year since 2007. Hispanic males were the top demographic killed in L.A. last year, 183 in total, in a city that has a much larger Hispanic than Black population.

Cortlyn Bridges of Monrovia, California, sat down with Fox News to talk about the loss of her 28-year-old daughter, Ky Thomas, who was shot and killed in December 2020 after a sunset scooter ride on the Venice Beach boardwalk.

""It’s an undescribable pain. It’s a piercing pain that I don’t think any mother should have to experience,"" Bridges told Fox News.

Bridges said Ky had an 8-year-old daughter and had just given birth to a son weeks before her murder. Ky and her husband were returning rented scooters to the rental shop when something went awry, and Ky was shot.

""My daughter was not a gang member,"" Bridges said, ""under no circumstances.""

Bridges said her entire family, the alleged killer’s families and the community all have been bearing the pain of Ky’s murder.

""We all lose out. Nobody wins. My daughter, she’s never coming back,"" Bridges said. ""Their parents, their families, the only difference is, they can still get phone calls. They can get visits. They can get letters. My daughter, she can never call me.""

CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ROBBED OF IPHONES ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL

Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón’s office recently announced the arrest of two suspects in Ky Thomas' death. Isiah Eugene Caldwell Jr., 28, and Jonathan Michael Singh, 30. Both faced one count each of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Gascón now has been asking the public for help arresting additional suspects involved and wrote in a statement, ""My deepest condolences go out to the friends and family of Ky Thomas and my heart breaks for her small children and her mother who has fought so diligently for justice.""

There is progress in Bridges’ case – but Gascón and many other district attorneys have been under fire for what critics have called ""soft on crime"" policies contributing to the nation’s spike in homicides.

Fox News spoke to Eric Siddall, a prosecutor in Gascón’s office and vice president of the Association for Deputy District Attorneys in Los Angeles. Siddall is a registered Democrat and calls himself a socially ""liberal,"" but he said he blames Gascón’s policies for L.A.’s homicide and crime spike.

""One of the big drivers of crime in Los Angeles are guns and gangs and right now, this district attorney has basically said we cannot prosecute people for gang crimes and is not interested in prosecuting people for gun crimes, and that has really led to this surge in homicides,"" Siddall said.

CHICAGO MAYOR SPEAKS ON CARJACKING ‘CRISIS’

He added that similar policies nationwide have affected people of color – primarily Black men.

""Right now, the system, especially certain types of district attorneys, are siding with the criminal over the victim,"" Siddall said.

Fox News reached out to Gascón’s office for comment about this case but did not hear back. At a news conference touting his accomplishments this past December, Gascón explained his philosophy of prosecuting L.A.’s crime, saying a ""punishment-based"" approach did not serve L.A. well.

""I have begun to transform the criminal legal system in ways that holds people accountable while serving the residents of Los Angeles County with fairness and humanity,"" Gascón said.

Bridges said she forgave her daughter's killers, but was concerned any additional suspects in the case could be tried as juveniles and face a minimum sentence for her daughter’s murder.

Florida's Department of Education (DOE) rejected 41% of mathematics textbooks submitted for use in the state's public schools Friday, citing critical race theory and other issues with the texts.

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has led a push to reform education standards and practices in the state. Florida called for textbook submissions from publishers in 2021 in accordance with a 2019 executive order from DeSantis aimed at eliminating Common Core standards in the state. The textbooks rejected ""were impermissible with either Florida’s new standards or contained prohibited topics.""

The 41% rejection rate was the highest in Florida's history.

""It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,"" DeSantis said in a statement accompanying the announcement. ""I’m grateful that Commissioner Corcoran and his team at the Department have conducted such a thorough vetting of these textbooks to ensure they comply with the law.""

619,"For Passover and Good Friday, NYT essayist writes about ‘killing’ ‘hateful God’",Gabriel Hays,"

The New York Times decided to publish a guest essay heavily criticizing God on Good Friday and the start of Passover.

Shalom Auslander composed a piece insisting that this Passover, we should stop paying attention to God:

""In this time of war and violence, of oppression and suffering, I propose we pass over something else: God,"" he began, before claiming God is ""hateful,"" full of ""brutality,"" and, if mortal, ""would be dragged to the Hague.""

Auslander criticized God whose ""wrath"" and ""plagues"" harnessed against the Egyptians during the original Passover story from the Book of Exodus, remind him of what the Russians are doing to the Ukrainians right now.

FOR PASSOVER, DENNIS PRAGER REVEALS THE REAL REASON THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE SURVIVED 3,500 YEARS

According to the author, Israel’s ancient enemies were troubling, ""But just as troubling — even more so today in light of the brutal slaughter taking place in Ukraine — were the plagues themselves.""

""Egyptians young and old, innocent and guilty, suffered locusts and frogs, hail and darkness, beasts running wild and water becoming blood,"" Auslander lamented.

""Surely, I wondered, there were some Egyptians who didn’t whip Jews, who didn’t have anything against Jews at all?"" he asked.

The author opined, ""God, it seems, paints with a wide brush. He paints with a roller. In Egypt, said our rabbi, he even killed first-born cattle. He killed cows.""

WHY PASSOVER SYMBOLIZES THE 'MESSAGE OF AMERICA' AND 'YOU ARE NOT A VICTIM'

He then made the point, ""If he were mortal, the God of Jews, Christians and Muslims would be dragged to The Hague. And yet we praise him. We emulate him. We implore our children to be like him.""

""Perhaps now, as missiles rain down and the dead are discovered in mass graves, is a good time to stop emulating this hateful God,"" the guest essayist proposed.

Auslander then traveled back through Biblical history with other examples proving how God is so ""hateful.""

He also mentioned the plight of Eve. ""Cursing all women for eternity because of Eve’s choices?"" he asked incredulously.

The author recounted how at the end of his family’s traditional Seder meal each year, ""we open the front door and call out to Him, ‘Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that did not know you!’"" and then slammed God for obliging: ""And God does. With plagues and floods, with fire and fury, on the young and old, the guilty and innocent.""

Auslander explained how humanity emulates God in the worst way. ""And we humans, made in his image, do the same. With fixed-wing bombers and cluster bombs, with self-propelled mortars and thermobaric rocket launchers.""

A South Carolina judge set a $25,000 bond for a suspect in a mall shooting on Saturday that left 14 people injured, according to the Columbia Police Department.

Jewayne Price, 22, will be on house arrest but allowed to travel to and from work while wearing an ankle monitor if he posts bond.

He was charged with unlawful carrying of a pistol and could face additional charges after the prosecutor reviews evidence.

Price is one of three people who were detained by law enforcement following the shooting. The other two adults males were released after police determined they weren't involved.

""We don’t believe this was random,"" Columbia Police Chief W.H. ""Skip"" Holbrook said at a news conference. ""We believe they knew each other and something led to the gunfire.""

SOUTH CAROLINA MALL SHOOTING LEAVES MORE THAN A DOZEN INJURED

Evidence collected at the scene indicates at least three people displayed guns and two firearms were used, according to police.

Price was previously arrested in June 2018 and charged with accessory before the fact following the shooting death of 17-year-old Amon Rice in Hopkins, South Carolina. The outcome of that is unclear.

""We catch people, they serve a little bit of time, they get out and they get right back doing what they normally do and that’s commit crimes,"" Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said at a recent press conference. ""The criminal justice system needs to do better.""

CALIFORNIA 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL WOUNDED IN MALL SHOOTING

Price's attorney, South Carolina state Rep. Todd Rutherford, claims that his client acted in self-defense.

""It was unprovoked by him. He called the police, turned himself in, turned over the firearm that was used in this, and gave a statement to the Columbia Police Department,"" Rutherford said after the bond hearing, according to WIS. ""That is why he got a $25,000 bond.""

The 14 victims range in age from 15 to 73. At least nine of them suffered gunshot wounds, while the other five were injured while trying to flee the chaos.

The 73-year-old victim is still being treated at a local hospital, while the other 13 victims have been released.

621,Former stripper running for Congress says 'climate emergency' partially prompted decision to get an abortion,Thomas Phippen,"

A Pennsylvania candidate for the U.S. House has been open about her past as a part-time stripper in college and her decision to get an abortion when she was 18.

Alexandra Hunt, who is running for the Democratic nomination for a Philadelphia-area congressional district, has used her past to drive attention to her progressive campaign platform, including by starting an OnlyFans page for herself that is not associated with her campaign.

In a May 2021 video posted to Twitter, Hunt described what led her to get an abortion a decade ago.

""When I was 18, I was part of the 2% of people who can get pregnant on birth control and I found out I was pregnant. And I decided that I was not ready to bring a child in this world and I decided to get an abortion,"" Hunt says in the video.

PRO-LIFE CAUCUS CHAIR CHRIS SMITH OUTLINES CONSERVATIVE EFFORTS AS DEMS GO FOR 'JUGULAR' ON ABORTION

Hunt went on to say that the state of the world back then, and today, was not the kind of place she would want to bring a child into anyway. ""I as a person was not ready to bring a child into this world, but also the world was not in a state — and is not, 10 years later, is not in a state — that I wanted to bring a child into yet, which is my decision to make,"" she said.

She also lists the reasons she thought the world was not in a state for her to raise a child. ""My generation faces a lack of jobs, a lack of living wage, a housing crisis, an affordable housing crisis, a student debt crisis, the climate emergency, the prison-industrial complex, and the list goes on and on. And I wanted to offer my child better.""

Hunt said she got her abortion through Planned Parenthood, and that the decision ""was made with a lot of love.""

In a December tweet, Hunt said: ""Having an abortion enabled me to progress in my career, cut ties in an abusive relationship, and get to a place of economic security so I can properly care for my future children when I’m ready to become a mother.

Hunt told Fox News Digital in a statement that she believes her decision to be open about her previous career is resonating with voters.

SENATE VOTES TO BLOCK DEMOCRAT BILL ENSHRINING ABORTION AS SUPREME COURT RECONSIDERS ROE V WADE

""We just out-raised the incumbent in the first quarter of 2022, so I think my decision to not be ashamed of how I afforded to go to college is resonating with voters. People are sick of being shamed for perfectly legitimate choices they've made in their lives,"" Hunt said.

Hunt is running to unseat incumbent Democratic Rep. Dwight Evans in the primary election May 17. She reported raising nearly $328,000 in the first quarter of 2022 — which is more than Evans' total haul of nearly $260,000 in the same period. However, Evans' campaign has over $769,000 total cash on hand compared to Hunt's $535,000.

""As far as my abortion, I was 18 and was not able or ready to be a mother,"" Hunt told Fox Digital. ""Other women who make a different choice should be respected for their choice, as long as it is actually a choice, not coerced by government.""

""I plan on having children and am very much looking forward to being a mother and raising my children in safe, sustainable, just world that our movement is fighting for,"" Hunt added.

After taking criticism for her previous abortion and work as a stripper, Hunt started an OnlyFans account this week — which drew more attention to her candidacy. There, she has continued to promote a progressive platform and state that she is not beholden to corporations.

""Contrary to many of our elected officials, I'm now making honest money on #OnlyFans instead of investing in the fossil fuel industry that's leading to the destruction of our planet,"" Hunt said in a post on her OnlyFans page.

Hunt also supports her campaign through an online store selling shirts that say ""Elect Hoes"" and ""I may have danced for money but I'm no corporate whore.""

The decision to be open about her previous career pole dancing was two-fold, Hunt said in an interview earlier this year. ""I was nervous that that somebody could just come out of the woodwork and be like 'that actually looks like a stripper I used to know' and pull apart our campaign,"" Hunt told podcaster Nick Viall in February.

She said she also opened up about being a stripper in order to represent sex workers.

""I think that to fall silent on a community that is so marginalized is harmful, so I chose to fight back against the stigma and the shame that is associated with this part of my past, and lead with it so that I can advocate for a community that I'm a part of,"" she said.",https://www.foxnews.com

Former ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart’s woke new series ""The Problem with Jon Stewart"" has been dubbed a flop, according to new reports.

Stewart’s Apple TV+ show, which debuted in September, averaged only about 180,000 U.S. homes within the first week. By the fifth episode in March, viewership went down 78% to only 40,000 U.S. homes within seven days, according to Bloomberg.

By comparison, Samba TV reported approximately 844,000 U.S. homes tuned in to a March episode of HBO Max’s ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver"" hosted by fellow comedian John Oliver.

Stewart’s latest show was previously panned by many news outlets after its initial release. The series has also been blasted by online viewers for offering ""super-woke"" and ""anti-White"" takes.

In two episodes that aired in March, Stewart insinuated that British-American author Andrew Sullivan was racist by agreeing with a guest accusing Sullivan of perpetuating ""racist, dog-whistle tropes."" A separate episode featured Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., calling out Stewart for suggesting ""White resentment"" led to White people opposing financial aid to Black farmers.

""No, no … When you say White farmers, if I'm a White farmer listening to this in Iowa I'm thinking to myself, 'Jon Stewart's calling me – Jon Stewart's blaming me for stopping Booker's legislation.' That's not true,"" Booker said.

Apple TV+ has declined to release its viewership numbers, but reports from Parrot Analytics have shown that Stewart’s program is the eighth most in-demand talk show in the U.S., ahead of programs hosted by Ellen DeGeneres and James Corden and behind ones hosted by the likes of Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah.

Entertainment Weekly magazine also reported that the show is the number one unscripted series on Apple TV+.

623,Kentucky lawmakers override governor's veto of bill banning transgender athletes from girls' sports,Kyle Morris,"

The Republican-controlled legislature in Kentucky voted Wednesday to override Democrat Gov. Andy Beshear's veto of legislation that would prohibit transgender athletes from competing in sex-segregated sporting events from sixth grade through college.

The expected move came after Beshear refused to sign Senate Bill 83 last week and claimed it was most likely unconstitutional. He said the legislation ""discriminates against transgender people"" and therefore would not hold up in court.

The measure is now law in the state after the Republicans overrode the veto of the legislation, which originally passed through the state House with a 70 to 23 vote and the state Senate with a 26 to 9 vote.

PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE PASSES BILL PREVENTING TRANSGENDER FEMALES FROM COMPETING IN FEMALE SPORTS

Under the new law, a student’s gender will be determined by the ""biological sex"" indicated on the student’s certified birth certificate ""as originally issued at the time of birth or adoption."" This means individuals who transitioned to female later in life could not participate on sports teams designated female in the state.

Republican Sen. Robby Mills, the bill’s lead sponsor, has said the measure would ensure girls and women compete against other ""biological females.""

Mills has said the bill reflects concerns from parents across the Bluegrass State. He said it ""thinks ahead"" to prevent situations where girls or women are unfairly competing against biological males.

""It would be crushing for a young lady to train her whole career to have it end up competing against a biological male in the state tournament or state finals,"" Mills said during a previous debate on the bill.

In vetoing the measure, Beshear said its backers had failed to present a ""single instance"" in Kentucky of someone gaining a competitive advantage as a result of a ""sex reassignment.""

""Transgender children deserve public officials’ efforts to demonstrate that they are valued members of our communities through compassion, kindness and empathy, even if not understanding,"" the governor wrote.

The measure also faced criticism from others in the state.

""This bill is a solution in search of a non-existent problem,"" said Samuel Crankshaw, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. ""It is rooted in hate and unconstitutional.""

624,"What is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and why is it under fire?",Brian Flood,"

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 is under a harsh new spotlight in the wake of Google's move to force conservative news site The Federalist to remove its comments section or risk being demonetized, and a new bill would stop tech giants from taking advantage of the controversial piece of legislation.

Section 230 states that ""no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.""

NBC NEWS UNDER FIRE FOR APPARENTLY PUSHING GOOGLE TO REMOVE CONSERVATIVE SITES FROM AD PLATFORM

The section has been pivotal in the rise of today's social media giants by allowing not only Internet service providers –­ but also Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and others –­ to be shielded from liability from content posted on their platforms by third parties, in most cases.

But some critics feel that Google should no longer benefit from protections of Section 230 if the tech giant will not extend the same protections to other sites — and Google did not offer those protections to The Federalist.

President Trump also signed an executive order in May that could remove some big tech protections if companies engage in ""selective censorship"" harmful to national discourse. The order came shortly after Twitter attached fact-check warnings to some of the president's tweets.

""Section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike,"" the executive order stated.

BRITISH ACTIVISTS BEHIND NBC NEWS REPORT PUSHING GOOGLE TO DEMONETIZE THE FEDERALIST

""Critics says Section 230 gives tech companies too much power over what is and is not allowed on their sites. Supporters — including a wide range of Internet companies, free-speech advocates and open-Internet proponents — say that without the law, online communication would be stifled and social media as we know it would cease to exist,"" Washington Post's Rachel Lerman wrote last month when reporting the executive order.

Section 230 has many defenders in its current state, and Trump's attempts to alter how social media platforms are regulated have been met with resistance. For example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation calls Section 230 ""one of the most valuable tools for protecting freedom of expression and innovation on the Internet.""

However, Google's move to force The Federalist to remove its comments section or risk being demonetized has raised new questions.

MSNBC REPORTER BLASTED ON-AIR FOR DESCRIBING CHOP AS 'STREET FESTIVAL'

Google controls the majority of online advertising and essentially has the ability to dictate what media organizations can publish, because they depend on the tech giant for revenue.

""If you’re in the news business, you obey Google. When Google tells you to do something, you do it. You have no choice. They can bankrupt you in a minute,"" Fox News' Tucker Carlson explained on Tuesday.

For that reason, critics of Section 230 think Google is the key reason why changes need to take place.

WHAT IS SECTION 230?

""Google makes one of the strongest arguments yet for Section 230 reform,"" Federal Communications Commission head Brendan Carr tweeted Tuesday to kick off a series of messages.

The latest calls for Section 230 reform came after NBC News reported on Tuesday that Google was allegedly removing two conservative news sites from its ad platform.

HAWLEY INTRODUCES BILL TARGETING BIG TECH COMPANIES OVER POLITICAL CENSORSHIP CONCERNS

NBC News reported that Google was taking action against both The Federalist and ZeroHedge for articles that apparently ""pushed unsubstantiated claims"" about the Black Lives Matter movement and violated the search engine's policies that forbid the monetization of sites that provide ""derogatory content.""

Google insisted however that The Federalist was ""never demonetized"" and that it was the site's comments section that was in question, not any articles published by the site. ZeroHedge had already been demonetized.

As a result, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced legislation Wednesday to give Americans the ability to sue major tech companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter if they engage in selective censorship of political speech.

The Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act, cosponsored by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Mike Braun, R-Ind., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., would stop such companies from receiving immunity under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, unless they update their terms of service to promise to operate in good faith.

""For too long, Big Tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook have used their power to silence political speech from conservatives without any recourse for users,"" Hawley said in a statement. ""Section 230 has been stretched and rewritten by courts to give these companies outlandish power over speech without accountability. Congress should act to ensure bad actors are not given a free pass to censor and silence their opponents.""

The bill would allow users to sue companies for breaching that contractual duty of good faith, and it would make them pay $5,000 plus legal fees to each user who prevails in a case against them.

The Phoenix Mercury start the 2022 WNBA season in a few weeks and, while the game-planning will be centered around the Las Vegas Aces, Brittney Griner’s detention in Russia will weigh heavily on the players' minds.

Sophie Cunningham, who along with Griner helped the Mercury get to the WNBA Finals last season, was among those who talked about the star center being absent from the team.

""We’ve just got to keep praying for her,"" Cunningham said Monday. ""We hope she’s well. That’s all we know, you guys know as much as we do. No one wants to be in her situation. We miss her like crazy.""

Cunningham emphasized she was worried for Griner as a human being, not about how her absence will affect the team going forward.

""It’s BG, there’s no one like her in the whole world. We definitely miss her, but it’s not even about basketball anymore. We just want her to be well as a human being. She has a big stage, a lot of people know her, so we want her to be on the court,"" she added. ""Everyone who loves her just wants her to be home safe.""

""BG"" is the nickname given to Griner by her teammates and those around the WNBA.

Griner was arrested in February after Russian officials said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis.

Griner could face up to a decade in prison if she’s convicted.

BRITTNEY GRINER ARREST IN RUSSIA: STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS WNBA STAR 'DOING AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED'

""I definitely wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, worrying about BG,"" first-year Mercury coach Vanessa Nygaard said.

Players also have been worried about saying the wrong thing and escalating the situation even further.

""I spent 10 years there, so I know the way things work,"" Diana Taurasi said. ""It’s delicate.""

Griner’s arrest also sparked calls for a change in salaries to keep players from leaving the country during the winter months to play basketball overseas.

A supermax salary in the WNBA could earn a player just over $221,000 for the regular season. Players have the option to stay in the U.S. and do other media work in the offseason, but some choose to go to other countries, like Russia, where they could earn around $1 million or more.

Nygard hoped the financial discrepancies would come to an end.

""I see people all the time, they're like ‘Man, I can’t believe they don't pay those WNBA players. I can't believe they're underpaid.’ Well, when was the last time you bought season tickets? When is the last time you bought gear for WNBA?"" Nygaard said.

626,"Protesters recall violent attack outside Turkish Embassy in Washington, DC",Andrew O'Reilly,"

Ceren Borazan was sure she was going to die on Tuesday.

The 26-year-old Kurdish graduate student, who was in Washington, D.C., to protest Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to the White House, was one of about two dozen people demonstrating outside the country’s embassy on Sheridan Circle late Tuesday afternoon when supporters of Turkey’s controversial leader and allegedly members of his security force pushed past police and violently attacked the protesters.

Borazan tried to flee the ensuing melee, but was grabbed by one of Erdogan’s purported security guards and put in a headlock so tight that one of the blood vessels in her eyes popped.

“He held me and threatened to kill me,” Borazan told Fox News. “I know this guy wanted to hurt me or that he wanted to kill me.”

While Borazan said that her memory of the struggle is hazy, she added that she was somehow able to escape from her captor’s clutches and find help from a nearby driver who let her hide inside his car.

“I was lucky enough to get in that car and hide,” she said. “That guy saved my life.”

Borazan was able to escape the attack relatively unharmed physically, but a number of her fellow demonstrators were not so lucky.

Authorities in Washington, D.C., said that at least nine people were injured in the attack with two seriously injured and requiring an ambulance to take them to the hospital.

A Voice of America video showed police officers struggling to protect the protesters and ordering the men in suits to retreat. Instead, several of the men dodged the officers and ran into the park to continue the attacks.

The video also shows the attackers kicking one woman as she lay curled on a sidewalk, wrenching another woman's neck and throwing her to the ground and kicking the face of a man carrying a bullhorn.

“I am an American citizen. I didn’t expect something like this to happen here,” Abbas Aziz, a 62-year-old Kurdish teacher, told Fox News.

Four of the attackers ganged up on Aziz – knocking him to the ground with punches to the head and repeatedly kicking him in the chest and head before police drove them away.

“This is Washington, D.C., this is America,” Aziz said. “This is not Ankara, this is not Turkey.”

Many of the demonstrators attacked earlier this week are calling for charges to be brought against the attackers. Two men were arrested at the scene, and police intend to pursue charges against others involved, but the Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham said during a press conference on Wednesday that there may be issues with diplomatic immunity.

The White House has so far remained quiet on the incident with Press Secretary Sean Spicer referring reporters to the State Department and declining to comment further.

""Violence is never an appropriate response to free speech, and we support the rights of people everywhere to free expression and peaceful protest,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. ""We are communicating our concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms.""

A number of lawmakers in Washington condemned the violence with one senior Republican senator calling for Turkey's ambassador to be thrown out of the country.

""This is the United States of America. We do not do this here,"" Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., commented while retweeting the video. ""There is no excuse for this kind of thuggish behavior.""

Both the Turkish officials and Turkish state-media both reported a much different version of the attack, with the country’s embassy in Washington, D.C., releasing a statement that blamed the violence on the demonstrators. The statement said the demonstrators were ""aggressively provoking Turkish-American citizens who had peacefully assembled to greet the president. The Turkish-Americans responded in self-defense and one of them was seriously injured.""

Turkey's official Anadolu news agency labeled the protesters Kurdish ""supporters of terror."" It said they chanted anti-Erdogan slogans, and that Erdogan's team moved in to disperse them because ""police did not heed to Turkish demands to intervene.""

The settlement could be one of the largest ever in the United States involving a Catholic diocese and will allow the plaintiffs to sue insurance companies related to the diocese, as well as schools and parishes, according to The New York Times.

""This settlement with the Bishop of Camden is a powerful advance in accountability,"" Jeff Anderson, an attorney representing nearly a third of the 300-some accusers, said. ""The credit goes to the survivors for standing up for themselves and the truth.""

The diocese has 62 parishes and around 500,000 congregants, according to the Times.

The diocese had filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after the lawsuits were filed.

The settlement would set up a trust for the alleged victims who could get up to $290,000 each and would require ""enhancing"" protocols to keep children safe from abuse.

632,"Orsolya Gaal murder: Handyman David Bonola had 'intimate' relationship with slain woman, NYPD says",Stephanie Pagones,"

NEW YORK – Queens mom Orsolya Gaal and her killer were arguing inside her family’s home in the early morning hours of the day she was fatally stabbed, when the suspect – identified as 44-year-old family handyman David Bonola – tried to convince her to rekindle their ""intimate"" relationship, NYPD official confirmed Thursday.

Bonola, who had worked for Gaal and her family over the course of the past two years, confessed to parts of the gruesome crime and made further incriminating statements during interviews with NYPD investigators late Wednesday. He was charged early Thursday morning with murder, criminal tampering and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.

""We believe the relationship that Mr. Bonola had with our victim was a intimate-type relationship and this stemmed to be a domestic-type dispute that they were having over their intimate relationship,"" said NYPD Lt. Tommy Thompson from the Queens North Homicide squad.

Gaal, a 51-year-old married mother of two, was found murdered and stuffed into one of her son’s hockey bags on Saturday morning, less than a mile from her Forest Hill home.

MURDERED NYC MOM ORSOLYA GAAL: NYPD ARRESTS 44-YEAR-OLD DAVID BONOLA IN GRUESOME QUEENS SLAYING

Police said they received a call around 8:10 a.m. Saturday for a report of ""a suspicious bag with blood on it at the corner of Metropolitan Avenue and Jackie Robinson Parkway.""

Investigators also found a blood trail that led them back to the family’s home. One of Gaal's sons was home at the time of the murder, and was questioned by authorities but was later released.

Meanwhile, her 53-year-old husband, Howard Klein, was with their other son on the West Coast.

Surveillance footage from around 4:30 a.m. that day appeared to show a figure pulling a similar-looking bag along the sidewalk, sources confirmed.

Gaal attended a show at Lincoln Center on Friday night and then rode the train to the Forest Hills neighborhood, where she stopped in a local watering hole around 11:20 p.m., police said.

She returned to her Juno Street home in Forest Hills around 12:20 a.m. Saturday. Police say she either let Bonola into the home or he used a spare key that was hidden in the barbeque about 10 to 20 minutes later, police said. One of the woman’s sons was on an upper floor at the time.

Gaal and Bonola then went down to the basement, where they began arguing, police officials said. Bonola allegedly went to the home that evening ""to speak about the relationship again.""

""A heated argument ensues between the two in the basement. A knife is brandished. A violent struggle ensues, resulting in our victim being stabbed ruthlessly and brutally in excess of 55 times, causing her demise,"" NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said.

Police said the murder weapon was then left behind at the crime scene.

""Mr. Bonola then retrieved the hockey bag belonging to Ms. Gaal's son, placed her in the bag and as video showed, was seen rolling the body down the sidewalks, leaving a bloody trail through the streets of Forest Hills,"" Essig continued. Police believe he then fled to Forest Park, ""where investigators discovered the jacket believed to be worn by him during this vicious crime.""

He said detectives also developed leads that pointed them to a location ""where boots, a T-shirt and bloody bandages were discovered."" They learned he was treated for hand wounds at an area hospital, Essig said.

Investigators said the pair had been off and on, and they had broken up prior but had reunited in the month of April."" At the time of the murder, their relationship had been considered ""at an end,"" police said. Their on-and-off relationship went on for two years, cops said.

Essig said Bonola made ""incriminating statements."" Investigators further described how his ""confession"" included an admission that he had sent a chilling text message from the victim’s cell phone.

The message, as reported by WPIX, stated: ""Your wife sent me to jail some years ago when you were living near Austin Street in Forest Hills. I'm back, don't call the police or I will kill your family.""

The NYPD said Thursday they believe the contents of the message to be completely bogus.

""We have it from, in the confession, that he sent that message,"" an NYPD executive said. ""We don’t believe there was any danger to the family.""

Investigators further described how they believe Bonola moved the victim’s body because he did not want the family to find it. And said the knife used in the crime was ""consistent with knives that are in the home.""

633,CNN+ streaming service to shut down after just one month,Brian Flood,"

Warner Bros. Discovery has pulled the plug on CNN+ after the network’s recently launched streaming service failed to resonate with viewers. It will cease operations on April 30.

""As we become Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN will be strongest as part of WBD’s streaming strategy which envisions news as an important part of a compelling broader offering along with sports, entertainment, and nonfiction content,"" CNN Worldwide CEO Chris Licht said in a statement.

‘SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS’ AT CNN AMID RATINGS WOES, AND LOOMING REGIME CHANGE AND ‘SUBOPTIMAL’ STREAMER

""We have therefore made the decision to cease operations of CNN+ and focus our investment on CNN’s core news-gathering operations and in further building CNN Digital,"" Licht continued. ""This is not a decision about quality; we appreciate all of the work, ambition and creativity that went into building CNN+, an organization with terrific talent and compelling programming. But our customers and CNN will be best served with a simpler streaming choice.""

The decision comes after widespread speculation that CNN’s new parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, would scale back or eliminate the service after a long-planned merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia was completed earlier this month. Many industry insiders have wondered why CNN even launched the service when the merger was looming.

On March 28, CNN threw a swanky launch party for CNN+ on the eve of its highly publicized premiere. Executives, on-air personalities and reporters who are friendly to CNN attended the soiree at an event space located on the 101st floor of Hudson Yards, overlooking Manhattan. WarnerMedia and Discovery completed the merger on April 8.

CNN+ customers will receive prorated refunds of subscription fees, the company announced.

The failed service was the brainchild of former CNN president Jeff Zucker and former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who are no longer with the company.

CNN’S JOHN HARWOOD ROASTED FOR CLAIMING THERE IS ‘ZERO EVIDENCE’ TYING BIDEN TO HIS SON’S WRONGDOINGS

A spokesperson for Zucker declined comment when reached by Fox News Digital.

Licht and Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav have been expected to shift CNN away from the far-left programming strategy that was prominent during the Zucker regime, but CNN+ was loaded with liberal pundits including Rex Chapman and Jemele Hill. It also featured former Fox News host Chris Wallace, NPR host Audie Cornish and former NBC reporter Kasie Hunt, as well as actress and Democratic activist Eva Longoria.

The previous management team reportedly spent $100 million on development costs had roughly 500 employees working on the service. The Associated Press reported that ""some CNN+ content will wind up on other company networks"" and the streaming service’s employees ""will get opportunities to apply for jobs elsewhere inside Warner Bros. Discovery.""

CNN+ launched a month ago with little fanfare and was quickly mocked when leaked subscription data that revealed startlingly low numbers .

On the first day the new service was active, a guest on the platform criticized CNN itself for drifting away from straight news when original CNN anchor Dave Walker joined the inaugural edition of Zucker loyalist Brian Stelter’s new streaming show and declared he isn’t thrilled with the current state of the network.

""I used to anchor at CNN, and now I just yell at CNN,"" Walker said. ""I think originally, it was pretty much 99 percent news content … As cable news evolved and more competition came into the fray, you had more opinion, particularly in the evening hours. And I would say that’s the major difference now. But maybe with the new ownership that may revert to more just basic news coverage.""

CNN executive vice president and chief digital officer Andrew Morse, who oversaw the service, will exit the company.

""We are grateful to Andrew for his significant contributions to CNN Digital and CNN+ over the years,’’ Licht said. ""He and his team created a quality slate of rich and compelling content and helped produce and distribute CNN’s journalism around the world on a variety of platforms. We appreciate Andrew and everyone’s hard work and dedication.’’

Morse said it was ""an honor to work alongside the world’s best journalists these past nine years"" in a statement.

""I am a great believer that change is critical – for individuals and for organizations. As the company enters an exciting period of change, it is a logical time to make a change for myself. I’ll always be rooting for CNN,"" Morse said.

MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd claimed Wednesday that if Jesus Christ were still on the Earth today, he would be called a ""groomer,"" ""woke,"" and a ""socialist.""

The former advisor to the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign who recently ran for Lt. Governor of Texas as a Democrat made the egregious statement during an appearance on ""Deadline: White House"" while discussing accusations of ""grooming"" against a Democratic Michigan state senator.

MSNBC HIRES FAILED DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE AFTER HIS SHORT-LIVED CAMPAIGN

Before turning to Dowd during the discussion, host Nicolle Wallace played a video clip of Michigan Democrat state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who was accused by Republican state Sen. Lana Theis of wanting to ""groom"" and ""sexualize"" young children in schools and teach them about critical race theory, as she discussed the accusations against her on ""Morning Joe.""

After the clip, Dowd argued that the country was facing a ""culture war"" against Republicans, and that Democrats would lose elections if they didn't step up and speak out for ""marginalized"" communities. He also praised McMorrow for ""fighting"" for school children by advocating teaching controversial topics in schools.

Wallace then turned the discussion to faith, citing McMorrow in claiming that some were using the ""perversion"" of faith as a ""political cudgel"" in debates over policies affecting children.

MATTHEW DOWD SNAPS AT CNN ANCHOR FOR REPEATEDLY ASKING ABOUT WHY HE DELETED THOUSANDS OF TWEETS

""This is something that I have tried to talk about: Being a Christian, having grown up Catholic, having been an altar boy and all of that – how the faith has been captured by a small segment of our society who have tried to define it in a way that Jesus never had defined it, and actually the opposite way of Jesus,"" Dowd claimed.

""The entire message of the gospels of the Easter holidays was love one another. And I have said this before, and I'll say it again: If Jesus Christ was alive today, He would be called a groomer, He would be called woke, and He would be called a socialist if He was alive today,"" he added.

""If He was speaking the message He spoke in the gospels today about treating everybody with dignity – Jesus Christ hung around with prostitutes and tax collectors. He was nailed to a cross because He spoke on behalf of the most marginalized people in the Middle East,"" he said.

Dowd lamented the idea that some people were trying ""to capture"" Christianity and ""corrupt"" its message. He then called on people of all religions or none to push the message that ""love conquers hate.""

Neither Wallace nor any of the other guests appearing with Dowd pushed back on his claims regarding Jesus.

638,Kenosha meeting discussing memorial for man shot by Rittenhouse gets heated: 'Like a lunatic',Jon Brown,"

The five-person Kenosha Parks Commission in Kenosha, Wisconsin, tabled a proposal Monday that would have placed a memorial tree and plaque in a city park to honor one of the men Kyle Rittenhouse killed.

Several Kenosha residents showed up at the heated meeting to voice their opposition to the memorial for Anthony Huber, who is seen on video chasing Rittenhouse and swinging a skateboard at him before Rittenhouse shot him in the chest on Aug. 25, 2020.

Huber's girlfriend Hannah Gittings requested on April 5 that a memorial marker be placed in Huber's memory at a flowering dogwood in Anderson Park, according to public documents attached to the committee's agenda reviewed by Fox News Digital.

KENOSHA PARKS COMMISSION TO CONSIDER REQUEST FOR MEMORIAL HONORING MAN FATALLY SHOT BY KYLE RITTENHOUSE

The proposal began to gain attention when Kevin Mathewson, a former Kenosha alderman who now works as an investigative journalist, noticed early Monday morning that it had been attached to the commission's agenda and wrote about it on his website, Kenosha County Eye.

Mathewson, a controversial figure in Kenosha, made headlines in 2020 for having started an organization called the Kenosha Guard, an armed group that said in a Facebook post it intended ""to deter rioting/looting."" On the day of the Rittenhouse shootings, Mathewson urged on the group's Facebook page for Kenoshans to defend their city by taking to the streets with guns, according to The New York Times.

Mathewson, who attended the commission meeting on Monday, told Fox News Digital he is concerned that the commission's move to table the proposal instead of voting it down leaves the door open for them to quietly pass it in the future.

In an exchange that begins roughly 21 minutes into video of the meeting, Mathewson accused the aldermen of violating Wisconsin's open meetings laws against a ""walking quorum"" by discussing their decision to table the proposal before the meeting.

Alderman Eric Haugaard, who chairs the commission and said he was in favor of tabling the proposal because of an ongoing lawsuit between Kenosha and Huber's family, repeatedly slammed his gavel in response to Mathewson and said he was misconstruing what happened.

""I know you don't want to hear it, and you want to slam the gavel like a lunatic,"" Mathewson told Haugaard. ""Doesn't change what you did was wrong.""

Haugaard did not respond to request for comment in time for publication.

""They have all spoken publicly against Kyle Rittenhouse,"" Mathewson said of the members of the commission. ""They think that he shouldn't have been out there, and it was terrible that he shot these poor innocent people who are just protesting police brutality.""

Describing the commission as ""toe-the-line, card-carrying Democrats who want to appeal to their districts,"" Mathewson believes the proposal would have passed if members of the community had not shown up to voice their disapproval.

""I think those five members want the tree and the plaque to go up, but they don't want the ramifications from the voters,"" said Mathewson, who explained that by tabling the proposal instead of voting it down, they will be able to attach it to another agenda at the last minute and pass it later.

""That's happened before many times with a variety of things in the city of Kenosha and probably every city around the country,"" he said. ""It's just a trick. It's politicking.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""It's unprecedented what happened to our city a couple of summers ago,"" Mathewson said. ""And to memorialize a man who lived a life of violence and crime, and who was one of the ones contributing to the rioting and looting is just unfathomable.""

""It was offensive to the city of Kenosha taxpayers even to consider it, in my opinion,"" he added.",https://www.foxnews.com
639,Putin's war on verge of expanding outside Ukraine as it cries 'terrorism' in Moldova,Caitlin Mcfall,"

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s deadly war in Europe is on the brink of expanding outside of Ukraine as Kremlin officials alleged Thursday that there have been ""acts of terrorism"" in Moldova.

Moscow set its sights on Moldova last week when a Russian general said its goal was to gain ""full control"" over not only eastern Ukraine, but regions along its southern that sit above the Black Sea.

TREVOR REED LANDS IN US AFTER PRISONER SWAP WITH RUSSIA

This would allow Russia to gain better access to Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway state in Moldova with sympathetic ties to Russia.

""We are alarmed by the escalation of tension in Transnistria, where in recent days there have been several incidents of shelling, blowing up social and infrastructure facilities,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday. ""We regard these actions as acts of terrorism aimed at destabilizing the situation.""

Zakharova’s comments came after explosions were reported in the separatist region this week, one reportedly hitting the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.

A second target was reported Tuesday after radio antennas that broadcast Russian programs in Maiac, a town around seven miles from Moldova’s border with Ukraine, were struck down.

But despite a history of tense relations, Moldova and Transnistria have held a treaty agreement since 1992 and signs of a thawing Cold War mentality were evident even earlier this year.

As part of the 1992 peace treaty, Russia has maintained a presence in Transnistria with roughly 1,500 Russian troops stationed there as ""peacekeepers.""

ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WILL LIKELY INVADE OTHER COUNTRIES IF SUCCESSFUL IN UKRAINE

The similarities shared by the Moldovan breakaway region and the Ukrainian self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in the Donbas – which served as Putin’s justification for his illegal invasion in February – has many concerned.

Reports surfaced this week suggesting that officials in the region suspect Russia was behind the attacks in Transnistria as a guise to support a second illegal invasion.

""We strongly condemn attempts to involve Transnistria in what is happening in Ukraine,"" Russia’s spokesperson claimed Thursday. ""Every now and then sensational statements are heard from there about the preparation of Russian peacekeepers, the Tiraspol airfield, Transnistria conscripts for some kind of offensive actions.

""But all these statements do not cast doubt on the fact that the situation on the left bank of the Dniester, including in the security zone, is reliably controlled by the joint peacekeeping forces,"" she added.

Representatives for McCarthy did not immediately respond to whether he backs this bill or efforts to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which Boebert also wants. Scalise supports Boebert's bill.

Both Scalise and McCarthy recently signed onto a letter questioning Mayorkas' suitability for office but didn't specifically raise impeachment.

The issue is a newly announced Disinformation Governance Board that DHS says will counter disinformation from Russia and misinformation circulated by human smugglers to get migrants to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the Associated Press. Nina Jankowicz, who previously served as a disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center, will head the board as executive director.

Republicans – already leery of censorship following Big Tech's efforts to shut down the New York Post's story on Hunter Biden's laptop after Democrats labeled it Russian disinformation – were aghast at the new department.

""No tax dollars should go to where Biden can use the power of the federal government to silence truthful stories like Big Tech did with the Hunter Biden story,"" Boebert said.

Boebert compared the effort to government surveillance from George Orwell's ""1984"" novel.

""Democrats took that [book] not as a warning, but as a guide,"" she said.

""For anyone who's critical of it, I didn't hear them being critical of the work under the former president, which is interesting to note contextually,"" Psaki said as she outlined a fact sheet released by the department that explains the board's mission.

""This is work that is helping to address unauthorized terrorism, other threats, and see how disinformation, misinformation is being pushed, to lead, to increase those, so that's all work that we think has been ongoing for some time,"" Psaki said.

646,Biden official says food shortages will push farmers to green energy: 'Never let a crisis go to waste',Kristine Parks,"

A top Biden official said Sunday that the global food shortage crisis would push farmers toward relying on more green energy.

""Never let a crisis go to waste,"" U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Chief Samantha Power told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week.""

Speaking of the global consequences of Russia’s war with Ukraine, the Biden official said that fertilizer shortages would provide farmers the opportunity to ""hasten"" their ""transition"" from fertilizer to more ""natural"" resources.

ENERGY SEC. GRANHOLM: UKRAINE CRISIS PROVIDES ‘URGENT MOMENT’ FOR CONGRESS TO ACT ON ‘CLEAN ENERGY’

""Fertilizer shortages are real now because Russia is a big exporter of fertilizer. Even though fertilizer is not sanctioned, less fertilizer is coming out of Russia,"" she explained. ""As a result we're working with countries to think about natural solutions like manure and compost and this may hasten transitions that would have been in the interest of farmers to make eventually anyway. So never let a crisis go to waste.""

Power added that the administration was still asking Congress to pass more relief. Last week, President Biden requested an additional $33 billion from Congress for military and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.

""But we really do need this financial support from the Congress to be able to meet emergency food needs, so we don't see the cascading deadly effects of Russia's war extend into Africa and beyond,"" she said.

President Biden's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm made similar remarks back in March, pushing for Congress to use this crisis to pass ""clean energy"" legislation and to ""wean off"" fossil fuels.

""This crisis in Europe, and the crisis our allies are facing and the reduction of supply of natural gas and oil from Russia creates a moment that we should be acting,"" she said at a clean energy summit.

In March, President Biden warned there were going to be ""real"" food shortages, following U.S. sanctions placed on Russia due to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

""With regard to food shortage, yes we did talk about food shortages, and it's gonna be real,"" Biden said to the press at a NATO summit in Belgium.

Florida mom and mental health professional January Littlejohn and her attorney Vernadette Broyles discussed the lawsuit and why she is ""outraged"" over the incident.

""This is happening all over the nation,"" Littlejohn warned on ""Fox & Friends First"" on Monday. ""This same protocol is in place in many, many schools across districts everywhere, and even the guides being used to dictate these transgender support plans that cut parents out even have the same language.""

""So this is a very systematic way that parents are being excluded from important decisions occurring with their children, and further, social transition is a medical intervention that schools are grossly unqualified to be taking these steps without parental involvement,"" she continued.

REPUBLICANS PUSH CARDONA ON REPORTS OF 12-YEAR-OLD'S SUICIDE ATTEMPT FOLLOWING SECRET SCHOOL GENDER TALKS

According to Littlejohn, her daughter, who was 13 years old at the time, expressed confusion over gender during the pandemic after a group of friends transitioned to the opposite sex.

She eventually found out the school was working on a ""transgender support plan"" with her child, but the school initially declined to allow her involvement given she was ""protected by a nondiscrimination law.""

""Eventually we did see the transgender support plan, which was a six-page document that they completed with my daughter, that was 13 at the time behind closed doors, where they asked her questions that would have absolutely impacted her safety, such as which restroom she preferred to use and which sex she preferred to room with on overnight field trips,"" Littlejohn said.

Hunter Biden was reportedly paid $83,333 per month after being hired in 2014 by Burisma Holdings, one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas companies, while serving as a non-executive “ceremonial figure” with a “powerful name,” a report said Friday.

All told, the Ukraine company paid $3.4 million to Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, a company headed by Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer, The National Review reported.

Between April 2014 and November 2015, Biden and Archer each received monthly payments of $83,333 for “consulting services.""

HUNTER BIDEN'S QUESTIONABLE PAST AND BUSINESS DEALINGS COULD UNDO DAD'S BID FOR WHITE HOUSE

Burisma Holdings founder Mykola Zlochevsky hired the son of former Vice President Joe Biden to ""protect"" the company in the face of prosecution, the Review reported.

Zlochevsky faced investigation in Ukraine and was initially cleared of wrongdoing for tax violations, money laundering and corruption. But earlier this month Ukrainian Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said 15 cases involving Zlochevsky would be reviewed, according to The National Review.

Biden’s work with the company has come under scrutiny after President Trump alleged that Joe Biden inappropriately used his diplomatic influence in Ukraine to help his son.

No evidence of wrongdoing has been found and both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden deny the allegations. Hunter Biden has since pledged to avoid business deals with foreign entities if his father becomes president.

A July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked his counterpart to investigate the Bidens -- led the Democrat-controlled House to start the Trump impeachment inquiry earlier this month.

654,EU punishes Hungary with unprecedented action,Caleb Parke,"

Using unprecedented disciplinary action, the European Parliament voted Wednesday to sanction Hungary, saying the country poses a “systemic threat” to democracy and the rule of law.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has been accused of breaching the EU’s core values in areas of migration, rule of law, and the media – which he denies.

It was the first move of its kind in the EU against a member state, garnering two-thirds of the votes.

If approved by national leaders, Hungary is set to face punitive measures. The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary’s voting rights in the EU, is unlikely as Poland is set to veto that move.

Dutch MEP Judith Sargentini led the process and received a standing ovation after the result was announced.

“The Hungarian people deserve better,” Sargentini said. “They deserve freedom of speech, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice and equality, all of which are enshrined in the European treaties.”

The Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, called the vote “petty revenge” against his country’s tough anti-migration policies.

The vote involved “massive fraud”, Szijjártó claimed, since abstentions weren’t counted in the final tally, which made it easier to reach the needed majority.

On Tuesday, Orban said his country was being targeted for choosing not to be “a country of migrants” as he dismissed charges of corruption.",https://www.foxnews.com
655,Growing number of U.S. states reporting mysterious hepatitis outbreaks among children,Shiv Sudhakar,"

After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a national health alert regarding a mysterious cluster of severe hepatitis in pediatric patients in Alabama, at least ten additional states are reporting similar cases that are now part of larger international outbreak, according to an ABC7 Chicago report .

The children are between the ages of 1 month to 16 years old with typical symptoms of acute hepatitis, including jaundice, abdominal pain and diarrhea.

The CDC reported the first cases in Alabama did not have significant medical problems, and ranged from ages younger than two to older than five years old, with five out of nine patients contracting adenovirus type 41, the virus known to cause the common cold.

But the agency noted the liver biopsies from the six patients who showed varying degree of hepatitis did not reveal any evidence of adenovirus on pathology, according to a recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .

Researchers are investigating a possible link to adenovirus, but out of the 50 known types of adenoviruses, type 41 usually causes only respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, not severe hepatitis, so investigations are also looking into other viruses, environmental toxins and medications that can cause severe hepatitis in children, per the news outlet .

NYC COVID-19 CASES, ALERT LEVEL RISE

Minnesota is one of the latest states to report several cases, with M Health Fairview reporting two cases to Minnesota Department of Health involving an infant and a 2 year old, one who was treated several months ago while the other who required a liver transplant, according to KSTP-TV .

""Why this kid had such severe acute hepatitis is unknown,"" said Dr. Heli Bhatt, pediatric gastroenterologist and transplant hepatologist at M Health Fairview.

""It was kind of fitting enough for me to let Minnesota Department of Health know and they are going to investigate the case further .""

Wisconsin reported the first death possibly linked to the outbreak last week, per a recent release .

Other states include: Delaware and Louisiana, with each reporting one, North Carolina with two, three in Illinois, six in Tennessee and a ""handful"" in New York and Georgia, per the New York Post .

California is also investigating seven cases, with the first case reported this past October, per the San Francisco Chronicle .

""We do not know yet if adenovirus played a role in these rare illnesses or if these cases are connected,"" said Ali Bay, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Public Health .

""While only a few cases of this rare illness have been reported, we urge parents and guardians to take common sense general measures to prevent infection and illness, such as good hand hygiene, covering coughs and sneezes, and keeping children home from school or childcare while they are ill .""

AT LEAST 228 PROBABLY CASES OF CHILD HEPATITIS SO FAR: WHO

The World Health Organization have reported at least 169 cases in 12 countries, including at least one death and 17 others requiring a liver transplant. The majority of the cases are in the United Kingdom, per the April 23 release .

""One potential important clue that has not been reported yet is the pathology of the liver [from patients in Europe]. The 17 liver transplant cases across several countries means that a detailed analysis of the microscopic histopathology of the liver in these cases is available,"" said Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, clinical professor of medicine at Dartmouth Geisel Medical School and a member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Global Health Committee .

Adenovirus was detected in 74 of these cases worldwide, but SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was identified in 20 cases, with the common viruses that usually cause acute viral hepatitis ruled out .

Trinh Nguyen, 38, was arrested hours later in a church parking lot and had apparently tried to commit suicide.

Authorities were originally called to Nguyen's home in Upper Makefield Township, Pennsylvania, around 7:00 a.m. on reports of an armed subject.

A 22-year-old neighbor told officers that Nguyen approached and asked him to give a box of photos to her ex-husband, then attempted to fire a black revolver at his face twice, but the gun did not fire.

The neighbor was able to disarm Nguyen, who then jumped in a white Toyota Sienna minivan and fled the area.

One of the officers then entered the home with a neighbor and found her two sons, ages 13 and 9, in their beds with gunshot wounds to their heads.

659,Judge accepts Derek Chauvin plea deal in George Floyd federal civil rights case,Danielle Wallace,"

A federal judge on Wednesday accepted the terms of Derek Chauvin’s plea deal.

U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson, handling the federal civil rights trial against four former Minneapolis police officers in the killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, accepted the terms of Chauvin’s plea agreement and will sentence him to 20 to 25 years in prison, the Associated Press reported.

Chauvin pleaded guilty Dec. 15 to violating Floyd’s civil rights, admitting for the first time that he kept his knee on Floyd’s neck — even after he became unresponsive — resulting in the Black man’s death on May 25, 2020. The White former officer admitted he willfully deprived Floyd of his right to be free from unreasonable seizure, including unreasonable force by a police officer.

MINNEAPOLIS POLICE ENGAGED IN PATTERN OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION: STATE INVESTIGATION

Under the plea agreement, which Chauvin signed, both sides agreed Chauvin should face a sentence ranging from 20 to 25 years, with prosecutors saying they would seek 25. He could have faced life in prison on the federal count. With credit for good time in the federal system, he would serve from 17 years to 21 years and three months behind bars.

Magnuson deferred accepting the agreement pending the completion of a presentence investigation. He said in a one-page order Wednesday that the report had been issued, so it was now appropriate to accept the deal. He has not set a sentencing date for Chauvin.

Chauvin is already serving a 22 1/2 year sentence for his murder conviction in state court last year, though he is appealing that conviction. He would serve the federal sentence concurrently with the state sentence.

The federal plea deal means Chauvin will probably spend more time in prison than he faced under his state sentence, according to The Associated Press. State prisoners in Minnesota typically serve one-third of their sentence on parole, which for him would mean 15 years in prison.

Chauvin waived his right to contest his federal conviction if Magnuson accepted the plea agreement.

Magnuson also has not set sentencing dates for three other ex-officers who were convicted of related federal civil rights charges in February. The presentence investigations for Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng are still underway. They're scheduled to go on trial next month in state court on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin in Floyd's murder.

Prosecutors revealed at a pretrial hearing last month that the three had rejected plea agreements on the state charges. Terms were not disclosed. Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, said it was hard for the defense to negotiate when the three still didn’t know what their federal sentences would be.

Taliban fighters took the Afghan capital city of Kabul faster than anyone anticipated earlier this month – including the Taliban – but according to a Washington Post report, the U.S. had an opportunity to hold the city only to willingly turn it over.

When Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani fled the country, the city began to collapse as gangs were reported to be taking over. This led to U.S. military leaders meeting and reaching an agreement with the Taliban, a U.S. official told the Post.

""We have two options to deal with it,"" Taliban political leader Abdul Ghani Baradar reportedly said, according to the official. ""You [the United States military] take responsibility for securing Kabul or you have to allow us to do it.""

Faced with the decision of whether to accept control over Kabul or allow the Taliban to do so, the U.S. opted for the latter, given President Biden’s insistence on withdrawing from Afghanistan by August 31. As part of the agreement, the U.S. assumed control of Kabul’s airport until the end of the month to facilitate its exit while the Taliban ruled the city.

According to the Post’s report, the Taliban had no intention of taking control of Kabul that day. Prior to Ghani’s departure, the U.S. had not anticipated it either, as several top officials had reportedly been on vacation.

The chaos that ensued when Ghani left, however, required someone to step in. The U.S. decided that it should be the Taliban.

Taliban commander Muhammad Nasir Haqqani was surprised by the outcome. After he and his men reached the city they awaited instructions. Later that day they went in and occupied the palace in under an hour.

663,Liberal group calls for protests at conservative Supreme Court justices' homes,Anders Hagstrom,"

Left-wing activist groups are planning to send protesters to the homes of conservative Supreme Court justices following a leak indicating the court may soon overturn Roe v. Wade.

The activists are organizing under the moniker ""Ruth Sent Us"" and have published the supposed home addresses of Justices Amy Coney Barrett, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.

""Our 6-3 extremist Supreme Court routinely issues rulings that hurt women, racial minorities, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights,"" the group's website reads. ""We must rise up to force accountability using a diversity of tactics.""

Fox News is told there has been a strong police presence at the justices' homes following the leak. The group says they will visit the homes on May 11.

The D.C. Police Department has erected fencing around the Supreme Court building in anticipation of escalating protests this weekend. Police have also activated protest-response units through Sunday.

The move comes after a draft copy of Justice Samuel Alito's opinion upholding a Mississippi abortion law leaked to Politico. The decision would overturn Roe v. Wade if adopted by four other justices.

Chief Justice John Roberts described the leak as a ""betrayal"" of the court on Tuesday and ordered an investigation into the incident.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have also expressed outrage over the nearly unprecedented leak, while Democrats have sounded the alarms in defense of abortion.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called for the leaker to be prosecuted, saying the move was a transparent attempt to subvert the court's ruling.

664,Putin apologizes to Israel following Lavrov's Hitler remarks,Caitlin Mcfall,"

Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett Thursday, for incendiary comments made by a top Kremlin official earlier this week, Jerusalem said.

A direct transcription of the call was not released, but a statement by the Israeli prime minister’s office said Bennett ""accepted President Putin's apology for Lavrov's remarks and thanked him for clarifying his attitude towards the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

A Russian readout of the phone call did not mention an apology but said both countries ""carefully preserve the historical truth about the events of those years and honor the memory of all the fallen, including victims of the Holocaust.""

""The President of Russia recalled that of the 6 million Jews tortured in ghettos and concentration camps, killed by the Nazis during punitive operations, 40% were citizens of the USSR, and asked to convey wishes of health and well-being to the veterans living in Israel,"" according to a translation of the readout from the Kremlin.

The apology comes just days after a spat between Moscow and Jerusalem erupted when Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defended claims made by Putin who has attempted to justify his illegal invasion into Ukraine.

Putin has repeatedly claimed that his ""special military operation"" into Ukraine is an attempt to ""denazify"" the country – alleging without proof that certain groups in Ukraine have been oppressed by Kyiv.

The international community and Ukraine have rejected these claims as a guise as Putin looks to gain territory in eastern Ukraine, pointing to the fact that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and was democratically elected.

""For some time we have heard from the Jewish people that the biggest antisemites were Jewish,"" Lavrov claimed in an interview with an Italian news outlet.

RUSSIA ESCALATES SPAT AND ACCUSES ISRAEL OF SUPPORTING 'NEO-NAZIS IN UKRAINE'

""When they say ‘How can Nazification exist if we’re Jewish?’ In my opinion, Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it doesn’t mean absolutely anything,"" he added.

Lavrov’s comments drew swift ire from Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid who called the comments ""unforgivable"" and a ""terrible historical error"" that minimized the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.

Western news outlets have since said there is little evidence to support Lavrov’s claims.

""Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust,"" the Israeli foreign minister said Monday. ""The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.""

But the spat continued when the Kremlin shot back Tuesday and accused the Israeli foreign minister of ""contradict[ing] history"" and accused Israel of supporting ""the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv.""

665,IG mulls probe into whether FBI retaliated against agents who attended Jan. 6 rally at the Capitol,Tyler O'Neil,"

FIRST ON FOX – Michael Horowitz, the inspector general of the Department of Justice, told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and Ranking Member Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, that he would consider launching an investigation into whether the FBI retaliated against agents who attended the Jan. 6, 2021, protest at the U.S. Capitol but who did not enter the building with rioters.

Jordan, citing FBI whistleblowers, urged Horowitz last month to investigate whistleblower claims that ""the FBI is suspending the security clearances of FBI employees for their participation in protected First Amendment activity on January 6, 2021."" Since a security clearance is required for FBI positions, ""these actions mean the FBI has suspended these employees indefinitely.""

JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT – ONE YEAR LATER, DC REMAINS ON EDGE

Jordan included the notice of suspension for one 10-year FBI employee who previously had honorably served in the U.S. military for more than 20 years. According to Jordan, the employees in question ""did not enter the United States Capitol, have not been charged with any crime, and have not been contacted by law enforcement about their actions.""

Even so, the FBI revoked their clearances, citing ""Adjudicative Guideline A – Allegiance to the United States."" T

his move appears to follow a Democratic tactic in conflating peaceful protesters on Jan. 6 with those who actively stormed the Capitol in an apparent attempt to prevent Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote for President Biden.

These moves ""raise concerns that the Bureau may be taking significant steps toward firing these employees as retaliation for disfavored political speech.""

Horowitz, in a May 4 letter obtained first by Fox News Digital, stopped short of pledging to launch an investigation into the issue, but he did say he would reach out to the FBI and consider whether to open an investigation.

""In view of the concern you have raised, we will ask the FBI to provide the bases for the security clearance and personnel actions taken against the employees you reference in your letter,"" Horowitz said in his letter Wednesday. ""Based on the information we receive, we will assess whether to conduct a further review.""

""In making such an assessment, we will also consider information about other employees who believe the FBI has taken administrative actions against them for engaging in protected activities on January 6, 2021,"" Horowitz added.

In his first April letter to the IG, Jordan noted that although the Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging in partisan political campaigns or political management, FBI employees do not give up their fundamental rights to participate in political speech activity.

666,Biden White House avoids Oval Office for press events in part because it has no teleprompter: report,Joseph Wulfsohn,"

Throughout the Biden presidency, the White House has rarely utilized the backdrop of the Oval Office for public events. And that's reportedly because the president's aides want him to stick to the script.

Politico published a report on Thursday about the potential 2024 ""rematch"" between President Biden and former President Trump. And the while no official announcement has been made with the exception of off-the-cuff remarks from Biden saying he intends to run again, it's ""all systems go"" inside the White House with aides and advisers ""taking initial steps to mount a bid"" despite ongoing health concerns and dismal polling.

BIDEN HAS ONLY DONE ONE MEDIA INTERVIEW SO FAR IN 2022

""He has little choice to say otherwise; an admission that he was making himself a lame duck would dramatically curb his political power,"" Politico wrote. ""Some Democrats have expressed private hope that Biden will make his final decision soon after this November’s midterms, giving the party plenty of time to prepare for what would likely be a wide-open primary if he opts not to run… On a personal level, moreover, acting promptly is not a Biden strength, sparking fear within the party that an announcement could be delayed until deep into 2023. The one factor that could hasten a decision and all but certainly ensure that Biden runs again: if Donald Trump says he will, too.""

As Politico noted, if Biden does choose to run again, his 2024 campaign would be more ""rigorous"" since much of his 2020 campaign took place in his Delaware home due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""Still, some allies and Democrats privately worry that Biden may not be able to handle the rigors of another campaign,"" Politico wrote. ""A bone he broke in his foot while playing with his dog in late November 2020 still occasionally bothers Biden, resulting in a slower and shorter gait. And the White House has largely abandoned using the Oval Office for press events in part because it can’t be permanently equipped with a teleprompter.""

POLITICO CALLS OUT BIDEN FOR NOT DOING INTERVIEWS: ‘REFLECTS THE BUNKER MENTALITY THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS TAKEN’

""Biden aides prefer the fake White House stage built in the Old Executive Office Building next door for events, sacrificing some of the power of the historic backdrop in favor of an otherwise sterile room that was outfitted with an easily read teleprompter screen,"" the report added.

The White House has been very guarded when it comes to President Biden's accessibility to the press.

He has only done one interview with a news organization so far in 2022.

In his first year in office, Biden did just 22 formal sit-downs, compared to Donald Trump's 92 and Barack Obama's 156, according to data from Towson University's White House Transition Project.

NEW YORK TIMES DRAWS ATTENTION TO BIDEN'S ‘LOW-KEY MEDIA STRATEGY,’ FUELING ‘CONCERN’ AMONG ALLIES'

The press has taken notice of Biden’s lack of availability for sit-down interviews, as Politico published a piece last year headlined, ""Why Biden's not doing interviews,"" which noted he conducted more formal interviews as vice president than he has through the same period of his current gig.

""Biden’s team is quick to note that he often takes questions from reporters after he does events. Allies of the president are even quicker to note that no one outside of the Washington press corps really cares about press access,"" Politico wrote in October. ""But the lack of interviews reflects the bunker mentality this White House has taken with the media — particularly the extensive back-and-forths where reporters can follow-up, push, and prod.""

In November, The New York Times drew attention to Biden's ""low-key media strategy,"" which had fueled ""concern"" among his allies.

""He has not sat for interviews with The Associated Press, The New York Times, Reuters, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal or USA Today. Even friendly venues like ‘The Late Show With Stephen Colbert’ have gone unvisited,"" the Times noted, though Biden did sit down with Times columnist David Brooks.

The Associated Press also knocked Biden earlier this year for having ""shied away"" from news conferences and interviews during his first year in office.

""The dynamic has the White House facing questions about whether Biden, who vowed to have the most transparent administration in the nation’s history, is falling short in pulling back the curtain on how his administration operates and missing opportunities to explain his agenda,"" the AP wrote in January.",https://www.foxnews.com
667,"Chicago man robbed, shot three times in upscale Lincoln Park neighborhood",Audrey Conklin,"

A Chicago man was robbed at gunpoint and shot three times in an upscale neighborhood early Friday morning, according to authorities.

The incident occurred on the 1300 block of West Webster Avenue in Lincoln Park around 3:05 a.m., the Chicago Police Department said.

A GoFundMe titled ""Lincoln Park Shooting Victim"" names the victim as Dakotah Earley, a 23-year-old culinary arts student.

""What happened to my brother was a senseless act of violence,"" Earley's brother, DaShawn Earley, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""He was shot and left to die over a bag and a cellphone. We have to stop treating peoples lives like they are nothing. He has a family who loves him and wants more than anything for him to pull through. We are praying he makes it and that we get justice for those who committed this heinous act.""

Officers responded to reports of a person shot and found Earley on the ground with two gunshot wounds to his back and one gunshot wound to his head upon arrival.

Video footage of the incident obtained by FOX 32 Chicago shows one suspect hiding behind a wall as Earley walks on the sidewalk in the direction of the suspect. The suspect then appears from behind the wall, approaches Earley and demands his property while holding him at gunpoint.

Earley appears to comply initially but then begins to fight back against the suspect. The pair eventually land in the street with the suspect on top of the victim. A second suspect eventually stands over both the first suspect and Earley.

The first suspect appears to fire twice at Earley, who remains on the ground, before demanding he give up his phone password, FOX 32 reported.

Earley can be heard saying something and moaning in pain before the suspect shoots him once more in the head.

Authorities transported the 23-year-old to Illinois Masonic Medical Center in critical condition.

668,"Ex-Ukraine prosecutor said he was told to back off probe of Biden-linked firm, files show",Brooke Singman,"

The fired prosecutor at the center of the Ukraine controversy said during a private interview with President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani earlier this year that he was told to back off an investigation involving a natural gas firm that was linked to Joe Biden’s son, according to details of that interview that were handed over to Congress by the State Department’s inspector general Wednesday.

Fox News obtained a copy of Giuliani’s notes from his January 2019 interview with fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in which he claimed that his “investigations stopped out of fear of the United States.”

“Mr. Shokin attempted to continue the investigations but on or around June or July of 2015, the U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey R. Pyatt told him that the investigation has to be handled with white gloves, which according to Mr. Shokin, that implied do nothing,” the notes from the interview stated. The notes also claimed Shokin was told Biden had held up U.S. aid to Ukraine over the investigation.

RENEWED INTEREST IN JOE BIDEN’S OFFICIAL TRIP TO CHINA IN 2013 WITH SON HUNTER

Shokin was fired in April 2016, and his case was “closed by the current Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko,” according to the notes. Despite his claims, Shokin, on both sides of the Atlantic, had been widely accused of corruption.

But Biden's role is back in the spotlight after Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry over Trump's efforts to convince Ukraine to look into Biden's actions.

Biden, who has been seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, once famously boasted on camera that when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin who was the top prosecutor at the time. He had been investigating the founder of Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a lucrative role on the board.

Allies of the Democrat, though, maintained that his intervention prompting the firing of Shokin had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to the corruption concerns. The Biden campaign has also slammed Giuliani and blasted media outlets for giving him air time. The campaign wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News and CNN to voice “grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump.”

“The substance of President Trump and Rudy Giuliani’s claims has been roundly discredited,” Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield said last week. “This is not a claim from the campaign or Joe Biden. This is an irrefutable fact.”

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that by the time of Biden's intervention, the Burisma probe had been dormant.

However, Shokin, at the time, according to the interview, was investigating Mykola Zlochevsky, the former minister of ecology and natural resources of Ukraine — also the founder of Burisma. Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of the firm, which Shokin claimed was an appointment made by Zlochevsky “in order to protect himself.”

The interview purportedly conducted by Giuliani took place on Jan. 23, 2019 at an office on Park Avenue in New York City. Shokin was interviewed over the phone, and interpreters were used — one in Ukraine and one in New York, according to the notes obtained by Fox News.

In a statement to Fox News after this report was first published, Giuliani said the details were gathered before Biden announced his presidential run and the allegations were brought to him.

""I explored them as part of my duty as an attorney to show that the crimes committed, were not by my client, but by Democrats. I was not seeking to investigate Joe Biden. I was not investigating Joe Biden,"" Giuliani said.

He also confirmed that he brought the documents to the State Department, saying that he was disappointed they had not been investigated.

""Maybe they will now,"" he said.

The new documents were shared with Fox News by sources familiar with the “urgent” briefing held by State Department Inspector General Steve Linick on Wednesday.

Linick gave a closed-door briefing on Ukraine to aides from the Senate committees on Intelligence, Foreign Relations, Appropriations and Homeland Security, as well as aides from the House committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, Appropriations and Oversight. The briefing lasted over an hour and took place in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) on Capitol Hill Wednesday afternoon.

Linick shared a file with those who attended the briefing, containing multiple folders with the Trump Hotel logo on them. Inside the folders were notes from an interview conducted by Giuliani in January 2019 with Shokin, as well as Lutsenko. Another folder contained news clips, as well as several timelines about investigations related to Burisma.

A State Department spokesman on Wednesday confirmed to Fox News that the “relevant” materials Linick shared with Congress “were provided by the Department to the Inspector General on May 3, 2019 for his review and for such action as the Inspector General deemed appropriate.”

HOUSE DEMOCRATS PREP WHITE HOUSE SUBPOENA, AS TRUMP CALLS BS ON IMPEACHMENT PUSH

Linick told aides in the meeting that he received the package of information in the spring but did not know the sender. Linick sent it to the FBI because it included allegations of improper activities in Ukraine that were outside of his jurisdiction, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Last week, though, Linick was given permission by the FBI to share the files with Congress and said they were relevant to the congressional interviews being conducted, according to sources.

The documents came amid the uproar surrounding Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he sought an investigation into Biden’s Ukraine dealings, as well as his son’s. That phone call sparked a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives and had the Trump administration facing a new round of subpoenas.

Amid the rapidly moving impeachment inquiry being led by House Democrats, the details included in the folder turned over by the State Department inspector general could be used by the Trump administration to fuel its claim that the real scandal surrounded the Bidens. However, Democrats already have cast the files as “debunked conspiracy theories” and “propaganda.”

""The briefing and documents raise troubling questions about apparent efforts inside and outside the Trump Administration to target specific officials, including former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Masha Yovanovitch, who was abruptly removed as Ambassador in May after a sustained campaign against her by the President’s agent, Rudy Giuliani,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in a statement late Wednesday.

“The documents provided by the inspector general included a package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations in an envelope marked ‘White House’ and containing folders labeled ‘Trump Hotel.’ These documents also reinforce concern that the president and his allies sought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the president’s personal political interests.”

Meanwhile, the sources also shared pages of the Shokin interview with Fox News which revealed that in February 2016, prior to his firing, there were warrants placed on the accounts of “multiple people in Ukraine.”

POMPEO HITS BACK AT HOUSE DEMS IN DEPOSITION STANDOFF, CONFIRMS HE WAS ON UKRAINE CALL

“There were requests for information on Hunter Biden to which nothing was received,” Shokin said, according to the notes. “It is believed that Hunter Biden receives a salary, commission plus one million dollars. There were no documents or information on Hunter Biden, and Mr. Shokin stated he was warned to stop by Ambassador Geoffrey R. Pyatt.”

The notes add that “President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko told Mr. Shokin not to investigate Burisma as it was not in the interest of Joe and/or Hunter Biden. Mr. Shokin was called into Mr. Poroshenko’s office and told that the investigation into Burisma and the Managing Director where Hunter Biden is on the board, has caused Joe Biden to hold up one billion dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine.”

Shokin then told Giuliani, according to the notes, that “in or around April of 2016” Poroshenko “told him he had to be fired as the aid to the Ukraine was being withheld by Joe Biden.”

Biden reportedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.

Shokin also claimed, according to the notes, that Ambassador Marie L. Yovanovitch denied him visa travel to the U.S., and claimed it was because “she is close to Mr. Biden.”

Meanwhile, Trump is facing a rapidly escalating House investigation after an intelligence community whistleblower filed a complaint regarding his call with Zelensky, claiming he had solicited a foreign power to help influence the 2020 presidential election.

Democrats have claimed that the Trump-Zelensky call revealed a quid pro quo, saying Trump tied his request to investigate the Bidens to military aid. Trump reportedly even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky, a detail that fueled impeachment calls. However, the call transcript did not show Trump explicitly mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip.

As part of the impeachment inquiry, House Democrats have subpoenaed Giuliani for key documents related to the Ukraine controversy. They also have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and are expected to receive depositions from nearly half a dozen State Department officials named in the whistleblower complaint.

672,Media watchdog hangs billboard outside New York Times office accusing paper of bias against Israel,Brian Flood,"

A pro-Israel media watchdog group has plastered an enormous billboard outside the headquarters of The New York Times that condemns the paper for alleged biased coverage against Israel.

The billboard, put up by The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), reads “The New York Times” in the paper’s signature font with the message, “At it again: Defaming Israel with distorted ‘news.’”

CAMERA bills itself as the world’s oldest and largest Middle East media-monitoring and educational organization. The group’s executive director Andrea Levin said in a statement that the sign “represents the collective voice of hundreds of thousands of people” who are frustrated at the paper’s “shoddy reporting and bias” against Israel.

“We're inundated with complaints about the New York Times, and for good reason,” Levin said.

The New York Times did not immediately respond to request for comment.

CAMERA also created a timeline of what it considers the Times’ “stumbles” when covering the Arab-Israeli conflict. The timeline features 18 examples of alleged bias against Israel since the CAMERA project began in December 2017. The group accuses the Times of everything from ignoring anti-Semitic rhetoric from Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to putting a spotlight on a decade-old recording of the Israeli prime minister's wife losing her temper during a phone call.

“Numerous examples of error-ridden articles at the Times have been documented by CAMERA analysts,” Levin said. ""There are years when the coverage seems more attentive to objectivity and balance and other times when opinion pours into the 'news' and editors allow this – and refuse to correct clear-cut factual errors. We seem to be back in one of those periods.""

CAMERA senior research analyst Gilead Ini said in a statement that he wants the paper to live up to its own standards of accuracy and accountability.

“The New York Times can and should provide excellent journalism, but unfortunately its coverage of Israel right now is often marred by errors, bias, and significant omissions. In the recent Gaza violence driven by Hamas, to mention just one instance, the Times termed the barrages of fire bombs, rocks and attempts to tear down the border fence an 'experiment with nonviolent protest,’” Ini said.

CAMERA also used a massive billboard to bring attention to what the group considers biased coverage of Israel by the Times back in 2013. The group said that the current version is in a high-traffic setting and will be seen by roughly 100,000 people per day.

The Department of Homeland Security has formed a new Disinformation Governance Board ahead of the 2022 midterms in order to counter online ""misinformation"" related to COVID-19, elections and migrant smuggling.

President Biden’s pick to head the board, Nina Jankowicz, has already ruffled some feathers after it was discovered that the Wilson Center global fellow and author had previously pushed information later found to be false or misleading.

In March 2020, Jankowicz quote-tweeted a post from Rob Leathern, who formerly worked on integrity products at Facebook. At the time Leathern announced that the company was giving the World Health Organization, and other notable groups, as many free ads as needed for COVID-19 response.

LIBERAL MEDIA, WATCHDOGS 'UTTERLY ASLEEP AT THEIR KEYBOARDS' ON BIDEN’S DISINFORMATION GOVERNANCE BOARD

""This is good. Now hope the rest of the adtech industry stops placing ads for mask and worse (straight up disinfo!) on articles and info about coronavirus,"" Jankowicz wrote on Twitter.

The new disinformation board executive director was likely touting the opinion of Dr. Anthony Fauci and other U.S. health leaders, who at the time advised Americans not to wear masks. Later, Fauci admitted he was concerned there wouldn’t be enough protective equipment (PPE) for frontline health care workers. Additionally, health experts initially claimed they did not fully know how contagious coronavirus was or how exactly it spread.

The disinformation fellow has also repeatedly called into question the legitimacy of the Hunter Biden laptop story.

""Back on the ‘laptop from hell,’ apparently—Biden notes 50 former natsec officials and 5 former CIA heads that believe the laptop is a Russian influence op. Trump says ‘Russia, Russia, Russia,’"" Jankowicz tweeted in October 2020.

After the tweet resurfaced and drew criticism from conservatives, Jankowicz cast doubt on the controversy by claiming it was ""simply a direct quote"" from the presidential candidates.

But, a week before her tweet about the debate, Jankowicz said the laptop should be viewed as a ""Trump campaign product"" during a conversation with the Associated Press.

Jankowicz also tweeted about the laptop on two other occasions. In one instance, she tweeted out a link to an article from TIME that she claimed indicated ""more doubt on the provenance"" of the New York Post story that initially broke the news on Biden’s son.

TWITTER USERS SHOCKED BY ‘RIDICULOUS’ TIKTOK OF NEW ‘DISINFORMATION CZAR’ SINGING: ‘GOD HELP US’

Another tweet saw the disinfo expert claim that the Hunter Biden emails need not be altered to be ""part of an influential campaign"" and argued voters ""deserve context"" rather than a ""fairy tale"" about the Delaware laptop repair store.

Additionally, Jankowicz also hyped up Chris Steele, the former British Spy whose fake dossier was used in part as the impetus for the investigation into whether Trump colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 presidential election. The dossier has since been discredited as dubiously sourced and full of innuendo, rumor, or information that was already publicly available.

""Listened to this last night – Chris Steele (yes THAT Chris Steele) provides some great historical context about the evolution of disinfo. Worth a listen,"" Jankowicz wrote in August 2020.

Outside of these comments Jankowicz has also posted a number of tweets that critics panned as controversial and bizarre. Users also pointed to tweets where the executive director made past predictions that turned out to be incorrect.

During Hillary Clinton’s campaign against Trump, Jankowicz posted this: ""Maybe @HillaryClinton's most important point so far: 'A @realDonaldTrumppresidency would embolden ISIS.' #ImWithHer.""

The Islamic State caliphate collapsed under the Trump administration, which also carried out the successful operation to kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

NEW DISINFORMATION GOVERNANCE BOARD BETTER SUITED FOR DICTATORSHIPS: GABBARD

During a recent conversation with NPR, Jankowicz discussed Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter where she voiced concern that ""free speech absolutists"" would have negative consequences for marginalized communities on social media platforms. She reiterated her point in an April 25 tweet.

""Last week I told @NPRMICHEL: I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities…which are already shouldering…disproportionate amounts of this abuse,"" she wrote.

Conservative critics also knocked the ""disinformation czar"" for claiming that ""free spirited"" Americans would not comply with social distancing recommendations ""unless they’re forced upon"" them.

""So force away! Lock us down. People are not taking this seriously,"" she wrote in part.

Another tweet from January saw Jankowicz come under fire for her claim that ""there are many non-binary people who give birth,"" and for using the term ""pregnant people"" rather than women.

Surprisingly, at one point, the disinformation leader appeared to be against the idea of the kind of government board she now spearheads. In a May 2020 interview, Jankowicz bashed the idea of the Trump administration having the ability to determine what is real news and ""fake news,"" and mentioned Poland’s ""Ministry of Digitalization"" as an example of ""fodder"" for ""anti-democratic online governance.""

""I would never want to see our executive branch have that sort of power,"" she noted.

Asked by Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich about prior statements made by Jankowicz and how the administration can ""assuage concerns"" over her appointment to lead the effort fairly, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded on Thursday, ""It sounds like the objective of the board is to prevent disinformation and misinformation from traveling around the country in a range of communities. I'm not sure who opposes that effort.""",https://www.foxnews.com
674,Tucker: Libs of TikTok oust campaign was designed to shut down a highly effective Twitter feed,Tucker Carlson,"

Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" Last year, unbeknownst to pretty much nobody, a woman in Brooklyn started a Twitter account that was comprised almost solely of videos of liberals talking about themselves. The concept was very simple: Find interesting tape that had already been uploaded to the internet by the people who made it and then repost that tape. There was no editing of it, no special effects. There was very little editorial content.

The idea was to let activist-types describe, in their own words, what they believe, unfiltered. The woman who created it called that account ""Libs of TikTok."" Libs of TikTok now has more followers than the entire population of the state of Wyoming. Libs of TikTok's audience dwarfs the nightly viewership on CNN.

So, it was quite successful by definition. The question is why?

Here's why: It turns out that is repellent as academic lifestyle liberalism may seem to you as an observer. The reality of it, as described by the people who actually believe this stuff, is even worse than you ever imagined. It's really beyond belief, both idiotic and disgusting. It's like watching someone eat roadkill. You feel nauseous, but you can't turn away. So, Libs of TikTok not only found all kinds of tape on the internet, but they found a bunch of selfie-style videos from the publicly available social media accounts of teachers. They didn't snoop. They just put what people already posted. Here's some of what they found:

WASHINGTON POST’S TAYLOR LORENZ DOXXES LIBS OF TIKTOK DAYS AFTER DECRYING ONLINE HARASSMENT OF WOMEN

TEACHER: Hi, my name is -- and I'm a preschool teacher. Recently, we started wearing pronoun pins and the kids get to pick a new pronoun pin every day. We have something that pick she/her every single day and we have some that change it up.

TEACHER: So, I'm a non-binary preschool teacher and my kids know I’m non-binary. They know I'm not a girl or a boy. I use they/them pronouns in the classroom. We work on it. Not all kids get it. That's OK and I go by Mx Gray in the classroom, not Miss or Mister.

TEACHER: Man, y'all thought me teaching the children about me being poly was crazy, but not only that, but they also know that I'm gender-fluid.

UKRAINIAN RUNNERS SHOW NATIONAL PRIDE AT BOSTON MARATHON

TEACHER: I'm going to give you my explanation about what it means to be transgender as well. So, when babies are born, the doctor looks at them, and they make a guess about whether the baby is a boy or a girl.

TEACHER: Kids as young as 3 and 4 are actually aware of their gender identity, even if they don't have the language for it. To say that pre-K through 3rd grade are not ready for such topics is actually internalized homophobia and transphobia.

So those are the people in charge of tending to your small children's minds while you're at work. Now maybe you agree with the views you just heard. Maybe you think that doctors just guess at the sex of newborns. Maybe you don't agree. It almost doesn't matter. Either way, you have a right as a parent to know what these people are teaching to your children. And yet, before Libs of TikTok, there was not an easy way to find out what they were teaching. You take the teacher's word for it.

Well, it turns out there are an awful lot of videos like this out there. Libs of TikTok found a lot of them. Here, for example, is the scene at one private school in Washington, D.C..:

KIDS CHANTING: Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter!

UKRAINE: GREECE’S MILITARY HAS SEIZED RUSSIAN OIL TANKER

OK, so let's say you're paying $45,000 a year to send your kids to some overrated, mediocre private school in the District of Columbia. You think everything's fine. You pull up Libs of TikTok and you find out what's actually happening in your kid's classroom. What's wrong with that? This is journalism. No news organization in America has done more to reveal the reality within American schools than Libs of TikTok.

We aired a number of their videos on the show, and we are grateful for their reporting. It was far more straightforward than anything you're going to find in The New York Times or The Washington Post, because it wasn't accompanied by a lot of bloviating. They just showed you the tape, and you can decide. That's journalism. Here's another piece of tape that Libs of TikTok unearthed that amazed and horrified us. This is a teacher screaming at a student for refusing to wear a mask:

STUDENT: Are you playing?

TEACHER: No, I'm not. Otherwise, I will call the police. I'm serious.

STUDENT: Are you serious?

BIDEN TELLS OBAMA HE’S RUNNING IN 2024: REPORT

TEACHER: Yeah, I am serious, man. I had enough of it. I knew you were going to take off your mask the moment I turned the corner. So enjoy BIA.

STUDENT: What's that?

TEACHER: That's the in-school suspension where you have to sit in the room with the military guy all day because you're a piece of s----.

""I'm going to call the police,"" he screeches, because the kid has the mask beneath his nose. Now again, maybe you're OK with your kids being taught by emotionally incontinent nutcases like that. Maybe you're not. But you probably ought to know either way.

So, you can see why Libs of TikTok quickly became so very popular. You didn't have to wade through some long editorial to find out what was actually happening. You could see the raw video and again, you could assess it for yourself. Millions of parents were grateful for that.

RUSSIA ACCUSES BIDEN OF HAVING DEMENTIA

So, is Christina Pushaw who is the press secretary for the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. It was partly in response to videos that she saw on Libs of TikTok that Florida ultimately banned public school teachers from lecturing kindergartners about sex. That's no lie. It's one of the most popular laws in the state. A majority of Democrats support it. So, Libs of TikTok was getting results as good journalism does. Not bad for a Twitter feed.

So, of course, that Twitter feed had to be shut down. The Biden administration and its many servants in the news media set off to work. The neoliberal slander machine Media Matters published four separate hit pieces on Libs of TikTok in just the past three weeks. It was trafficking hate for allowing liberals to talk about themselves. It was anti-gay as if the site was attacking anyone.

Certainly, it was not attacking gays. It was just playing tape of people talking about themselves in their own words—video that they uploaded.

Well, Twitter could not stand this. They shut down the account entirely twice. They suspended it. One of the suspensions came after a complaint from a Harvard law instructor called Alejandra Caraballo.

""My report on Libs of TikTok violating Twitter rules got them suspended,"" she bragged. Yet the woman who runs Libs of TikTok kept going.

BIDEN TO GIVE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH AT UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE NEXT MONTH

So ultimately, Jeff Bezos weighed in. Bezos' personal newspaper, The Washington Post, decided to harass the family of the woman who operates the Libs of TikTok. They couldn't find her, so they went after her family. The Post sent what it calls its tech columnist, Taylor Lorenz, to show up outside a home that belongs to one of the woman's relatives and then Lorenz set about trying to find the woman herself.

She couldn't. She sent a direct message on Twitter to someone who turned out to be not that woman and had nothing to do with the account whatsoever. But because she did that, we know what Taylor Lorenz was saying.

Here's what she said: ""You're being implicated in starting a hate campaign against LGBTQ people."" Right, a hate campaign. So here you have Taylor Lorenz, who's effectively acting as the Stasi for the Deep State, trying to intimidate a private citizen into silence and this morning she gave her best shot. The Washington Post published a piece by Lorenz linking to the name, the physical address and the real estate licensing information of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok.

After the Post published the article, the woman behind Libs of TikTok went into hiding. That was, of course, the whole point of the exercise. People know where she lives because The Washington Post linked to it, so she had to leave.

Now, Taylor Lorenz, of all people, knew this would happen. She knew what she was doing when she wrote the story. She was trying to shut this woman up. It was just a couple of months ago, you might remember, that Lorenz herself complained on television that she was being harassed and that no one under any circumstances would be allowed to show up at her home. Here she is:

COMMUNITY LEADERS DEMAND JAY CHEN APOLOGIZE FOR STEEL ACCENT COMMENTS AS RACE GETS HEATED

ALICIA MENENDEZ: Trolls live everywhere. Can you just explain was it's like? Can you draw a picture of what it is like when a surge of harassment hits?

TAYLOR LORENZ: It's horrifying and it's not just me either. You know, they immediately dox you and go after your family members. They try and look up everyone who's ever been associated with you, and it's just completely overwhelming and terrifying.

""Oh, they go after your family members!"" Could we put that picture back up? Can the control room do that? This is Taylor Lorenz outside the family members of the woman who run Libs of TikTok the other day harassing the family members. Now the tape you just saw comes from January. Then in April, just eight days ago, Taylor Lorenz, who cannot stop talking about herself, drowning in Lake Me, cried on television because she'd been criticized online. Watch:

BIDEN SAYS IT’S ‘UP TO’ TRAVELERS IF THEY WANT TO WEAR MASKS ON PLANES AFTER JUDGE BLOCKS MANDATE

TAYLOR LORENZ: I've had to remove every single social tie. I have severe PTSD from this. I contemplated suicide. It got really bad. You feel like any little piece of information that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your life and it's so isolating.

REPORTER: And terrifying.

TAYLOR LORENZ: It's horrifying. I'm so sorry.

REPORTER: No, you're fine. You're fine.

TAYLOR LORENZ: It's overwhelming. It's really hard.

WHITE HOUSE HOLDS CALL WITH ALLIES TO DISCUSS SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE

It's really hard to be from Greenwich and work for The Washington Post. It's hard. No power. But if you really think it's hard, if you're really against that kind of behavior, why are you engaging in it at scale?

So a few weeks later, after shooting that performance, Taylor Lorenz shows up at the door—and there's the picture right there – of a relative of the private citizen who posts videos that Taylor Lorenz's bosses don't like, and then she posts that person's identity online.

So this is obviously an intimidation campaign designed to shut down a highly effective Twitter feed. But take one step deeper into the story and ask yourself: Did Taylor Lorenz, the woman you just saw crying on TV because she has PTSD, did she really do the reporting here? Did she really track down the personal information of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Please, of course not. She couldn't.

Taylor Lorenz is not a reporter. Apart from whining about herself on television, she has no skills. She couldn't do a weather forecast in a rainstorm. She's not a journalist. She's merely a receptacle for information that other people gather for their own ends, a willing receptacle.

So where did she get this information? Who gave her the identity of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Well, actually, we don't have to guess because today's Washington Post story answers that question. The Post piece tells us that information came from a man called Travis Brown. Travis Brown runs the ""Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker,"" which uses a variety of proprietary methods to reveal personally identifying information of private citizens who stray from the approved storyline.

NEW GROUP THAT WORKS TO ELECT REPUBLICAN WOMEN GOVERNORS BRINGS IN $1 MILLION

Now, who pays for all this? That's the question. Well, the ""Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker"" is funded by something called the prototype fund. Here's how the prototype fund describes the point of Travis Brown's project: ""Prominent right-wing extremist accounts on Twitter and Facebook have developed a well-documented pattern to distribute controversial and extremist content to their followers and then delete it before moderators have the opportunity to react to it. In other words, before it can be censored. ""Archiving is an important element in counteracting this behavior and has in many cases led to prominent victories in the fight against the supreme extreme right.""

Extreme right? So, not all hate speech is the same. The hate speech tracker does not target the hate speech of BLM rioters or Antifa. No, only enemies of the Biden administration and the guys at Davos. How do they do it? Well, Brown's methods, according to him, include using automated software to save user account names and social media posts long after they have been deleted.

So, there's no hiding from these people. Now, that appears to be a violation of Twitter's terms of service. Not that we care because they don't care.

We reached out to Twitter about this. Isn't this a violation? Well, they ignored us. They suspended our account.

What's interesting, though, is that Travis Brown himself appears to be a former Twitter employee. So again, who's paying for this? Well, a foreign government is paying for it. The prototype fund gets its money not from private donors, but from the government of Germany—Germany's Federal Ministry of Education. It says so right on the website.

In other words, what happened to the woman who runs Libs of TikTok, her life being destroyed, was not the work of Taylor Lorenz, the fearless journalist who cries on TV from her PTSD. No, it was a foreign intelligence operation designed to silence and intimidate an American citizen. Wait, is that legal?

Did the Biden administration have any role in this particular intel op? Why is the German government trying to shut down an American Twitter account posting about American teachers? And since she was the recipient, the willing recipient, of this information from a foreign government designed to destroy an American citizen, why hasn't Taylor Lorenz, at the very least, registered under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA)?

We seem to remember quite a bit of talk about this over the last year. We think there was an impeachment trial of it. Someone went to prison because of it, but Taylor Lorenz can take information from a foreign government to crush an American citizen, clearly as part of an Intel operation, and she's a journalist in good standing at Jeff Bezos' newspaper? Lots of questions here. We hope we can get to the bottom of all of them.",https://www.foxnews.com
679,"First Texas bus drops off migrants blocks from US Capitol in Washington, DC",Ronn Blitzer,"

A bus from Texas arrived in Washington, D.C. Wednesday morning, transporting dozens of illegal immigrants as part of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s new plan to counter federal immigration policies during an ongoing border crisis.

Abbott announced last week that he was directing the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) to transport migrants released from federal custody in Texas to the nation’s capital and other locations outside his state.

TEXAS CLAIMS A WIN AFTER GOV. ABBOTT PLEDGED TO BUS ILLEGALS TO WASHINGTON

The bus pulled up at approximately 8 a.m. local time, blocks away from the U.S. Capitol building. Fox News has learned that they came from the Del Rio sector in Texas, after coming to the U.S. from Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

Upon the bus's arrival in Washington, D.C., individuals disembarked one by one except for family units who exited together. They checked in with officials and had wristbands they were wearing cut off before being told they could go.

According to TDEM, Abbott’s plan is already working. The agency told Fox News on Monday that many of the communities that originally reached out for support – from the Rio Grande Valley to Terrell County – say the federal government stopped dropping immigrants in their towns since Abbott's announcement on April 6.

Some had questioned whether Abbott’s plan to bus migrants was genuine. The White House dismissed it as a ""publicity stunt."" Even Texas state Rep. Matt Schaefer, a Republican, called it a ""gimmick.""

MIGRANTS SNAP SELFIES AT BORDER AFTER CROSSING INTO US

TDEM said it dispatched buses over the weekend to border communities where it coordinated with officials to identify these immigrants. The agency added that each bus has the capacity and supplies necessary to carry up to 40 migrants released in Texas communities and transport them to Washington, D.C.

Still, the governor's legal authority to transport busloads of migrants to the U.S. Capitol remains in question. The 2012 Supreme Court case, Arizona v. the United States, prevents states from making their own immigration policies.

Abbott insists that the federal government is failing to adequately address the situation. President Biden recently announced that he would be rescinding Title 42, which was used to expel migrants swiftly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Texans demand and deserve an aggressive, comprehensive strategy to secure our border—not President Biden's lackluster leadership,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""As the federal government continues to roll back commonsense policies that once kept our communities safe, our local law enforcement has stepped up to protect Texans from dangerous criminals, deadly drugs, and illegal contraband flooding into the Lone Star State.""

680,Trump signs memorandum diverting more water to California farmers,Andrew O'Reilly,"

President Trump on Wednesday signed a memorandum directing more of California’s scarce water supply to farmers and other agriculture interests in the state's Central Valley, a Republican stronghold.

Speaking alongside House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in the lawmaker’s hometown of Bakersfield, Trump boasted of how his administration reworked environmental rules to assure more water gets to farmers, while also taking shots at his political rivals – from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to Democratic presidential primary hopeful and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg.

“For too long water authorities have flushed millions of gallons into the Pacific,” Trump said. “I ordered the administration to update outdated opinions which determined water allocation in this state.”

Trump added that he is going “to put a lot of pressure” on Newsom to enact the changes and if the California governor doesn’t follow through then “you’ll get a new governor.”

TRUMP AND BLOOMBERG SPAR ON TWITTER AHEAD OF DEBATE

Trump has long criticized the environmental rules governing the flow of water in California – calling the rules “insane” during a campaign stop in 2016 and pledging that he’d be “opening up the water” for farmers.

The environmental rules are meant to ensure that enough water stayed in rivers and the San Francisco Bay to sustain more than a dozen endangered fish and other native species, which are struggling as agriculture and development diverts more water and land from wildlife.

Environmental advocates and the state say the changes will allow federal authorities to pump more water from California's wetter north southward to its biggest cities and farms.

The Trump administration, Republican lawmakers and farm and water agencies say the changes will allow for more flexibility in water deliveries. In California's heavily engineered water system, giant state and federal water projects made up of hundreds of miles of pipes, canals, pumps and dams, carry runoff from rain and Sierra Nevada snow melt from north to south — and serve as field of battle for lawsuits and regional political fights over competing demands for water.

Environmental groups say the changes will speed the disappearance of endangered winter-run salmon and other native fish and make life tougher for whales and other creatures in the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean.

After an initial study by federal scientists found the rule changes would harm salmon and whales, the Trump administration ordered a new round of review, California news organizations reported last year.

The overall effort “ensured the highest quality"" of evaluation of the rule changes, Paul Souza, Pacific Southwest director for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a statement Tuesday.

“We strongly disagree that the proposal will reduce protections for endangered species,"" Souza said.

Beyond operational changes in the federal Central Valley Project water system, the administration's changes allow for more habitat restoration, upgrades in fish hatcheries and the water system itself, monitoring of species and other improvements, Souza said.

Conservation groups have promised new rounds of lawsuits to try to block the redone environmental rules.

“The species really are in much worse shape” than in earlier years, Doug Obegi with the Natural Resources Defense Council said. “We are at the point where we may watch them wink out ... potentially in the next few years.”

681,NJ transgender woman who forced daughter into child porn operation sentenced with 3 others,Danielle Wallace,"

A transgender woman and biological father of a seven-year-old daughter has been sentenced along with three accomplices with forcing the young girl into child porn through a New Jersey production company.

Marina Volz, a 31-year-old transgender woman formerly known as Matthew Volz, traveled to the West Coast in December 2018 to assume custody of her biological daughter in Oregon and transported the now seven-year-old girl back to New Jersey ""with the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with the child,"" according to the Somerset County Acting Prosecutor’s Office.

Ashley Romero, a 28-year-old transgender woman once known as Adam Romero, and 54-year-old Sean Allen allegedly assisted Volz in bringing the child to New Jersey to be sexually assaulted and filmed.

NJ BOARD OF EDUCATION REFUSES TO REVIEW CONTROVERSIAL SEX EDUCATION CURRICULUM FOR YOUNG STUDENTS

The three operated what they described as a ""family-owned transgender pornography production studio specializing in amateur, BDSM and taboo fetish content"" out of a home located on Coburn Lane, in Franklin Township, New Jersey, according to the prosecutor’s office.

At the sentencing hearing Friday, Superior Court Judge Peter Tober declined to go into detail about the ""heinous, cruel and depraved"" nature of the crime besides disclosing the sex acts with the child involved collars, a cage in the basement, sex toys and other devices, My Central Jersey reported.

Once in New Jersey, Romero and Allen jointly sexually assaulted the child and filmed the assault, and police recovered video showing the act from multiple electronic items within the home. Investigators said further search of the electronic devices revealed multiple text messages and other communications between defendants Volz, Romero, Allen and third parties discussing the sexual assault of the child.

As part of her guilty plea, prosecutors said Volz admitted she brought her child to New Jersey with the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with her, and thereafter sexually assaulted her child both alone and jointly with defendant Romero and filmed the sexual assault.

Volz, Romero, Allen, along with a fourth defendant, 21-year-old Dulcinea Gnecco, described as the porn studio’s cook and bottle washer, were sentenced on Friday to a combined 67 years in prison stemming from their roles in the human trafficking and repeated sexual assault of the 7-year-old girl. Gnecco allegedly admitted to filming the girl while naked.

They all had pleaded guilty to various charges in November.

Assistant Somerset County Prosecutor Brian Stack described the foursome as a ""vortex of darkness"" who ""snuffed out"" the girl’s childhood by taking her from her mother and transporting her to New Jersey.

""They are incapable of redemption,"" Stack said. ""They're bad people.""

Volz and Romero each were sentenced to 25 years in New Jersey state prison without the possibility of sooner parole. Allen was sentenced to 12 years in state prison, with a ten-year period of parole ineligibility, and defendant Gnecco was sentenced to five years behind bars.

682,Pediatrician's plea to parents: Do NOT make your own baby formula,Corine Gatti-Santillo,"

Today's worrying shortage of baby formula across the country is not only throwing many parents of young children into a frenzy — it's bringing attention to the grave risks of using homemade baby formula as a replacement to feed infants.

In response to queries from Fox News Digital on the issue, Sarah Adams, M.D., FAAP, a pediatrician at Akron Children's Hospital in Akron, Ohio, acknowledged on Friday evening that ""parents in my practice are finding it hard to find baby formula,"" she said.

""The shortages [have been] exacerbated by the recall from [formula manufacturer] Abbott [Laboratories] — but it has gotten even worse since then,"" she said.

Said Dr. Adams, ""I have been told that due to the recall, [parents] were afraid to use the formula they had, even if it wasn’t one that was recalled.""

PARENTS SEARCH FRANTICALLY FOR HOMEMADE BABY FORMULA RECIPES

She added, ""And if they do find formula, they worry about the limits of how much formula they can buy at one time … They are calling our office and we are helping them by reaching out to local formula representatives.""

8 important recommendations for parents

Dr. Adams shared the following important advice and insights for parents, caregivers, grandparents and others with Fox News Digital on the topic of baby formula today for infants.

1. Avoid hoarding. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises buying no more than a 10-day to 2-week supply of formula.

KENTUCKY FAMILY REVEALS THEIR STRESSFUL SEARCH FOR BABY FORMULA

2. Call the doctor. ""Call your pediatrician’s office and ask if they can get you a can from the local formula representatives,"" she said.

3. Check with local charities. They might have supplies they can share.

4. Check with your local WIC office. This is the government program — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). It regularly supplies formula to lower-income families.

5. Check smaller stores and drug stores. These outlets may have supplies for purchase.

6. Buy formula online. Do make sure, however, urged Dr. Adams, ""to purchase from well-recognized distributors and pharmacies and NOT from individually sold [operations], auction sites or overseas!""

7. Make the switch. ""Switch to other formula brands or types of formula,"" she advised, ""but talk to your pediatrician first, especially if your baby must use a hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formula.""

""Always talk with your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby’s nutrition and feeding your baby.""

8. Check the shelf life of formula you do have. Make sure it is not on the recall list, advised Dr. Adams. ""Do not [throw away] any formula that has not expired or is not on the recall list,"" she said. ""Use concentrate or ready-to-feed [options], which may be more available.""

Do not panic

Dr. Adams, who is with Ohio's Pediatric Primary Care, Hudson, said it's important that parents not panic.

NORTH CAROLINA FOOD BANK DESCRIBES IMPACT OF BABY FORMULA OF SHORTAGE

""Always talk with your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby’s nutrition and feeding your baby,"" she said.

‘I do NOT recommend making your own formula’

Dr. Adams was quite clear on this point and all others: ""I do NOT recommend making your own formula,"" she said about reports that many parents are searching — both online and elsewhere — for homemade recipe alternatives.

""The AAP strongly advises against homemade formula,"" she said.

""These [options] are not safe and not FDA approved — infant deaths have been reported.""

Other key advice for parents and caregivers

Dr. Adams shared these critical insights as well.

Milk alternatives are not recommended for infants under a year of age.

Do not use almond or other plant-based milks — ""they are low in protein and minerals.""

Do not use toddler formula to feed infants.

Do not water down the formula — this practice ""is dangerous,"" she said, ""and can lead to poor nutritional balance and serious complications.""

Do not use formula sold overseas, as mentioned above.

BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE SPARKING PANIC AMONG PARENTS

All of this advice from Dr. Adams of Akron, Ohio, is in line with the input and advice Fox News Digital received this week from other pediatric professionals as well.

Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he will vote for Democrats if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court.

On Wednesday's installment of ""The Dave Portnoy Show,"" Portnoy asserted ""you can't get rid of Roe v. Wade,"" calling the end of protecting abortion on a federal level ""f---ed up.""

DAVE PORTNOY SAYS TRUMP WOULD BE WORSE THAN BIDEN IN A 2024 MATCHUP: HE'D BE ‘INTENTIONALLY’ DIVISIVE

""Some religious people be like, ‘Oh, baby,’ no, no, no. Ninety percent, anybody who's normally thinking, it's- If a woman wants to do it, it's her choice, her body, her choice, all that. To go backwards, it shows how f---ed up politics are,"" Portnoy said.

Portnoy told his co-host Eddie Farrer that the idea of overturning Roe v. Wade is ""so crazy"" he speculated ""it's a scam by the Democrats"" because they ""would win the White House no matter what"" in addition to turning the tide ahead of a grim midterm election.

""It doesn't matter- Republican, Democrat, you can't support this,"" Portnoy said. ""This is like going back in time. Like, what are we, in the 20s? It's so preposterous that I think the thing's made up, but you have to let women do that. It's a cause that, like, there's very few times I'll come out because you can't win with it. And it's certainly, certainly a controversial issue, but like I would walk in a rally for that. That is f---ing insane. It's so insane. I think it's almost made up and a ploy by the Democrats because they know how bad Biden's approval ratings are that it's like, ‘well, how do you swing it back the other way?’ … But if that thing is true, then that's a sad day in this country. That's all I'm gonna say about that. But it has to be said. There's certain issues you have to come out and be like, what are we f---ing talking about here?""

He continued, ""My brain is so f---ed up with how dirty politics are. I- it would be a brilliant tactic by the Democrats to be like, 'let's leak this' because Republicans will vote, I do believe, like me, I don't care- taxes, I don't care, nothing. If that is an issue. I vote Democrat.""

DAVE PORTNOY RIPS HOWARD STERN FOR VACCINE-SCOLDING JOE ROGAN: ‘HE’D BE WAGGING HIS FINGER AT A YOUNGER SELF'

The Barstool Sports icon called out Republicans for advocating for ""less government"" but aren't ""pro-choice"" on abortion.

""I know the argument. Yeah, you don't want the federal government making the laws, you want the state. But overall, the less government is just let a f---ing woman do what she wants with her body. Keep the government out of it. That's, to me, what that is. It's like, Yeah, you can't ban it. If a woman wants it great. She doesn't want it, great. Her choice… It's a crazy thing. It has to be said. People, I'm sure, some people like, 'That's not your thing.' They're gonna be mad. It's a super-sensitive issue. I don't care. Certain issues you have to be like, ‘What the f--- are you talking about?’ This is one of them,"" Portnoy added.

685,Former Alabama corrections officer Vicky White dies of self-inflicted injuries in Casey White manhunt,Michael Ruiz,"

Vicky White, the Alabama corrections officer who scandalized the country by allegedly walking a murder suspect and convicted felon out of the Lauderdale County Jail last month, has died. She was 56.

After spending 11 days on the run, traveling north from Florence, Alabama up to Evansville, Indiana, a U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force caught up with White and the convict, Casey Cole White, kicking off a high-speed chase that ended in a car wreck.

Facing arrest, she shot herself in the head, according to Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding, whose deputies assisted the Marshals in the chase. She was hospitalized in serious condition and succumbed to her wounds Monday evening.

""The Vanderburgh County Coroner's Office, the Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office and the U.S. Marshals Service are investigating the death of Vicky White, fugitive from Alabama,"" Vanderburgh Coroner Steve Lockyear said Monday evening.

She died just after 7 p.m. CT at Deaconess Hospital, he said. An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday.

CASEY WHITE PRISON ESCAPE: ALABAMA FUGITIVES IN CUSTODY, VICKY WHITE SUFFERS SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND

In the days leading up to the brazen escape, which jailhouse surveillance cameras recorded around 9:30 a.m. on the day Vicky White was supposed to retire, she sold her four-acre property for $95,000, and used a fake name to buy a getaway car. She withdrew tens of thousands of dollars from the bank and also picked up guns, men’s clothing and other supplies.

Then on the morning of April 29, she walked Casey White out of the jail, put him in her marked police vehicle and took off after claiming she was taking the inmate to the county courthouse for a mental health evaluation. To buy herself more time, she told colleagues she was going to see her doctor afterward because she felt ill.

Instead, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, she drove to a parking lot where she’d stashed a copper-colored, 2007 Ford Edge SUV, purchased in cash, to use as a getaway car.

CASEY WHITE ESCAPE: TIMELINE FOR ALABAMA MURDER SUSPECT ON THE RUN WITH CORRECTIONS OFFICER

White and White then traveled north, abandoning cars in Tennessee and Indiana.

Authorities found the Ford abandoned in Spring Hill, Tennessee. And on May 3, a car wash owner in Evansville, Indiana, reported a possible sighting

Surveillance images show a tall man, later identified as Casey White, at the self-serve car wash with a dark blue Ford F-150 pickup. Marshals recovered that vehicle Monday. Later that same day, they caught up with White and White, who by then were using a gray Cadillac.

""It’s hard to believe that they’ve been here that many days, but we were lucky that we stumbled upon them today,"" Sheriff Wedding said Monday.

CASEY WHITE ESCAPE: US MARSHALS INVESTIGATING SUSPECTED LINK TO ABANDONED VEHICLE IN EVANSVILLE, INDIANA

Vicky White had served as a corrections officer for nearly 17 years. She was a former employee of the year at the jail and for months had been telling colleagues she planned to retire to the beach. Despite a 1991 divorce, she remained close with her ex-husband until his death earlier this year.

Her involvement in a jailbreak shocked colleagues, who remembered her as diligent and dedicated to her job.

""Everybody thought she was gonna retire,"" Singleton said during a May 2 news briefing. ""Nobody saw this coming.""

On that day, authorities announced a warrant on charges she aided Casey White’s escape, even as the sheriff was still hopeful that her alleged assistance may have been coerced.

""To do it willingly would be so out of character for the Vicky White we all know,"" he said.

But ultimately, authorities would charge her with additional crimes before the Indiana car chase – fraud and forgery for allegedly using a fake name to buy the Ford SUV.

""He probably saw it as a sabbatical,"" said Seth Ferranti, a former federal fugitive and now an author and filmmaker. ""She had to have been in it for love.""

The recaptured fugitive was serving a 75-year sentence in connection with a violent crime spree that involved shooting at multiple individuals, wounding one and killing a dog, as well as convictions on kidnapping, attempted murder and carjacking charges.

While in prison for those crimes, investigators say he confessed to the 2015 murder of Connie Ridgeway, a 58-year-old woman stabbed to death in her own home.

""We hoped and prayed for the best possible outcome, and this isn't it,"" Ridgeway's son, Austin Williams, told Fox News Digital. ""Our hearts go out to Vicky White's family and friends.

The confession saw him transferred from state prison to the county jail for his arraignment in 2020. He returned to county custody earlier this year for the murder trial, which was slated to begin next month.

But behind the scenes, he and the facility’s former assistant director of corrections, Vicky White, had allegedly been in cahoots, involved in what Singleton described as a ""special relationship"" and ""jailhouse romance"" and maintaining contact over the phone for two years.

689,Garland says judges may consider criminal illegal immigrants' mental health when considering asylum claims,Adam Shaw,"

Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday said that immigration judges can now consider the mental health status of an illegal immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony when considering their asylum claim or whether to withhold their deportation -- overruling a prior decision by a top immigration appeals board.

The Immigration and Nationality Act makes illegal immigrants ineligible for both asylum and withholding of removal -- where illegal immigrants are not returned because they have a fear of persecution if returned to their country of origin -- if they have been convicted of a ""particularly serious crime"" that constitutes a danger to the community.

DOJ SILENT ON ABORTION PROTESTS AT JUSTICES' HOMES DESPITE FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITING ‘PICKETS’ TO INFLUENCE CASE

The DOJ’s Executive Office for Immigration Review’s Board of Immigration Appeals had previously ruled in 2014 (in a case known as ""Matter of G-G-S"") that, when judging that seriousness of the crime, ""a person’s mental health is not a factor to be considered in a particularly serious crime analysis"" given that judges are not to go beyond the decisions of the criminal judge, and that mental condition does not relate to the conviction and the facts that make them a danger to the community.

The case before Garland involved a Mexican national convicted in April 2017 of burglary in New Jersey and sentenced to four years in prison. He sought to block his deportation by claiming he would be persecuted because of his sexual orientation and a mental health condition if deported to Mexico.

The immigration judge dismissed the application because he did not consider the immigrant’s mental health. A subsequent appeal was also dismissed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Garland had in December directed the board to send him the case for review, and said on Monday that: ""I have determined that it is appropriate to overrule the Board’s decision in G-G-S.""

""In some circumstances, a respondent’s mental health condition may indicate that the respondent does not pose a danger to the community,"" he said, giving the example of a domestic violence victim who was convicted of assaulting their abuser, or that an assault was influenced by post-traumatic stress disorder.

SEN. KENNEDY GRILLS AG GARLAND ON CRIME, CALLS CHICAGO ‘WORLD'S LARGEST OUTDOOR SHOOTING RANGE'

""Of course, an individual may pose a danger to the community notwithstanding a mental health condition, and in those cases, the ‘particularly serious crime’ bar to asylum and withholding of removal may apply,"" he said.""But the potential relevance of mental health evidence to the dangerousness inquiry suffices to establish that such evidence should not categorically be disregarded, as G-G-S- held.""

Garland also vacated the Board’s decision in the case of the Mexican burglar.

""Going forward, immigration adjudicators may consider a respondent’s mental health in determining whether a respondent, ""having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States,"" he said.

The ruling comes as both the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security are moving forward with a final rule to streamline asylum claims by moving adjudication from immigration judges to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers.

690,Satanic Temple to argue abortion is ritual in legal challenges to states that put up hurdles to procedure,Bradford Betz,"

The Satanic Temple (TST) said its adherents should be permitted religious exceptions to perform religious abortion rituals in states that have put up barriers to the controversial procedure.

Responding to a leaked Supreme Court opinion draft that would overturn Roe v. Wade, TST said it was committed to protecting ""religious abortion access"" for its members.

""In states that outlaw abortion but grant exceptions for instances of incest and rape,"" TST said in a statement, ""members should be permitted a religious exception to perform TST’s religious abortion ritual.""

""States that outlaw abortion and do not grant exceptions present more significant challenges, but TST has a number of plans that we will be undertaking quite soon,"" TST said. ""First, we will be suing the FDA to permit TST access to Mifepristone and Misoprostol for use under medical supervision as part of our religious abortion ritual.""

TST said it is filing the lawsuit under Federal RFRA, adding that ""unfettered access"" to these drugs – which are taken to terminate a pregnancy – would be a considerable step toward enabling TST to perform its abortion ritual without government interference.

The religious organization introduced the ""Satanic Abortion Ritual"" to argue for a religious exception under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a 1993 federal law which made it illegal for states to interfere in anyone’s religion without demonstrating a compelling interest.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT HAS ‘NOT SEEN VIOLENCE’ AGAINST SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, AS PROTESTS ERUPT OUTSIDE HOMES

TST’s argument was that if it regarded abortion as a religious ritual, then the state could not legally intervene or burden patients with prerequisites. The ""ritual"" argument came amid a series of lawsuits aimed at Missouri where women are, among other things, compelled to read ""informed consent"" booklets before going through with an abortion.

One of their arguments was that subjecting its members to these requirements violated one of its central tenets: ""one’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.""

The abortion ritual, according to TST’s website, involves the recitation of two of its tenets and a personal affirmation that is ""ceremoniously intertwined"" with the abortion.

""Because prerequisite procedures such as waiting periods, mandatory viewing of sonograms, and compulsory counseling contravene Satanists’ religious convictions, those who perform the religious abortion ritual are exempt from these requirements and can receive first-trimester abortions on demand in states that enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,"" TST says on its website.

Fox News has reached out to TST for further comment and will update this story accordingly.

The leaked Supreme Court opinion draft that would overturn Roe v. Wade has ignited a firestorm across diverse faith communities.

Opponents of abortion view it as morally wrong, and in conservative Christian corners, the draft opinion has sparked hope.

691,California trans child molester Hannah Tubbs charged with first-degree murder,Audrey Conklin,"

Hannah Tubbs, a transgender California inmate convicted of molesting a child, has been charged with murder.

The first-degree murder charge out of Kern County on Tuesday comes after authorities recently charged Tubbs in connection to a 2019 robbery.

The suspect is being held on $1 million bond and is set to appear in court for an arraignment hearing on Tuesday afternoon, according to Kern County documents.

No further information about the murder charge was available as of Tuesday morning.

Tubbs became the center of controversy earlier this year after pleading guilty to a 2014 assault on a young girl inside a Denny's restaurant bathroom when the then-suspect was just weeks from turning 18. Prosecutors said Tubbs grabbed the girl by the throat, locked her in a stall, and put her hand down the girl’s pants.

CALIFORNIA TRANS CHILD MOLESTER, 26, GETS 2 YEARS IN JUVENILE FACILITY THANKS TO PROGRESSIVE DA GEORGE GASCON

Tubbs pleaded guilty to the attack last month, though the incident took place when Tubbs was two weeks shy of 18 and identified as a male named James Edward Tubbs. When authorities arrested Tubbs roughly eight years after the crime, the suspect, who has since been convicted of child molestation, began identifying as a woman, according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors sentenced Tubbs to two years at a juvenile facility because Gascon’s office declined to transfer the case to adult court, adhering to one of the progressive prosecutor’s day-one directives barring ""children"" from being tried as adults. The convicted criminal could, however, still serve as little as six months under California law and may not be required to register as a sex offender.

""Tubbs had a very lengthy criminal record before George Gascón allowed Tubbs to be sentenced to minimal time in a juvenile facility, which included arrests and convictions for murder, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, domestic violence and even a prior sexual assault of a 4-yr-old girl,"" Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami told Fox News Digital.

A spokesman for District Attorney George Gascon 's office previously told Fox News that Los Angeles officials will be notified if Tubbs is released from custody in Kern County.

CALIFORNIA TRANS CHILD MOLESTER HANNAH TUBBS GLOATS OVER LIGHT SENTENCE IN JAILHOUSE PHONE CALLS

""District Attorney George Gascón is committed to protecting the public and especially our children. In this case, Hannah Tubbs continues to serve her Los Angeles County sentence, while being prosecuted on an unrelated robbery charge in Kern County,"" Ricardo Santiago, a public information officer for the DAs office said. ""Her transfer was based on a 2019 warrant and approved by a court.""

The case has sparked criticism of District Attorney George Gascon 's directive that minor offenders suspected of committing serious crimes not be tried as adults as the DA faces a recall effort. Following the Tubbs sentence, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger called the outcome ""unsatisfactory.""

""Judge Barrera’s hands were tied today – due to the fact that the DA’s office failed to file a motion to transfer Tubbs to adult criminal court, which is where she rightly belongs,"" Barger said. ""Instead, we’re left with a 26-year-old individual sentenced to two years in a juvenile facility in isolation, separated by sight and sound from the other juveniles.""

Tubbs was later caught on a jailhouse phone call gloating about the case and bragging about not having to register as a sex offender.

""George shouldn’t have needed jail calls to convince him Tubbs was dangerous to our children. George has completely failed us all. He doesn’t deserve to be the LADA,"" Hatami said.

Tubbs was also accused of sexually molesting a 4-year-old girl at a California library in August 2013 while her mother was browsing books ""just a few aisles over.""

Anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List has endorsed Kathy Barnette in the GOP Senate race in Pennsylvania over former President Trump’s endorsement of Dr. Mehmet Oz.

""We are excited to endorse Kathy Barnette for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania,"" said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. ""Kathy is a courageous advocate for life who exposes the human cost of abortion. Her deeply compelling personal story ought to stir consciences across our nation, as she is proof that every child has dignity and deserves a chance and every mother deserves our support to choose life.""

SBA said political commentator Barnette will fight back against the ""radical Biden-Schumer agenda"" and stand up for the values of Pennsylvanians.

In their statement, the group highlighted Barnette’s background growing up in rural Alabama and praised her mother – who became pregnant with Barnette as a result of rape and ""courageously carried her pregnancy to term.""

Barnette worked in finance and served in the Armed Forces Reserves for a decade. She is the author of the book, ""Nothing to Lose, Everything to Gain: Being Black and Conservative in America.""

MCCORMICK SLAMS DR. OZ AS UNPOPULAR ‘HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL’ DAYS BEFORE PENNSYLVANIA GOP SENATE PRIMARY

Oz and Barnette gained significant ground as support for David McCormick dips, making it a tight three-way race in Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for U.S. Senate.

Trump formally endorsed Oz last month, saying ""he has lived with us through the screen and has always been very popular, respected, and smart.""

Abortion has become key to the primary debates after a leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion suggested the court’s conservative majority is poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.

In debates last week, Barnette and her opponent, former hedge fund CEO David McCormick, tried to paint Oz as insufficiently loyal to the anti-abortion cause because of comments on a 2019 radio show in which Oz said most people support the standard set in Roe v. Wade.

Barnette highlighted her background as being the product of rape when her mother was 11.

""I was not just a lump of cells,"" Barnette said. ""As you can see, I’m still not just a lump of cells.""

The Department of Justice's Inspector General's office announced Wednesday that one of its own employees leaked a draft report to the media that included non-public information.

The IG's office said that after they saw reporting about the leaked document, they referred the matter to the Integrity Committee of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency for investigation. While that committee declined to investigate because there were no allegations against anyone under their jurisdiction, they subsequently chose another Inspector General's office to hold an independent probe.

Fox News later learned following a Freedom of Information Act request that the investigation the employee had discussed with the media had to do with the Trump administration's ""Zero Tolerance"" border crossing policy which led to mass detentions and separations of families until then-President Donald Trump called for an end to the practice.

Articles based on the draft report were published in the New York Times and NBC News.

Because the ex-employee is a lawyer, the office that conducted the probe also submitted its report to the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility ""for appropriate action.""

Russia’s withdrawal of troops from a Ukrainian region that they encircled at the beginning of the war is proving their ""inability to capture key Ukrainian cities,"" the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense said Thursday.

In an intelligence update, the Ministry said ""Ukrainian forces are continuing to counterattack to the north of Kharkiv, recapturing several towns and villages towards the Russian border.""

""Despite Russia’s success in encircling Kharkiv in the initial stages of the conflict, it has reportedly withdrawn units from the region to reorganize and replenish its forces following heavy losses,"" the Ministry continued.

AMERICAN HELD HOSTAGE BY RUSSIAN FORCES SPEAKS OUT

Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s northeast, is the country’s second-largest city with an estimated population of nearly 1.5 million.

""The withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kharkiv Oblast is a tacit recognition of Russia’s inability to capture key Ukrainian cities where they expected limited resistance from the population,"" it added.

Medvedev, who now is the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, wrote in a Telegram post that such an escalation would be a ""catastrophic scenario for everyone.""

""The pumping of Ukraine by NATO countries with weapons, the training of its troops to use Western equipment, the dispatch of mercenaries and the conduct of exercises by the countries of the Alliance near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia instead of their ‘war by proxy,’"" he said.

The two suspects accused of kidnapping a 3-month-old baby boy from his grandmother's San Jose home last month had tried to abduct the infant on three previous occasions, prosecutors said Thursday.

Yesenia Ramirez, 43, and Jose Portillo, 28, were charged with additional kidnapping counts this week for those failed attempts.

Portillo allegedly went to the family's home while posing as a Child Protective Services worker about six weeks before the actual kidnapping. He demanded that the family hand over Brandon Cuellar, the 3-month-old infant, but they were suspicious and refused, according to the San Jose District Attorney's Office.

Ramirez, a friend of the baby's grandmother, was allegedly at the family's home when Portillo made this first attempt at abducting Brandon.

The suspects also allegedly tried to abduct the baby from a local Walmart on March 28 and on the morning of the actual kidnapping, but failed both times.

699,A Different Kind of Bloodbath,Amy Kellogg,"

Their digging up of dirt earned them the label ""undesirable organization."" This suggests they are exposing uncomfortable truths. It means their investigative team is now working in exile. Roman Badanin, editor of the journal ""Proekt"" has a contract at Stanford University for the year. There are worse places to find yourself stuck far from home. But Badanin can't go home, or he says, he'll get thrown in jail. Between obligations at Stanford and working on exposes about the Russian government, he says he is ""crowdfunding"" like crazy to keep his scattered team of reporters afloat.

""Proekt's latest investigation found that Russian President Putin is possibly quite sick--at least quite concerned about his health and perhaps pre-occupied with aging. A detail from the report that jumps out is that a thyroid cancer specialist allegedly made 35 trips to see the Russian president, spending 166 days with him, over a recent four-year period. And this doctor is not the only one traveling to Putin's retreats away from the Kremlin and during periods when he has mysteriously been out of public view for relatively lengthy periods.

WHY GEN. MILLEY'S UKRAINE WAR PREDICTION MISSED BY A MILE

""Russian propaganda creates the image of a 100 percent healthy sport-addicted president. And all of a sudden we discovered that he's literally encircled by doctors,"" Roman Badanin told Fox News. ""In total, we have 60 doctors who traveled with him on different occasions every time, for example, when he travels to Sochi (Putin's preferred Black Sea resort) they travel. On the same route, on the same dates. So again, after the investigation was published, we received some, of course unofficial, confirmation that at least we were right in saying that Putin is really worried about his health."" Badanin and colleagues went about their investigation by finding contracts of these doctors who are affiliated with a public hospital and matching some of their travels to those of Putin--for example, when he went to his Sochi retreat. The contracts would show these doctors to be staying in a hotel near Putin's place. Rather surprisingly the paper trail is public. Tracking movement this way had them employing a similar technique to what opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the Bellingcat investigative unit used to track down Navalny's stalkers and poisoners.

Among the other doctors apparently in the president's orbit--an expert in resuscitation, someone who has reportedly penned a manual about dealing with acute illnesses, injuries and poisonings, and also neurologists. Badanin says the thyroid cancer specialist's alleged relationship with Putin does not necessarily mean the president has cancer, or that cancer. The only thing certain is that the particular doctor, Yevgeny Selivanov, got his PhD in thyroid cancer according to Badanin. He may focus on other areas now. There have long been rumors about Putin's health. Each time he disappears from sight, tongues wag. His suddenly smooth faced appearance sparked speculation about botox use some years back. Recent puffiness, some say, suggests he is on heavy medication and that has led to all sorts of theories about what could be ailing him.

HALEY WELCOMES RUSSIA'S OUSTING FROM UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL; SAYS VENEZUELA, CUBA, CHINA SHOULD BE NEXT

Another angle of the ""Proekt"" story is Putin's supposed fascination with alternative medicine. ""Sometime during his second term, Putin decided to live forever and to rule forever, because one day he realized that his health is the priority number one. Among other things, he tried untraditional medicine,"" Badanin said. ""We found that he was really interested in so-called blood baths done in the Altai region. They take baths with the boiled blood of the deer actually. And we know for sure Putin at least once tried these baths."" Badanin said he spoke to someone who did the same treatment on the same day. And he explained the blood is drained from the young, soft, sprouting antlers of deer.

There have clearly been a few sport injuries along the way and Badanin says Putin suffers from back problems as a result. But the Kremlin will attest to the Russian President's good health. And will no doubt dismiss the deer blood baths as the fakest of fake news. It is hard to imagine someone who sits so far away from visitors at his now famous long table plunking himself in a tub of animal blood. But Badanin insists he's got the scoop on good sourcing and apparently much of the Russian elite, starting with the Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu, have taken the plunge.

Badanin does admit that in the context of the past, Putin on the eve of turning 70, has outdone those who came before him. ""He's way healthier than all the predecessors of him, including Yeltsin, who resigned at the same age, or Brezhnev, who was almost ousted at the same age, and Andropov even died when he was 70,"" Badanin says. ""But again, he's ruling for 23 years. I believe that this time affected him a lot. It's not an easy task to run such a huge country for 23 years. And of course, I believe he has a lot of psychological and health issues.""",https://www.foxnews.com

Houston authorities say a security guard and possibly others were jabbed with syringes during Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival, which saw at least eight people killed and numerous others injured while the rapper was onstage Friday night.

At a news conference Saturday afternoon, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner confirmed that while the age of one fatality remained unknown, other victims were 14, 16, 21, 21, 23, 23 and 27. The causes of the deaths were not immediately known.

ASTROWORLD DEATHS: TRAVIS SCOTT 'ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED'

Turner confirmed that 25 other people were hospitalized, including several attendees under age 18.

Houston police Chief Troy Finner said his department had 528 officers on the scene with another 755 security officers provided by event promoter Live Nation.

He said there were ""a lot of narratives"" floating around regarding what happened at the event, but encouraged those keeping up with the case to ""follow the facts and evidence.""

He did say, however, that authorities have obtained a statement from a security guard suggesting the guard felt a prick in his neck and medical staff concurred that a marking on his skin aligned with such an event.

""There were some individuals that were trampled and we want to be respectful to that, we just ask that y'all give us time to do a proper investigation,"" he added, noting Live Nation has been cooperative and will provide video from the event to authorities on Saturday evening.

TRAVIS SCOTT'S ASTROWORLD: CROWD CHANTED 'STOP THE SHOW' AS CHAOS BROKE OUT

""This is now a criminal investigation that's going to involve our homicide division as well as narcotics,"" he stated. ""And we're going to get to the bottom of it.""

Twenty-five arrests were made Friday, authorities said. Twenty-three were for trespassing, one was for public intoxication and one was for possession of marijuana.

Narcan was administered to several individuals – including the security guard who felt a prick in his neck – though the exact number of those treated was unclear.

Houston fire Chief Samuel Peña then spoke, explaining that his team would be ""looking into the permits that were issued and ensuring that the plan that was submitted was adhered to during the event.""

ASTROWORLD ORGANIZER LIVE NATION COOPERATING WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS, SAYS 'OUR HEARTS ARE WITH' VICTIMS

Peña praised his team's ""robust"" and ""incredible response"" to the incident and explained that ""there is no occupancy permit for an outdoor event,"" meaning that the number of attendees was not mandated by laws or regulations.

He said that more than 200,000 people could have gathered in the area, but that the outdoor venue limited attendance to 50,000 at the time of the festival.

""These injuries did not occur as people were trying to exit the venue,"" he stated, touting that doors remained open in accordance with the plan put in place for the event.

""What we're looking into is what caused the crowd surge, what led to the crowd surge,"" Peña said. He added that inspectors were on-site to oversee pyrotechnics, tents and doors.

When taking questions from the reporters that gathered for the conference, Finner was pressed on the timeline he provided for the evening – he had stated that at 9:30 p.m. they were alerted to people ""going down"" and that the event was wrapped up by 10:10 p.m.

INSIDE KYLIE JENNER, TRAVIS SCOTT'S 'INCREDIBLY CLOSE' RELATIONSHIP: SOURCE

One reporter asked for the reason for the 40-minute delay, which he attributed to the size and age of the crowd, stating they had to be careful not to incite a riot. When another journalist who claimed to be present at the concert claimed that his timeline was off, Finner allowed that if he was incorrect, he was only off by a minute or two.

He also confirmed that a 10-year-old was currently in critical condition, though offered no additional details.

Autopsies and toxicology reports were currently being conducted on the deceased.

According to a local news outlet, one of the victims was a freshman at Memorial High School in Houston.

Scott, 29, released a statement earlier Saturday, noting that he was ""absolutely devastated"" by the disaster.

A source told the New York Post's Page Six that the musician was ""in tears"" after he learned what was happening.

701,Kathy Barnette faces questions about her background amid scrutiny from conservative outlets,Joseph Wulfsohn,"

Kathy Barnette has seen a dramatic surge in recent polls in the U.S. Senate primary in Pennsylvania that was previously seen as a two-man race, but the Republican underdog is now facing new scrutiny about her background.

In the latest Fox News poll released this week, Barnette jumped ten points since March, just one point behind Dave McCormick and three points behind the Trump-backed Dr. Mehmet Oz.

Now on the cusp of potentially pulling a major upset in the multimillion-dollar primary, two reports published by the Washington Examiner and the Washington Free Beacon, allege the Barnette campaign has not been forthcoming with their inquiries, particularly pertaining to her military career.

FOX NEWS POLL: THREE-WAY RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA GOP SENATE PRIMARY ELECTION

According to her biography on her campaign website bio, Barnette ""served her country proudly for ten years in the Armed Forces Reserves, where she was accepted into Officer Candidacy School."" Campaign ads also feature her in uniform.

Additionally, Barnette's bio touts she was ""the first in her family to graduate from college achieving a bachelor in Finance and eventually earning her Master’s degree"" and worked in corporate America in the comptroller’s department at J.C.Penney"" and ""as an adjunct professor of Corporate Finance.""

However, a reporter from Free Beacon alleged Barnette's campaign manager abruptly ended a phone call when he requested her DD214, a routine military form filled out when one leaves active duty which would reveal her time of service, which branch she served and information about her discharge.

""While there is no indication that Barnette has mischaracterized her service, it is standard practice for a campaign to substantiate a candidate's claims with such government documents,"" Free Beacon reporter Chuck Ross wrote on Wednesday. ""Barnette's campaign manager, Bob Gillies, ended a phone call with the Washington Free Beacon on Wednesday when asked whether she will release her DD form and did not respond to subsequent text messages requesting it.""

A separate report released by the Washington Examiner alleged the Barnette campaign similarly avoided questions about her background.

KATHY BARNETTE SOARS IN PA ELECTION POLLS, GRABS MAJOR OUTSIDE SUPPORT IN GOP SENATE PRIMARY

""A series of questions asked both verbally and in a text exchange with her campaign manager about her background for a story that was supposed to be a profile went unanswered with the exception of one — but that too was vague,"" Examiner reporter Salena Zito wrote. ""When asked about her military service, the answer was: ‘Kathy noted basic training was Fort Dix, Army Reserves.’""

Zito listed the inquiries she had sent to the Barnette campaign, which were to name her hometown, where and when she worked as an adjunct professor, when she was in officer candidate school, which financial institutions she worked for, when she moved from Virginia to Pennsylvania- noting her book bio says from 2018 she lived in Virginia, and to confirm whether Troy State University was the college she attended.

Her campaign manager replied, ""Kathy keeps her early life as private as possible as I am sure you can understand why,"" alluding to her life story about how she was a child of rape.

""She could be hiding nothing. She could be hiding everything. We don’t know because there are no answers,"" Zito noted. ""While people hold a strong distaste for the press, many level-headed conservatives who really want to win this seat in November want to know as much as they can about each candidate.""

""While voters may have been turned off by the battle for the primary between Oz and McCormick, the truth is both of these men have faced incredible scrutiny by both the press and their opposing campaigns… Barnette has benefited from several things: little scrutiny and the rock-em-sock-em nature of the battle between Oz and McCormick that has been escalated by the proxy war between Trump and the Club for Growth,"" Zito added.

TRUMP TAKES AIM AT BARNETTE AFTER ONE-TIME LONGSHOT SOARS IN PENNSYLVANIA GOP PRIMARY

As both reports began going viral on Wednesday, Barnette released her NGB-22 form which documents her seven years, seven months and 12 days in the Army National Guard and that she received an honorable discharge, though it is different from the DD214 that was previously requested by the Free Beacon and the Examiner.

On Thursday, Barnette appeared on Philadelphia's Talk Radio 1210 WPHT program ""The Rich Zeoli Show"" where she was confronted with the looming questions.

Barnette said she ""started"" in the Army for three years before joining the Army National Guard and then ""finished"" in the Army, insisting her record in the military is public knowledge and that the National Guard ""does not have DD214.""

Zeoli then pulled up the list of questions Zito asked Barnette's campaign to have the candidate answer them herself, though she took a swipe at Zito alleging her report was published ""minutes"" after she sent her questions to the campaign.

Barnette told Zeoli her hometown was Nichburg, Alabama, which she said is now called Repton. When asked where and when she was an adjunct professor, Barnette said Judson University in Illinois but told Zeoli she doesn't remember the time frame. Regarding the financial institutions she worked for, Barnette replied A.G. Edwards and Sons and Bank of America Capital Asset Management, which were both listed on her campaign website bio. She also confirmed she graduated from Troy State University.

""Again,"" Zeoli said, ""don't get mad at me for asking-""

""I'm not!"" Barnette replied before laughing. ""These are relevant questions. I know, right? It's as if I'm hiding something!""

When asked when she moved from Virginia to Pennsylvania as alleged in her book, Barnette told Zeoli she never lived in Virginia and what was in her book was a ""typo"" discovered after the book was printed but added that she's been living in Pennsylvania for over nine years.

Zeoli then asked her whether she had a DD214 to release. Barnette says she had one pertaining to her ""first three years"" and pointed to the release of her NGB-22, but did not directly respond to the radio host's question.

Before the interview ended, Barnette told Zeoli that ""the people of Pennsylvania have vetted me"" over the course of her 13-month campaign, and they have said ""this is our candidate.""

""This is your chance best… I am your best chance at ever getting anyone in office who will actually listen to you,"" Barnette told Pennsylvania voters.

The Barnette campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News' multiple requests for comment.",https://www.foxnews.com
702,Family of 3-year-old abused by Food Network contestant Ariel Robinson speaks out after guilty verdict,Audrey Conklin,"

The family of a 3-year-old girl abused to death by her foster parents is grateful after a Greenville, South Carolina , jury found suspect Ariel Robinson, a former contestant on Food Network's ""Worst Cooks in America,"" guilty of homicide by child abuse.

Judge Letitia Verdin sentenced Robinson to life in prison for the January 2021 death of Victoria ""Tori"" Rose Smith following the jury's verdict after a four-day-long trial.

""It is a huge sense of relief that Victoria did get justice in the end. Obviously, we're still devastated that she's gone, but we are very grateful that the police and the prosecution and the judge…did such a wonderful job, and they did such a wonderful job that the jury could plainly see that she had committed this crime, and she's going to serve her life sentence for it,"" Michelle Wooten Urps, Smith's great aunt, told Fox News Digital of her family's reaction to the verdict.

Robinson, 30, and her 35-year-old husband, Jerry ""Austin"" Robinson, were arrested and charged with homicide by child abuse in January 2021 following Smith's death, Greenville County records show. Austin pleaded guilty last month to aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse and will serve between 10 and 20 years in prison, as FOX Carolina reported.

FOOD NETWORK CONTESTANT ARIEL ROBINSON SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR FOSTER DAUGHTER'S DEATH

The jury deliberated for about an hour and a half before reaching a verdict following a four-day trial. Robinson was sentenced to life in prison, according to the outlet.

""Her testimony honestly left me with a lot of confusion,"" Wooten Urps said of Robinson's remarks on the witness stand Thursday. ""She was obviously trying to deflect the blame. … She never actually placed the blame on anyone. She said it without saying it.""

Robinson had testified that Smith's brother, who was 7 at the time of Smith's death and whom the Robinsons were also fostering, would get angry with his younger sister and could have contributed to her killing, but evidence presented in court pointed to Ariel and Austin as the primary abusers in the household, according to FOX Carolina.

Christy Kednocker Sustakovitch, assistant solicitor for the Greenville County Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, said the prosecution is ""extremely grateful to the jury for their close attention and work on this devastating case.""

FOOD NETWORK CONTESTANT ACCUSED OF KILLING FOSTER DAUGHTER SAYS SHE WILL TAKE THE STAND IN TRIAL: REPORT

""This jury had to see and hear things that were truly horrific. We are very thankful for the verdict in this tragic case,"" she said. ""There are no winners in a case like this one. We can’t bring Tori back but she will always live on in our memories. I’ve learned in these cases, the best you can hope for is justice and the jury brought exactly that. May sweet Victoria Rose Smith rest in eternal peace forever.""

Wooten Urps and Smith's other relatives have been promoting a petition on Change.org with nearly 46,000 signatures that calls on South Carolina lawmakers to pass a foster-care reform bill called Victoria's Law. The law would reform the screening process for individuals interested in fostering and require the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) to perform random check-ins on foster homes.

Once Smith's mother's custodial rights were terminated, the 3-year-old's extended family made a request to the Robinsons to keep Smith's family ""updated"" about the children with the possibility of future contact, but the Robinsons ""declined"" that request, Wooten Urps explained.

FOOD NETWORK'S 'WORST COOKS IN AMERICA' SEASON CUT AFTER WINNER CHARGED WITH CHILD MURDER

""They said that they just needed time to bond and get used to each other as a family, and we respected and appreciated that at the time,"" she explained.

A representative from the South Carolina DSS testified during Ariel's trial that the department made regular, monthly visits to the Robinson household, but Wooten Urps does not believe that to be true.

""Honestly and truly, [the Smiths] should have never been placed in that home. The financial issues alone should have negated them from being able to get these kids. So…we're calling for more stringent screening processes,"" Wooten Urps said, adding that the fact that the Robinsons were not trained in CPR was a red flag.

BLACK LIVES MATTER SUPPORTER TWEETED ABOUT CHILDREN'S WHITE PRIVILEGE PRIOR TO ALLEGED CHILD MURDER

She continued: ""We're also asking for surprise visits. What's going to have to happen is…the DSS is responsible for all of this, and some of these responsibilities are going to have to be taken out of their system because their workload is just insane. They're just overworked and under-trained. There are plenty of other resources.""

Prosecutors earlier this week argued that the Robinsons fatally beat Smith on Jan. 14, 2021, when police found the girl unresponsive in their home. Greenville County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Ward, a forensic pathologist, testified on Wednesday that the toddler was beaten with such force that her blood vessels burst, allowing blood to collect in her muscles and fat, which could have led to her death, FOX Carolina reported.

""If we lose enough blood, the heart doesn’t have enough volume to pump,"" he said.

705,Biden's new 'ultra-MAGA' label came after six months of liberal-funded focus group research: Report,Joseph Wulfsohn,"

President Biden's new line of attack on Republicans was apparently the result of liberal-funded research.

Over the past week, Biden has repeatedly referred to his political adversaries as ""ultra-MAGA,"" referring to former President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" 2016 slogan.

The label has quickly been embraced by the right from lawmakers to the former president himself.

But according to The Washington Post, the ""ultra-MAGA"" messaging came from a six-month research project from the liberal group Center for American Progress Action Fund and headed by top Biden aide Anita Dunn.

JOURNALISTS SKEPTICAL OF BIDEN'S ‘ULTRA-MAGA’ LABEL FOR GOP, SPARKS COMPARISON TO ‘PUTIN’S PRICE HIKE'

The polling and focus group research by Hart Research and the Global Strategy Group found that ‘MAGA’ was already viewed negatively by voters — more negatively than other phrases like ‘Trump Republicans,’"" the Post reported Friday.

""In battleground areas, more than twice as many voters said they would be less likely to vote for someone called a 'MAGA Republican' than would be more likely. The research also found that the description tapped into the broad agreement among voters that the Republican Party had become more extreme and power-hungry in recent years.""

CAP Action Fund president and executive director Navin Nayak told the Post, ""All of that extremism gets captured in that brand,"" adding the ""versatile epithet"" applies to every political issue including abortion and climate change.

""We are not trying to create a new word. This is how they define themselves,"" Nayak said.

Critics mocked the research that went into Democrats' branding efforts on social media.

""'Ultra Make America Great Again' is supposed to help… Democrats?"" Washington Examiner reporter Jerry Dunleavy asked. ""Anyway, congrats to the consultants who were able to cash checks for this.""

""Psaki said yesterday Biden came up with this all by himself though,"" radio host Dana Loesch pointed out, referring to comments outgoing White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said asserting the ""ultra-MAGA"" talking point was a Biden original.

RICK SCOTT SAYS BIDEN IS ‘UNWELL’ AND SHOULD RESIGN, AS PRESIDENT HAMMERS ‘ULTRA-MAGA’ AGENDA

""What is wrong with the Democratic establishment? They think every problem can be fixed by spending money on consultants and better messaging, while completely resisting substantive changes,"" RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway reacted.

""If this took Biden 6 months it’s no surprise the Afghanistan withdrawal went as it did,"" Free Beacon writer Drew Holden quipped.

""Maybe it would have been better if Democrats had instead spent those six months preventing American children from going hungry because we are out of formula,"" former Trump aide Stephen Miller tweeted.

Last week, Biden debuted the term while attacking conservatives broadly following the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion that signaled the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

""This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history, in recent American history,"" Biden said to reporters on Wednesday, declaring a policy proposal released by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the ""ultra-MAGA agenda.""

Biden renewed the ""ultra-MAGA"" messaging on Tuesday during remarks about the soaring inflation.

BIDEN TO OUTLINE ‘PLAN TO TACKLE INFLATION,’ DRAW CONTRAST BETWEEN HIS ADMINISTRATION AND ‘ULTRA-MAGA’ PLANS

""Look, the bottom line is this- Americans have a choice right now, between two paths, reflecting two very different sets of values,"" Biden said.

""My plan attacks inflation and grows the economy by lowering costs for working families, giving workers well deserved raises, reducing the deficit by historic levels and making big corporations and the very wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. The other path is the ultra-MAGA plan put forward by congressional Republicans to raise taxes on working families, lower the income of America workers, threaten sacred programs Americans count on like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give break after break to big corporations and billionaires just like they did the last time they were in power.""

He also used the focus group lingo at a big-money Democratic fundraiser in Chicago.

The White House was quickly on board with the president's new messaging with Psaki declaring it ""the president’s phrase,"" with Biden giving MAGA ""a little extra pop.""

Psaki told reporters, ""Whether it's tomorrow or in days and weeks ahead… you will all continue to hear him talk more about his concern about ultra-MAGA Republicans and their agenda.""

Journalists were immediately skeptical by the new slogan, some even comparing to the Biden administration's ""Putin's Price Hike"" messaging attempting to blame soaring inflation and gas prices on Russia's invasion of Ukraine despite how both were surging months before the conflict began.

706,"Mayorkas won't name 1 domestic terror, White supremacy case referred to DOJ",Timothy Nerozzi,"

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Thursday failed to name a case of domestic terrorism that his department has referred to the Department of Justice.

Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., pressed Mayorkas for data on any referrals he has made to the DOJ on the grounds of domestic terrorism. Mayorkas did not offer the data, saying he would provide it after the hearing.

""Congressman, I will provide you with that information subsequent to this hearing,"" Mayorkas replied to Steube. ""I do not have that statistic. I will provide the data to you.""

The pair continued to clash on the subject, with Steube interrupting Mayorkas to demand he name one such case off the top of his head. Mayorkas continued to decline to answer.

""Despite claiming domestic terrorism is the #1 threat to the homeland, [Secretary Mayorkas] can’t name a single case that he referred from DHS to DOJ for white supremacy or domestic terrorism,"" Rep. Greg Steube later said of his exchange with Mayorkas.

707,Federal judge expected to rule on Title 42 lawsuit within days as border crisis rolls on,Adam Shaw,"

A federal judge is expected to determine the fate of the Biden administration’s plan to lift Title 42 within days in response to a lawsuit brought by two dozen Republican states that claims lifting the public health order will lead to a bigger crisis at the southern border.

Judge Robert Summerhays of the Western District of Louisiana heard arguments Friday about the request for a preliminary injunction on the Biden administration’s plan to end Title 42 May 23.

The public health order, enacted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been used by both the Trump and Biden administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the southern border.

FEDERAL JUDGE EXTENDS ORDER BLOCKING BIDEN ADMIN FROM ROLLING BACK TITLE 42 AHEAD OF HEARING

Republicans and some Democrats have warned that the already massive numbers of migrants being encountered at the border could surge if the order is lifted. It will also lead to significantly more migrants being released into the country, they say. The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged this possibility, saying it is preparing for up to 18,000 migrants a day once the order drops.

States led by Arizona, Missouri and Louisiana sued, claiming the move by the Centers for Disease Control to lift the order violated the Administrative Procedures Act, which requires a notice-and-comment period and also bars moves deemed ""arbitrary and capricious.""

The lawsuit claims the administration failed to estimate or account for the costs to the states. They cite ""increased health care costs for aliens infected with COVID-19 and the cost of increased illegal immigration caused by the Termination Order and the presence of much greater numbers of paroled aliens with non-meritorious asylum claims who were induced to enter the United States because of the Termination Order.""

""This suit challenges an imminent, man-made, self-inflicted calamity: the abrupt elimination of the only safety valve preventing this administration’s disastrous border policies from devolving into an unmitigated catastrophe,"" the complaint states.

REPUBLICAN STATES SUE TO STOP BIDEN ADMIN'S LIFTING OF TITLE 42 BORDER POLICY

The states are seeking a preliminary injunction but have already won smaller victories in a related push for a temporary restraining order to stop the Biden administration from transitioning away from Title 42 expulsions and instead using expedited removal as the May 23 date approaches.

Summerhays granted the temporary restraining order last month and extended it earlier this week.

Attorneys for the Justice Department argued Friday that the CDC was within its authority to lift an emergency health restriction it felt was no longer warranted at this stage of the pandemic, reiterating that Title 42 is a health policy, not an immigration measure.

""There is no basis to use Title 42 as a safety valve,"" the DOJ's Jean Lin told Summerhays.

Activists on both the right and the left believe that Summerhays, a Trump nominee, is likely to rule in favor of the Republicans who sued, meaning Title 42 will remain in place as the busy summer months at the border arrive.

There were 221,000-plus migrant encounters in March, and that number is expected to have risen in April. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has not yet released figures for April.

INTERNAL CBP DOC WARNS OF ‘SIGNIFICANT SAFETY IMPLICATIONS’ OF TITLE 42 LIFT, CARTEL HOLD ON CENTRAL AMERICA

""The Biden administration has little concern for maintaining public safety and even less for following administrative procedures,"" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a statement after the arguments. ""Our coalition of state attorneys general will continue fighting to preserve Title 42 with the hope of maintaining some accountability and sanity at our southern border.""

Several immigrant activist groups have asked Summerhays to allow Title 42 to be lifted as planned in California and New Mexico, two states not included in the lawsuit. But the Republican states have sought an injunction that would be applied nationwide due to the national implications of the policy.

Such a ruling may relieve the Biden administration of a difficult political situation. It is facing pressure from Republicans as well as moderate Democrats, some of whom are in tight re-election races, who have signed onto legislation to delay Title 42 until 60 days after the CDC ends the national emergency.

In the meantime, the Biden administration has been touting its plan to surge resources to the border and move more migrants to expedited removal. So far, it does not appear to have swayed many moderate Democrats on the matter.

708,Biden says hate ‘remains a stain on the soul of America’ after Buffalo mass shooting,Jessica Chasmar,"

President Biden said Sunday that hate ""remains a stain on the soul of America"" following a mass shooting in New York that is being investigated as a hate crime.

Biden made the remarks during a speech honoring fallen police officers during the National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service, which came a day after a gunman killed ten people, including a retired police officer, at a grocery store in Buffalo.

RETIRED COP KILLED IN BUFFALO SHOOTING HAILED A ‘HERO’ BY LOCAL POLICE

""A lone gunman armed with weapons of war and a hate-filled soul shot and killed 10 innocent people in cold blood at a grocery store on Saturday afternoon,"" Biden said. ""Jill and I, like all of you, pray for the victims and the families and a devastated community. I’ve been receiving updates from my team in the White House that's in close contact with the Justice Department.

""We're still gathering the facts, but already the Justice Department has stated publicly that it is investigating the matter as a hate crime, a racially motivated act of white supremacy and violent extremism,"" he continued. ""As they do, we must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America. Hearts are heavy once again, but our resolve must never, ever waver. No one understands this more than the people sitting in front of me – moms, dads, children, family members— about how those folks in Buffalo feel today when they got the call.

""Jill and I, we know we have some idea how hard it is,"" he added. ""But I promise you, the day will come when the memory of your loved one – when you open that closet door and you smell the scent, or you go by that park you used to walk in, or you hear that song – the day will come when it will bring a smile to you lips before it brings a tear to your eyes.""

Retired Buffalo Police officer Aaron Salter is being praised as a ""hero"" by Buffalo's police department after he was killed at Tops Markets grocery store while trying to protect others from the suspected gunman, 18-year-old Payton Gendron, on Saturday afternoon.

Authorities said Sunday that Gendron likely planned out his racially motivated attack for months, pointing to a roughly 180-page manifesto Gendron posted before going on his rampage.

709,FBI agent in Michigan Gov. Whitmer kidnapping bust fired amid allegations he beat wife after swingers' party,Danielle Wallace,"

The lead FBI agent credited with thwarting a plot to kidnap Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer no longer works for the bureau – and a news report claims he was fired after allegedly beating his wife following the couple’s attendance at a swingers’ party.

Special Agent Richard Trask, 39, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, was fired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week. A spokesperson has only confirmed that he no longer works on FBI matters, but declined to provide details pending further review, WWMT reported.

Citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, The Detroit News reported that Trask was fired over allegations he smashed his wife's head against a nightstand and choked her after a dispute stemming from their attendance at a swingers' party in July. Trask is awaiting trial on assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder in connection to the incident. He faces 10 years in prison if convicted.

FBI AGENT IN GOV. WHITMER KIDNAP BUST ACCUSED OF ATTACKING WIFE: REPORT

Defense attorneys for those charged in connection to Whitmer's alleged kidnapping plot have used Trask's arrest to raise questions about other FBI agents who were working the case. On Wednesday, they asked a judge to delay the trial by 90 days to give them time to investigate conduct of other FBI agents.

Trask, who moonlights as a personal trainer, had become a known face in the case, previously testifying in court proceedings for five men awaiting federal trial scheduled to begin on Oct. 12. Prosecutors have since moved to remove Trask as a witness, citing profanity laced social media posts in which Trask criticized former President Donald Trump, The Detroit News reported.

When the kidnapping case was filed in October 2020, Whitmer, a Democrat, pinned some blame on Trump, saying his refusal to denounce far-right groups had inspired extremists across the U.S. It added even more heat to the final weeks of a tumultuous election season. Trump had earlier urged supporters to ""LIBERATE"" Michigan from stay-at-home coronavirus mandates.

Trask’s firing comes after a sixth man facing federal charges in the kidnapping plot pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years in prison last month. In his plea agreement, Ty Garbin admitted he and the five other men trained at his property near Luther, Michigan, constructing a ""shoot house"" to resemble Whitmer’s vacation home and ""assaulting it with firearms.""

The government, noting Garbin’s exceptional cooperation, asked U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker to give him credit for helping investigators reinforce their case against his co-defendants.

Once inside, he exchanged fire with store security guard Aaron Salter, who was a retired police officer, officials have said. Salter fired several rounds at Gendron before the suspect fatally shot him, Gramaglia said.

Gendron then allegedly made his way around the store shooting several other victims. When confronted by police, Gendron placed the rifle to his neck before dropping the weapon and surrendering, the police chief said.

FIRST ON FOX: Hunter Biden sent an email to his brother’s widow, Hallie Biden, pressuring her to get an HIV test as their relationship deteriorated in July 2018, about a month before he fathered a child with another woman.

In an email titled, ""YOU NEED TO GET TESTED FOR HIV HALLIE,"" obtained by Fox News Digital, Hunter demanded that Hallie get tested for HIV and inform him of the results that day. The email also accused Hallie of turning Hunter’s niece against him and called on Hallie to seek ""serious long term professional help.""

HUNTER BIDEN’S EX-LOVERS COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM AS FEDERAL GRAND JURY INVESTIGATES HIS TAX AFFAIRS

""You need to inform me of the result. TODAY,"" Hunter wrote at the time. ""I am getting tested today. I have been sick scared Hallie and you [hang] up on me. The love you give is so disturbing.""

""I love you [Hallie] even when you’re cruel,"" he added. ""GET TESTED AND TELL ME RESULTS Today.""

In earlier email exchanges that same month, Hallie called Biden a ""passive aggressive a--hole"" and Hunter advised her to ""focus on your sobriety.""

""I hope you have someone to turn to in bed in my brothers’ house and that that act of love can be for him or her or them and not a secret someone,"" Hunter wrote to Hallie on July 15, 2018. ""And don’t feel as if you lost the two best men you or anyone could have ever even dreamed of.""

Hunter revealed the details of his affair with Hallie in his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" explaining that he and Hallie started a relationship in 2016 about a year after his brother, Beau, died of brain cancer. Hunter said he successfully convinced his dad, now-President Joe Biden, to issue a statement condoning the affair in 2017 after he was initially reluctant to offer public support.

""We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness,"" the elder Biden said in a statement. ""They have mine and Jill’s full and complete support and we are happy for them.""

BIDEN ‘TRYING TO HIDE’ WHO HE HAS MET WITH, PETER SCHWEIZER SAYS

Hunter was married to Kathleen Buhle but separated at the time of the affair, and the two finalized their divorce in April 2017. During that same time, while living with Hallie, Hunter started a sexual relationship with Hallie’s older sister, Elizabeth Secundy, in addition to ex-stripper Lunden Roberts.

In July 2018, the same month that Biden sent his email to Hallie demanding she get an HIV test, Hunter was infamously blacklisted from the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles due to his drug use over the course of five months staying at the hotel, according to Miranda Devine’s book ""Laptop from Hell.""

One month later, in August 2018, Hunter’s child with Roberts was born.

Hunter and Hallie eventually split in late 2018, which became public in 2019. In one email Hunter sent to Hallie in December 2018, Hunter called her a ""clueless, middle-aged, over botoxed flat a-- loser."" One day later, Hallie responded, in part, ""Please stop the nasty emails and anger. I’m not against you.""

Hunter's jab at Hallie came in response to an email from the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children's Vice-Chair Fred Sears to Hallie, Hunter, and Valerie Biden Owens, the younger sister of President Biden, discussing salary arrangements for Josh Alcorn. Alcorn was serving as the Beau Biden Foundation's ""Chief Operating Officer"" at the time.

Biden initially denied being the father of Roberts’ child, claiming in his memoir that he had ""no recollection"" of Roberts. In January 2020, an Arkansas judge ruled that Hunter was the ""biological and legal father"" of Roberts’ child and ordered Hunter to pay back child support.

In February of this year, Roberts became the latest to testify in response to subpoenas issued in the Department of Justice's investigation into Biden's finances.

Hunter's ex-girlfriend, lingerie entrepreneur Zoe Kestan, also recently testified before the grand jury in Delaware, the New York Post reported. Kestan reportedly told the grand jury about Hunter's lavish spending habits at luxury hotels in New York and California.

Hunter, who is now married to South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen, first revealed in December 2020 that his ""tax affairs"" were under federal investigation. David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware, is overseeing the investigation.

The Senate Homeland Security Committee and Senate Finance Committee conducted an investigation in 2020 into Hunter's foreign business dealings during his father's tenure as vice president and discovered that there were at least four large transactions that banks flagged as ""potential criminal activity"" to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

A pastor who was visiting his former congregation at the Laguna Woods, California, Taiwanese Presbyterian Church helped subdue a shooter Sunday by hitting him with a chair, according to a witness.

""I heard the gun sounds,"" Geneva Presbyterian Church congregant Jerry Chen, 72, said according to the Los Angeles Times. ""Then I heard two or three more gunshots. He was just randomly shooting.""

The shooting unfolded in the Orange County city before 1:30 p.m. Sunday after churchgoers enjoyed lunch and were taking photos with former pastor Billy Chang who was visiting the U.S. after moving to Taiwan two years ago.

""Everyone had just finished lunch,"" Chen said. ""They were taking photos with Pastor Chang. I had just finished my lunch and went into the kitchen.""

The gunman opened fire on the roughly 40 people gathered, injuring five and killing one. Chen told the LA Times that the congregation is composed of mostly elderly, retired Taiwanese immigrants, with an average age of 80.

As the gunman stopped to reload his weapon, Chang was seen hitting him with a chair, Chen recounted. Other parishioners then jumped into action and tackled the gunman before hogtying him with an extension cord.

""It was amazing how brave (Chang) and the others were,"" Chen said. ""This is just so sad. I never, ever thought something like this would happen in my church, in my community.""

Chang was the pastor of the congregation for 20 years and was visiting the church for the first time since moving to Taiwan two years ago.

""That group of churchgoers displayed what we believe is exceptional heroism and bravery,"" Undersheriff Jeff Hallock said, according to the LA Times.

""It’s safe to say that had they not intervened this situation could have been much worse,"" he added.

Before services began Sunday, the parishioners greeted the gunman and welcomed him to their church. The gunman allegedly told members of the congregation that he had visited the church before, but no one recognized him, Chen recounted.

Information on the shooting is still forthcoming, but police revealed an Asian man in his 60s was taken into custody. Law enforcement sources told the LA Times that the 68-year-old man is a Las Vegas native with no clear connection to the church.

716,Human trafficking in America among worst in world: report,Andrew Keiper,"

The United States is again ranked as one of the worst countries in the world for human trafficking. According to a recently released report by the State Department, the top three nations of origin for victims of human trafficking in 2018 were the United States, Mexico and the Philippines.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered the Trafficking in Persons report, which is created annually by the State Department to document human trafficking in the year prior, and highlighted the growing focus that government agencies and nonprofit organizations have dedicated to stopping human trafficking. The Department of Justice provided more than $31 million for 45 victim service providers that offered services to trafficking survivors across the country. It was a demonstrable increase; the DOJ only provided $16 million to 18 organizations in 2017, according to the report.

At the heart of the human trafficking trade in America is simple economics: Supply and demand.

Over the last two months, Fox News has investigated human trafficking. We followed the enforcement efforts of FBI agents and police officers, documented the ways advocacy groups protect and serve survivors, and heard heart-wrenching stories of abuse, rape and recovery from numerous victims.

""The United States is the number one consumer of sex worldwide. So we are driving the demand as a society."" — Geoff Rogers, co-founder of the United States Institute Against Human Trafficking

If there’s one takeaway from our reporting, it’s that the industry is fueled by an unceasing demand. It’s here that officers focus their enforcement actions. And it's where advocates focus their education efforts to end the illicit trade.

“We have a major issue here in the United States” Geoff Rogers, co-founder of the United States Institute Against Human Trafficking (USIAHT), said in an interview with Fox News. “The United States is the No. 1 consumer of sex worldwide. So we are driving the demand as a society.”

In 2018, the DOJ began 230 federal human trafficking prosecutions, a drop from 282 in 2017. Federal convictions rose from 499 in 2017 to 526 in 2018. More than 70 percent of the cases resulted in jail sentences of more than five years, according to the State Department report.

""These are American kids, American born, 50% to 60% of them coming out of the foster care industry."" — Geoff Rogers

“We're also driving the demand with our own people, with our own kids,” Rogers said. “So there are tremendous numbers of kids, a multitude of kids that are being sold as sex slaves today in America. These are American kids, American-born, 50 percent to 60 percent of them coming out of the foster care industry.”

This assertion is confirmed by the State Department’s report, which found that children in foster care, homeless youth, undocumented immigrant children and those with substance abuse problems were especially at risk to fall into the human trafficking trap.

Rogers says that because the demand is so great in the U.S., traffickers are filling that demand with an increased supply of forced sex workers.

“So the demand here in the United States is a global one,” he said. “We do have men traveling the globe to go to places like Thailand and other places in East Asia to purchase sex with kids. But, in fact, the demand is so great that the supply has needed to be filled here in the United States.”

“Because of the demand, then these traffickers are filling that demand with supply. And the demand is so great here in the United States that they're filling the supply with our very own kids,” Rogers continued.

According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report , over 300,000 of America’s young population is considered at risk for sexual exploitation. It’s also estimated that 199,000 incidents occur within the U.S. each year.

Corporal Alan Wilkett, of the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office in Florida, operates their local Human Trafficking Task Force. He believes the best way to combat the trade is to quell the demand.

“Historically, we've allowed the sex buyer to hide behind a mask of anonymity and actually call them a ‘John,’” He said in an interview with Fox News. “We don't even call them by their name, because we let them stay behind that mask. And the only way we're going to attack the supply side is by going after the demand. And that means the sex buyer needs to be held culpable for the damage and trauma that he or she is causing.”

""Trafficking in America, if you are trafficked in the United States, 85 percent of victims that are trafficked here are from here."" — Brook Bello, founder of More Too Life

While Wilkett and other law enforcement officers focus on arrests and sting operations, leaders in the nonprofit realm take a more holistic approach to healing survivors. Brook Bello, the founder of anti-trafficking organization More Too Life in Florida, focuses on helping develop skills to lead a successful post-trafficking life.

“We work with victims that are 3 years old and up,” Bello said. “The average victim that we work with, that’s over 18, started being raped at three. Trafficking in America, if you are trafficked in the United States, 85 percent of victims that are trafficked here are from here.”

The State Department’s report similarly echoes the domestic nature of sex trafficking in the United States. Despite the growing focus and concern surrounding human trafficking, gaps exist that leave victims and survivors without the care and resources they need to build a life beyond the abuse.

“Advocates reported a significant lack of services available for men, boys, and LGBTI individuals and noted continued concern that some federal funding opportunities no longer highlight the need for services for LGBTI individuals,” the State Department said in its Trafficking in Persons report. “NGOs and survivor advocates continued to report insufficient access to emergency shelter, transitional housing, and long-term housing options for trafficking victims.”

Progress has been made on this front, but too often too many kids can’t fight their way out of the clutches of their traffickers. In cities across the nation, and along the highways that connect them, police and advocates continue their fight to eradicate human trafficking and heal those who survived.

721,"Congress holds historic public UFO hearing, as military struggles to understand 'mystery' flying phenomena",Tyler Olson,"

A House Intelligence subcommittee Tuesday is holding the first congressional hearing on UFOs in 50 years, as building evidence on the sightings raises more questions than answers.

""There are a lot of unexplained aerial phenomena. We don't know what they are, and they can't be easily rationalized as weather phenomenon or balloons or anything else. So it's quite a mystery,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said of the hearing.

""We're going to press them on some very serious issues,"" Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., who chairs the House Intelligence Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation Subcommittee, added.

REDACTED CLASSIFIED UFO REPORT REVEALS NEW INFO ON ‘SHAPES,’ INVESTIGATION INTO ‘UNEXPLAINED’ PHENOMENA

Carson said in a statement announcing the hearing that it's crucial for the government to ""seriously evaluate and respond to any potential national security risks – especially those we do not fully understand.""

The hearing on what the U.S. government officially calls ""Unidentified Aerial Phenomena"" (UAP), begins at 9 a.m. ET. It comes after years of unexplained sightings, primarily by U.S. military personnel, of flying objects, which often had no ""discernable"" propulsion systems and unusual ""movement patterns.""

A 2021 report – a redacted classified version of which was published by The Black Vault earlier this year – said the government recorded 144 reports from 2004 to 2021, including 80 that ""involved observation with multiple sensors."" The report also included information on ""common shapes"" of the UAPs, although the entire sections on the shapes are redacted.

There haven't been hearings in the U.S. Congress on UFOs since the 1960s. The House Committee on Science and Astronautics, led by Chairman Rep. Edward Roush, D-Ind., held one hearing on the matter in 1968. Around that time, then-Rep. Gerald Ford, R-Mich., called for investigations into the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigated UFOs and was shut down in 1969.

UFO REPORT REVEALS OFFICIALS CAN'T EXPLAIN THE MYSTERIOUS SIGHTINGS

Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie and Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray will testify at the hearing Tuesday. But it's not clear how much they will be willing or able to share in the public forum.

""I think they will be comfortable telling the public what we do know, and what is still yet to be explained,"" Schiff said when asked what people can expect from the hearing. ""But they'll be very careful not to speculate that this is some extraterrestrial or this is some foreign adversary with some… unknown technology. They will set up the limits of what we know what we don't.""

The government has said that UAP ""probably lack a single explanation."" Neither classified nor unclassified reports from the government so far rule out space aliens. But other possible explanations are ""airborne clutter"" like birds and balloons, ""natural atmospheric phenomena,"" like ice crystals, highly classified U.S. government programs, or ""foreign adversary systems"" from Russia, China or other countries.

""Let's assume that it's… another country, another nation or another group that's operating something that we don't fully understand,"" Heritage Foundation senior fellow for naval warfare and advanced technology Brent Sadler told Fox News Digital. ""That's a definitely a security threat… that we can't necessarily defend against because you can't defend against something you don't understand.""

PENTAGON LAUNCHING NEW UFO INVESTIGATION UNIT, REPLACING NAVY GROUP: REPORT

Sadler added that the classified nature of the government's UAP information could make it hard to learn much from the hearing. Foreign nations will likely be watching Moultrie and Bray to potentially learn new information about U.S. military capabilities. But, he said, lawmakers could use general questions to get an idea of how much a threat UAPs actually are.

""They don't have to go classified if they ask it in the general and say, ‘Are any of these reported incidents… a national security threat for our defense?’"" Sadler said. ""Hopefully the answer is no.""

Sadler further added that even if UAPs don't belong to a hostile power, there's a risk for military personnel, especially pilots, if they cannot detect UAPs or don't know how to react to them.

If UAPs are from a foreign nation, Sadler said, they are most likely for intelligence purposes. He said if the hearing reveals that to be true, it could ""galvanize"" Americans to refocus on science like the ""Sputnik moment where the Soviet Union launched the satellite, and it scared everyone into action.""

The push for more information on UFOs is one of the few bipartisan issues in Congress.

In 2021 a group of bipartisan Senators introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling for a new government office as a ""central repository"" for UFO information and their threat to the U.S. It would be a collaborative effort between the Defense Department and the Director of National Intelligence.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., led the effort, joined by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and several others across the aisle. In the House, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a member of the Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation Subcommittee, said she wants the Tuesday hearing to focus on protecting Americans.

""My hope is that this hearing focuses on transparency for the public and protecting our national security,"" Stefanik told Fox News.

722,Sussmann-Durham trial: Prosecution says Clinton lawyer used FBI to create an 'October surprise' against Trump,Brooke Singman,"

Special Counsel John Durham’s team in its opening argument Tuesday alleged that former Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann used the FBI as ""a political tool"" to ""manipulate"" the bureau on ""the eve"" of the 2016 presidential election to create an ""October surprise"" against then-candidate Donald Trump — a plan that ""largely succeeded.""

Sussmann is charged with making a false statement to the FBI when he told former FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016 — less than two months before the presidential election — that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and attended a meeting with Baker where he presented ""purported data and ‘white papers’ that allegedly demonstrated a covert communicates channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

SUSSMANN-DURHAM TRIAL: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW AHEAD OF OPENING ARGUMENTS, FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY

Durham’s team alleges Sussmann was, in fact, doing work for two clients: the Hillary Clinton campaign and a technology executive, Rodney Joffe. Following the meeting with Baker, Sussmann billed the Hillary Clinton campaign for his work.

Sussmann has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Federal prosecutor Deborah Brittain Shaw delivered the government’s opening argument, saying the case is one ""about privilege.""

""Privilege of a lawyer who thought he could lie to the FBI without consequences; privilege of a lawyer who thought that for the powerful, normal rules didn’t apply,"" Shaw argued on behalf of the government.

The government argued that in bringing the ""serious allegations"" to the FBI, Sussmann ""bypassed normal channels and went straight to the FBI’s top lawyer,"" then-General Counsel James Baker.

""He then sat across from that lawyer and lied to him,"" Shaw said, noting the lie was ""designed to achieve political"" ends, and ""designed to inject the FBI into the election.""

The government, in delivering the argument, wanted to ""address the proverbial elephant in the room.""

""Some people have very strong feelings about politics, and about Russia, and many people have strong feelings about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,"" Shaw said. ""We are not here because allegations involve either.""

""We are here because the FBI is our institution that should don’t be used as a political tool for anyone — not Republicans, not Democrats, not anyone,"" Shaw said, urging jurors to leave their own ""political views"" out of the decisions they make in the courtroom.

The government said the evidence presented throughout the trial will show that ""the lie"" was part of a ""bigger plan,"" one to ""create an October surprise on the eve of the presidential election.""

""A plan that used and manipulated the FBI. A plan that the defendant hoped would trigger news outlets and trigger an FBI investigation,"" Shaw said. ""A plan that largely succeeded.""

The government plans to discuss details of Sussmann’s meetings with the opposition research firm the Clinton campaign hired to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign — Fusion GPS.

JURY SELECTED IN DURHAM-SUSSMANN TRIAL: OPENING ARGUMENTS, TESTIMONY FROM DEMOCRATIC LAWYER MARC ELIAS TO COME

The now-infamous anti-Trump dossier, which contained allegations of purported coordination between Trump and the Russian government, was authored by Christopher Steele, an ex-British intelligence officer, and commissioned by Fusion GPS.

Perkins Coie, where Sussmann had been employed, is the law firm through which the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Clinton campaign funded the dossier.

""Opposition research is something that happens in politics and has for years — Republicans do it, Democrats do it,"" the government argued, noting that ""opposition research is not illegal,"" but lying to the FBI is.

The government told the jury that during the trial, it will present physical evidence, including handwritten notes from FBI officials, two thumb drives that Sussmann gave to the FBI containing the allegations against Trump and also testimony and documents to prove their charge against Sussmann.

""This is a case about privilege,"" the government reiterated. ""No one should be so privileged as to have the ability to walk into the FBI and lie for political ends.""

""Whether we are Democrats or Republicans, whether we hate Donald Trump or love him, we have to believe some things are above politics,"" the government said, adding that the FBI ""should never be used as a political pawn.""

Moments later, Sussmann’s defense began to present its opening argument, which was delivered by Michael Bosworth.

Bosworth argued that Sussmann, a well-known and high-profile national security lawyer ""didn’t lie to the FBI"" and ""wouldn’t lie to the FBI"" based on his years of experience, his relationships with national security officials within the government, and his character.

DURHAM RELEASES FORMER CLINTON LAWYER MICHAEL SUSSMANN'S TEXT MESSAGE, SAYS HE PUT 'LIE IN WRITING'

Bosworth urged the jury to consider four questions when evaluating evidence and testimony throughout the trial: ""What did Sussmann actually say to the FBI? Is what he said false? Did he intend to say something false? Did it matter?""

""The government has to prove all of these beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Bosworth said. ""They're going to stumble at every turn.""

Bosworth called the charge against his client ""nonsensical,"" calling Sussmann ""a good man, a family man,"" and an ""honest man.""

Bosworth also stressed that, at the time of the meeting with Baker in September 2016, it was well known that Sussmann had represented the DNC, after the party’s servers were hacked by Russians, and that he was representing the Clinton campaign.

Bosworth argued that Sussmann would have no reason to conceal his work for the Clinton campaign.

During the opening argument, it became clear that the defense will likely hit Baker’s credibility, invoking his past testimony, flip-flopping on whether Sussmann mentioned he was working on behalf of clients, or on his own as a concerned citizen, when he presented the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations.

Bosworth also argued that Baker did not memorialize the September 2016 conversation with Sussmann in any way, and stressed that the meeting took place just between Baker and Sussmann.

With regard to the data, Bosworth said Sussmann brought the information first to the New York Times, but when it appeared the story would be imminently published, Sussmann took initiative to reach out to the FBI so that the bureau would not be caught ""by surprise.""

""Sussmann said there might be smoke, they look, and said, no fire,"" Bosworth said of the FBI’s investigation into the data allegedly showing a connection between Trump and the Kremlin-tied bank. ""Which is what they do with tips they get day, after day, after day. That’s what the FBI does.""

Bosworth argued that Sussmann ""did not go to the FBI to do the Clinton campaign’s bidding,"" saying the meeting would have been ""the opposite of what they wanted.""

""Use your common sense: if the Clinton campaign really wanted to send in an attorney to conceal his relationship with the campaign, he is the last person they would send in,"" Bosworth said. ""The FBI knew he represented partisan clients.""

He added: ""They knew from the beginning, no matter what Sussmann said, there could be politics afoot… they knew he was a lawyer for the DNC and for the Clinton campaign.""

The defense also plans to introduce evidence of handwritten notes prepared by Baker ahead of a meeting to brief senior officials at the Trump Justice Department on the Alfa Bank allegations.

The Baker notes, which Bosworth briefly showed to the jury, appeared to state that Sussmann did come to the FBI with the allegations ""as an attorney on behalf of his client.""

HILLARY CLINTON 2016 TWEETS PUSHED NOW-DEBUNKED CLAIM OF TRUMP USE OF 'COVERT SERVER' LINKED TO RUSSIA

On the prosecution side, Durham’s team is set to introduce a text message Sussmann sent to Baker requesting the September 2016 meeting.

""Jim — it’s Michael Sussmann. I have something time-sensitive (and sensitive) I need to discuss,"" the text message stated, according to Durham. ""Do you have availability for a short meeting tomorrow? I’m coming on my own — not on behalf of a client or company — want to help the Bureau. Thanks.""

Baker replied: ""OK. I will find a time. What might work for you?""

Durham, in a filing in the weeks leading up to the trial, said ""the night before the defendant met with the general counsel, the defendant conveyed the same lie in writing and sent the following text message to the general counsel’s personal cellphone.""

The government, during opening arguments Tuesday, referenced that same text message.

After opening arguments, the government is set to bring two FBI special agents as witnesses, as well as former Clinton campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who worked with Sussmann at Perkins Coie. Elias has testified before the grand jury as part of the government’s case.

DURHAM TEAM ARGUES 'STRONG INTERSECTION' BETWEEN CHRISTOPHER STEELE WORK, SUSSMANN ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TRUMP

Meanwhile, Durham in February first revealed that the government would attempt to establish at trial that among the data ""exploited"" was domain name system (DNS) internet traffic relating to ""a particular healthcare provider, Trump Tower, Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building and the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP).""

In February, Durham said data was exploited ""by mining the EOP's DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,"" adding that the data was used to establish ""an inference"" and ""narrative"" tying Trump to Russia.

Durham also alleges that Sussmann in February 2017 provided an ""updated set of allegations,"" including the Alfa Bank claims, and additional allegations related to Trump, to a second U.S. government agency, which Fox News has confirmed was the CIA.

In defense of Sussmann’s meeting with the CIA, defense attorney Bosworth, on Tuesday, argued that he was""motivated by an actual interest in national security.""

""If he wasn’t motivated by an actual interest in national security, why did he go to the CIA, months after the election?"" Bosworth asked the jury. ""He had a genuine interest in national security and doing the right thing.""

Tuesday is the first full day of the first trial stemming from Durham’s years-long investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.

Durham was present in the courtroom for jury selection Monday, and again for opening arguments Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper welcomed Durham to the courtroom.

Durham was tapped in 2019 by Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the FBI’s original investigation into the Trump campaign, which led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel.

At the time, Durham was serving as U.S. attorney for Connecticut.

Mueller's investigation yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.

In October 2020, Barr appointed Durham as special counsel to ensure that he would be able to continue his investigative work — regardless of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

Durham has indicted three people as part of his investigation: Sussmann in September 2021, Igor Danchenko in November 2021 and Kevin Clinesmith in August 2020.

Meanwhile, Cooper, who is presiding over the trial, was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2014 and received unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

Early in his career, Cooper served in the Justice Department, and later joined private practice. Cooper worked in private practice for nearly two decades, and specialized in defending clients in white-collar criminal matters.",https://www.foxnews.com
723,Australian man who insulted Chinese President Xi Jinping says police told him he will be charged,Louis Casiano,"

An Australian man who held up a sign displaying an insult against Chinese President Xi Jinping at a busy Asian market in Sydney said he's been told by authorities he could be charged over the incident even though he was reportedly attacked by Chinese nationalists.

Drew Pavlou was filmed holding the sign that read ""F*** Xi Jinping"" in Chinese on Saturday at the Eastwood Plaza. The signage quickly triggered an angry reaction from some shoppers, some of whom vented their frustration, according to footage of the incident on Pavlou's Twitter account.

.The video shows angry people confronting him.

""America has genocide,"" according to subtitles in a video of the incident.

WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE

Another man snatches the sign and throws it to the ground. One said he was ""disrespecting Chinese here."" During the encounter, Pavlou tells the crowd he is non-violent.

He later tweeted that the New South Wales Police Force contacted him to inform him that detectives were investigating him and that he would likely be charged.

""NSW Police want to charge me for holding a sign insulting Xi Jinping while campaigning in Sydney,"" Lavlou wrote. ""They won’t even tell me what I’m being charged with. I’m sick of attacks on free speech, Australia desperately needs a Bill of Rights to protect free expression.""

He also tweeted about the Chinese government's oppression of Uyghur Muslims who have been rounded up and detained in camps.

A spokesperson for the police force declined to confirm that Pavlou was being investigated but said they were investigating an alleged assault that occurred during a political protest at the Eastwood Plaza.

""Following inquiries, investigators attended an Eastwood home and spoke with a 48-year-old man about 4.30pm today,"" a police statement said. ""He was issued a court attendance notice for Common Assault and is due to appear at Hornsby Local Court on Wednesday.""

In a tweet, Pavlou called threats of being charged an ""intimidation tactic.""

In a Facebook post, he said he was making a simple point.

Amber Heard 's new head of PR has a checkered past and left two jobs after sexual harassment claims were leveled against him, according to a new report.

Angered over a slew of negative headlines, Heard abruptly fired her PR team mid-trial and replaced them with David Shane, 49, of Shane Communications to push a narrative of ex-husband Johnny Depp as an alleged drug-addled wife-beater.

JOHNNY DEPP V. AMBER HEARD DEFAMATION TRIAL: LIVE UPDATES

But Shane, it turns out, has been dogged by impropriety allegations, according to an exclusive report from the DailyMail.

His alleged misconduct is such common knowledge that he's been nicknamed ""Hurricane Shane"" and ""the walking #MeToo case of the PR world,"" industry insiders told the newspaper.

HR departments at both Hewlett-Packard and Juniper investigated him for sexual harassment, according to a former colleague.

He served as vice president of communications at Hewlett-Packard from 2008 to 2010 and had the same role at Juniper from 2010 to 2012, the report says.

It's unclear if he left the prior companies due to the allegations. He has denied all wrongdoing through his lawyers and said the allegations are a distraction from the trial.

FROM KENTUCKY TO HOLLYWOOD: INSIDE JOHNNY DEPP’S DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD AND RISE TO STARDOM IN HIS OWN WORDS

Depp, 58, is suing Heard, 36, for $50 million over an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post calling herself a victim of domestic abuse. Heard is countersuing for $100 million, accusing Depp of conspiring with his attorney to defame her by branding her allegations a ""hoax.""

As the two sides duke it out in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia, their respective PR teams have been in high gear trying to control the narrative.

But now Shane has to spin his own. A former model, Hollie Doker, 32, told the newspaper that in late 2018 Shane took her out on two dates after the pair met on the dating app Raya.

After the second date, they went back to his West Hollywood condo and he allegedly tried to force her to give him oral sex, Doker said.

""At that point he started getting super aggressive and he pushed my head down, towards that [his crotch]. I told him no and I got up. He got angry and was like, 'I’ll call you a f***ing Uber.’""

Doker said she filed a complaint with Raya and the company deleted Shane’s account. Raya declined to comment to the DailyMail.

""David Shane adamantly denies Hollie Doker’s allegation, which dramatically conflicts with Ms. Doker’s original account that she posted over three years ago,"" Shane's attorney Rebecca Kaufman told Fox News Digital.

727,MSNBC columnist: Men should get 'vasectomies' in response to 'extreme right-wing minority rule government',Gabriel Hays,"

MSNBC columnist Liz Plank wrote an opinion column Tuesday encouraging men to get vasectomies to further the fight for abortion rights.

In her piece, Plank began with some data showing that men’s internet searches for information regarding vasectomies have increased since the Supreme Court draft opinion leaked indicating that Roe v. Wade could be overturned.

She reported, ""Data shows daily searches related to vasectomies are up 99 percent and searches for the term 'how much is a vasectomy' are up 250 percent."" Plank also observed that Michigan, ""one of the 13 states with a trigger law that would automatically ban or severely restrict abortion if the Supreme Court were to go ahead with its leaked decision,"" leads in the number of men searching for info on vasectomies.

ELON MUSK LIGHTS UP TWITTER AFTER DECLARING HE'LL VOTE GOP NEXT ELECTION: 'THE LEFT SHOULD REFLECT ON WHY'

Plank talked to Manuel Benavides, a family man in Texas with a wife and two kids, who discussed getting a vasectomy with his wife after Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, signed the Texas Heartbeat Bill last year. Once the Court draft opinion leaked, he made up his mind to get one.

He told the author, ""My wife has had a negative reaction to the pill, and I don't think that the responsibility of whether we become pregnant or not should fall on my partner.""

Plank reported men in blue states where abortion is in less danger also ""are making the decision to shift the responsibility of family planning onto their bodies.""

She was encouraged that plenty of men seem to support the pro-choice movement. ""The presence of men at the various national protests held across the country, highlighted by the hashtag #MenAtTheMarch, reflects Pew Research Center data showing that men tend to be just as supportive as women when it comes to abortion rights,"" she wrote.

Plank then mentioned Matthew, a 36-year-old Massachusetts resident she interviewed over email, who described how ""he and his wife booked an appointment for a vasectomy last week"" because of the leak. He stated, ""It really is difficult to emphasize how much the SCOTUS leak changed our trajectory on this. We had joked about scheduling it around a major sporting event, now we just want to get it done as soon as possible.""

LA TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD BLAMES ‘NORMALIZATION’ OF ‘VIRULENT WHITE SUPREMACY’ ON REPUBLICANS

""For other men, getting a vasectomy is a way to reclaim their freedom in a country that’s become more and more oppressive, especially for men with intersecting identities,"" she wrote, before describing an example of an autistic man who ""already feels like his reproductive rights are under threat.""

The gentleman, Mickey Rowe, told her ""since my vasectomy was consensual, it was something I was choosing for myself, it felt empowering.""

Plank then scolded men in the U.S. on the vasectomy front, writing, ""American men are well behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to vasectomies."" She explained that ""men in Canada and the U.K. are twice as likely to get vasectomies compared to their female partners getting sterilized, but in America the figures are reversed.""

She followed that up with a strong hint for pro-choice men, ""Where gently encouraging men to get vasectomies hasn’t exactly worked, maybe an extreme right-wing minority rule government encoding forced birth into law will.""

""It’s unclear whether this surge in men’s interest in family planning will last, but given that many states have only become more rabidly dystopian in their anti-abortion rights endeavors, it’s at least plausible this is more than just a passing trend,"" Plank continued.

""While some ultra-conservatives may have believed banning abortion would lead to more babies, their radical stance may have just encouraged men to go to greater lengths to do the exact opposite,"" she wrote, perhaps thinking that getting vasectomies will ""own the cons.""

""But in a world where women don’t have a guaranteed constitutional right to access abortion and men don’t have any laws regulating their bodies, the burden of family planning will have to fall on them. If that scares the men who haven’t been showing up to the fight for reproductive justice, they'll need to put up a bigger fight,"" she concluded.",https://www.foxnews.com

729,Dallas police chief: Koreatown hair salon shooting suspect ‘motivated by hate',Louis Casiano,"

A man suspected of wounding three Korean women in a Dallas hair salon during a shooting authorities are investigating as a hate crime was arrested Tuesday and is suspected in a recent string of shootings at or near Asian businesses, authorities said.

Jeremy Smith, 37, was booked into the Dallas County jail and is charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He allegedly walked into the Hair World Salon on May 11 and opened fire on the seven people inside with a .22 caliber rifle, Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia told reporters.

Smith got off 13 shots before fleeing into a minivan, he said.

""We believe the shooting was intentional,"" said Garcia. ""The actions and the investigation has revealed to us that this was motivated by hate.""

TEXAS LAW ENFORCEMENT SEARCH FOR ESCAPED CONVICTED MURDERER ON HORSEBACK; REWARD INCREASED

One victim was shot in the foot, another in the lower back and the third in the right forearm, Garcia said. They are expected to recover.

The FBI said it is investigating the shooting as a hate crime. Surveillance video captured Smith's van with specific details and determined it to be a 2004 Honda Odyssey, authorities said.

An arrest warrant affidavit said Smith drove the minivan with a paper license plate that matched several of the numbers seen by witnesses. He also admitted to being in the area on the day of the shooting, Fox Dallas reported. A vehicle crash that occurred two years ago with an Asian male resulted in him having panic attacks and ""delusions"" when around people of Asian descent, Garcia said.

Smith was also fired from his previous job at an Ulta Beauty warehouse for attacking his Asian boss, the document states.

""On Monday, three people in a Korean-owned hair salon in Dallas were gunned by yet another White supremacy replacement theorist,"" Beatty said to the assembled crowd.

DALLAS POLICE CHIEF: KOREATOWN HAIR SALON SHOOTING SUSPECT ‘MOTIVATED BY HATE’

""We are sick of the pipeline from racist rhetoric to racist violence,"" Beatty continued.

In addition to botching the date of the shooting, Beatty got a key detail wrong about the ""White supremacy replacement theorist"" charged with attacking the Dallas salon: the suspect is Black.

Jeremy Smith, 37, was booked into the Dallas County jail and is charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He allegedly walked into the Hair World Salon on May 11 and opened fire on the seven people inside with a .22 caliber rifle, Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia told reporters.

Smith got off 13 shots before fleeing into a minivan, he said.

The FBI said it is investigating the shooting as a hate crime. Surveillance video captured Smith's van with specific details and determined it to be a 2004 Honda Odyssey, authorities said.

An arrest warrant affidavit said Smith drove the minivan with a paper license plate that matched several of the numbers seen by witnesses. He also admitted to being in the area on the day of the shooting, Fox Dallas reported. A vehicle crash that occurred two years ago with an Asian male resulted in him having panic attacks and ""delusions"" when around people of Asian descent, Garcia said.

Smith was also fired from his previous job at an Ulta Beauty warehouse for attacking his Asian boss, the document states.

A spokesperson for the Congressional Black Caucus, which Beatty chairs, told Fox News Digital that the congresswoman's remarks were a staff error and that she condemns racial violence of all kinds.

732,"At least 135 teachers, aides charged with child sex crimes this year alone",Jessica Chasmar,"

At least 135 teachers and teachers’ aides have been arrested so far this year on child sex-related crimes in the U.S., ranging from child pornography to raping students.

An analysis conducted by Fox News Digital looked at local news stories week by week featuring arrests of teachers and teachers’ aides on child sex-related crimes in school districts across the country. Arrests that weren't publicized were not counted in the analysis, meaning the true number may well be higher.

TEACHER AT ELITE SPORTS ACADEMY ACCUSED OF HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH UNDERAGE STUDENT

The analysis found that at least 135 teachers and teachers’ aides have been arrested in 41 states between January 1 and May 13, which works out to about an arrest a day on average.

The vast majority of the arrested educators were men.

Of the 135 arrests, at least 102, or 76%, involved alleged crimes against students.

The 135 educators included 117 teachers, 11 teachers' aides and seven substitute teachers.

Many of the arrests involved especially heinous allegations.

On April 11, police in California charged Anthony James Phillips, a 61-year-old former teacher at Cupertino Middle School in Sunnyvale, with aggravated sexual assault of a child, forcible penetration with a foreign object, and forcible penetration with a foreign object upon a child.

Phillips is accused of raping a student in 2009 when he was still a teacher at Cupertino.

Anessa Paige Gower, a 35-year-old former biology teacher at Making Waves Academy in Richmond, California, was charged with 29 counts of child molestation on April 8.

Gower is accused of sexually abusing seven students between 2021-2022 when she was a teacher at Making Waves, with allegations including forcible sodomy of minors and sharing sexually graphic photos over online platforms. She is due back in court on June 2.

William Landon Smith, a 31-year-old former science teacher at Cape Fear High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was charged with 27 counts of first-degree sexual exploitation of a minor, 28 counts of indecent liberties with a student, and one count of secretly using or installing a photographic imaging device to arouse or gratify sexual desire on March 18.

Smith is accused of inappropriately communicating with students via social media apps like Snapchat when he was a teacher at Cape Fear.

John M. Doty, a 35-year-old former biology teacher at Career Academy South Bend in Indiana, was charged with two counts of rape, one count of attempted rape and six counts of child seduction on Feb. 9.

Doty is accused of repeatedly raping a 16-year-old female student and threatening to kill her. He is scheduled to stand trial in January 2023.

Danielle Fischer, a 29-year-old former substitute teacher in the Roxana and Alton school districts, was charged with criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse on Feb. 4.

Fischer is accused of sexually assaulting two teenage male students at her home in Edwardsville during summer break last year. A Madison County grand jury later added child pornography to the charges.

Erika Sanzi, director of outreach for Parents Defending Education, told Fox News Digital that the issue of teacher sex crimes against students needs to be more thoroughly examined by the federal government. She cited the Department of Education’s 2004 report, which claimed that nearly 9.6% of students are targets of educator sexual misconduct sometime during their school career.

""Educator sexual abuse is a major problem that largely gets ignored because it's so uncomfortable to talk about,"" Sanzi said in a statement. ""While a very small fraction of educators and school employees prey on the children in their care, one bad actor can do damage to many students.""

""The last federally commissioned study on the issue was in 2004, pre-smart phone and those who study the issue closely say that the problem has been exacerbated by the ease of communication that a smart phone provides,"" she continued. ""We need to get much more honest about the problem, study it again and ensure that we have policies and laws in place that protect children. It is currently legal in Massachusetts and Rhode Island for teachers and other adults in positions of authority to have sexual relationships with students once they turn 14. After a 5-year effort, RI finally appears poised to change that this year.""

Sanzi was referring to a bipartisan bill in Rhode Island that would make it a crime for a teacher or person of authority to have sexual contact with someone under the age of 18.

Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said the lack of research on teacher sex crimes against students is a ""travesty.""

""The public school system has a serious child sex abuse problem,"" he told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""The last significant federal study on this topic, which was conducted by the Department of Education in 2004, suggested that millions of American schoolchildren are victims of teacher sexual misconduct in each generation of K-12 students—and there hasn't been any significant research since then.

""This is a travesty,"" he continued. ""Parents deserve to know exactly what's happening in the public school system and deserve to have tools for protecting their children from abuse. Congress should immediately fund a $25 million research program into child sexual abuse in public schools and provide complete transparency for parents. The first duty of public schools is to keep kids safe—and, tragically, that's not happening in far too many cases.""",https://www.foxnews.com

735,"Hillary Clinton approved dissemination of Trump-Russian bank allegations to media, campaign manager testifies",Brooke Singman,"

WASHINGTON — Former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook testified Friday that then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton approved the dissemination of materials alleging a covert communications channel between the Trump Organization and Russia’s Alfa Bank to the media, despite campaign officials not being ""totally confident"" in the legitimacy of the data.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker testified Thursday that the bureau investigated the data alleging a Trump connection to the Kremlin-linked bank, and found that ""there was nothing there.""

SPECIAL COUNSEL JOHN DURHAM'S PROSECUTION OF MICHAEL SUSSMANN: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

Mook was called to the stand for testimony by Michael Sussmann’s defense Friday.

During cross-examination by government prosecutor Andrew DeFillippis Friday, Mook was asked about the campaign’s understanding of the Alfa Bank allegations against Trump and whether they planned to release the data to the media.

Mook said he was first briefed about the Alfa Bank issue by campaign general counsel Marc Elias, who at the time was a partner at lawfirm Perkins Coie.

Mook testified that he was told that the data had come from ""people that had expertise in this sort of matter.""

SUSSMANN-DURHAM TRIAL: PROSECUTION SAYS CLINTON LAWYER USED FBI TO CREATE AN 'OCTOBER SURPRISE' AGAINST TRUMP

Mook said the campaign was not totally confident in the legitimacy of the data, but had hoped to give the information to a reporter who could further ""run it down"" to determine if it was ""accurate"" or ""substantive.""

He also said he discussed whether to give the information to a reporter with senior campaign officials, including campaign chairman John Podesta, senior policy advisor, now White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and communications director Jennifer Palmieri.

""I discussed it with Hillary as well,"" Mook said.

""I don’t remember the substance of the conversation, but notionally, the discussion was, hey, we have this and we want to share it with a reporter,"" Mook said.

The government asked Mook if Clinton approved ""the dissemination"" of the data to the media.

""She agreed,"" Mook testified.

Mook later said he ""can't recall the exact sequence of events,"" when asked if he shared the idea to give the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations to the media with Clinton before or after the decision was made.

""All I remember is that she agreed with the decision,"" Mook testified.

BAKER SAYS FBI INVESTIGATED SUSSMANN CLAIMS OF TRUMP, RUSSIAN BANK CONNECTION: 'THERE WAS NOTHING THERE'

Sussmann has been charged with making a false statement to the FBI when he told Baker in September 2016, less than two months before the presidential election, that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and attended a meeting in which he presented ""purported data and ‘white papers’ that allegedly demonstrated a covert communicates channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

Durham’s team alleges Sussmann was, in fact, doing work for two clients: the Hillary Clinton campaign and a technology executive, Rodney Joffe. Following the meeting with Baker, Sussmann billed the Hillary Clinton campaign for his work.

Sussmann has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Mook, earlier in questioning from the defense, was asked whether he or anyone on the Clinton campaign approved or gave Sussmann permission to bring the allegations to the FBI, to which he said: ""No.""

Later, the defense further questioned Mook, asking if Hillary Clinton herself approved Sussmann going to the FBI.

""I'm not aware,"" Mook testified.

When asked again, he said: ""I don't know…I don't know why she would.""

The government, in its opening statement Tuesday, argued that Sussmann's delivery of the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations to the FBI was part of the Clinton campaign's plan to create an ""October surprise"" against then-candidate Donald Trump.

The government moved to admit a tweet from Clinton dated Oct. 31, 2016 as evidence, despite U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper ruling last month that the court would exclude that tweet as hearsay.

SUSSMANN-DURHAM TRIAL: MARC ELIAS SAYS HE BRIEFED CLINTON CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS ON FUSION GPS OPPO AGAINST TRUMP

Cooper, Friday, granted the government’s motion to admit the Clinton tweet, which stated:

""Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank.""

Clinton also shared a statement from Jake Sullivan, which stated: ""This could be the most direct link yet between Donald Trump and Moscow. Computer scientists have uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank.""

Sullivan said the ""secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump’s ties to Russia.""

""This line of communication may help explain Trump’s bizarre adoration of Vladimir Putin and endorsement of so many pro-Kremlin positions throughout this campaign,"" Sullivan's 2016 statement continued. ""It raises even more troubling questions in light of Russia’s masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign.""

Sullivan added that they ""can only assume federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia’s meddling in our elections.""

When asked for the definition of an ""October surprise"" Friday, Mook testified that it is ""the idea that you have a devastating piece of opposition research and drop it on candidate so the candidate doesn't have time to respond or recover from it and, as a result, loses the election.""

When pressed to identify the date of the Clinton tweet for the jury, Mook stated: ""Oct. 31, 2016.""

Mook defended the tweet saying: ""I did not see it as some sort of silver bullet and I don't think that others on the campaign did either.""

As for the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations in general, Mook said: ""We thought this was highly suspect and, if it was true, we wanted the American public to know about it for sure.""

Mook again called the data ""certainly alarming and suspicious.""

Meanwhile, Baker testified Thursday that the FBI began an investigation into the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations, which lasted ""several weeks, maybe a month, maybe a month and a half.""

""We concluded there was no substance,"" Baker testified. ""We couldn’t confirm it. We could not confirm there was a surreptitious communications channel.""

Baker added: ""There was nothing there.""

In testimony on Tuesday afternoon, FBI Special Agent Scott Hellman also said the data revealing the alleged covert communications channel between Trump and Russia that Sussmann brought to the FBI turned out to be untrue, and said he did not agree with the narrative.

Hellman testified that whoever drafted the narrative describing the DNS data was ""5150,"" and clarified on the stand that meant he believed the individual who came to the conclusions ""was suffering from some mental disability.""

Mook’s testimony revealing Clinton approved the plan to share the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations with the media comes after Fox News first reported that the CIA, dating back to July 2016, had information of Clinton’s ""approval of a plan"" to tie Trump to Russia ""as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.""

Fox News obtained declassified notes from then-CIA Director John Brennan after briefing then-President Obama on July 28, 2016, memorializing Clinton’s purported ""proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.""

DNI DECLASSIFIES BRENNAN NOTES, CIA MEMO ON HILLARY CLINTON 'STIRRING UP' SCANDAL BETWEEN TRUMP, RUSSIA

The information was properly forwarded to the FBI in an Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL), and to the attention of then-FBI Director James Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok on Sept. 9, 2016.

""The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate,"" the 2016 CIA memo to Comey and Strzok stated.

736,George W. Bush makes unfortunate Iraq gaffe when condemning Putin's Ukraine invasion,Tyler O'Neil,"

Former President George W. Bush made an eye-catching gaffe regarding Iraq while condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Bush delivered remarks regarding the importance of democracy and threats to democracy in the U.S. and abroad.

""In contrast, Russian elections are rigged,"" he said. ""Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process. The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invassion of Iraq. I mean of Ukraine.""

Bush shrugged and said, under his breath, ""Iraq, too."" Russia has not invaded Iraq, and the Kremlin reportedly gave Saddam Hussein's government intelligence to combat the U.S. invasion early on.

BUSH CALLS ZELENSKYY ‘THE CHURCHILL OF OUR TIME’

""Anyway, 75,"" Bush added, referring to his age.

Bush presided over most of the war in Iraq, authorized by a bipartisan vote in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate in Oct. 2002. The war, which lasted until 2011, claimed the lives of more than 4,000 U.S. troops, along with those of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Critics have long faulted Bush for the war, claiming that Iraq did not possess the weapons of mass destruction Bush feared.

The 2002 authorization cited many reasons to invade Iraq, however, including Iraq's alleged noncompliance with the 1991 ceasefire agreement' the country's ""brutal repression of its civilian population;"" the country's harboring of members of al-Qaeda in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; Iraq's payment of bounties to the families of suicide bombers; and the governments of Turkey, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia fearing Saddam Hussein and wanting him removed.

Bush's gaffe clearly did not represent an attempt by the former president to acknowledge claims that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was ""brutal"" and ""wholly unjustified.""

Even so, many on Twitter poked fun at the former president.

""Oof. If you were George W. Bush, you think you’d just steer clear of giving any speech about one man launching a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion,"" former Rep. Justin Amash tweeted.

""George W. Bush is a war criminal,"" Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator, tweeted.

""This is the most amazing Freudian slip of all time,"" Townhall writer Scott Morefield tweeted.

""George W. Bush didn't do a Freudian slip. He did a Freudian Confession,"" John Fuelsgang, a comedian and broadcaster, wrote on Twitter.

Bush's flub came as he praised Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Dallas Morning News reported.

""The way countries conduct elections is indicative of how their leaders treat their own people, and how nations behave toward other nations,"" Bush said. ""And nowhere is this on display more clearly than Ukraine.""

738,San Francisco archbishop bars Pelosi from receiving Holy Communion due to abortion support,Adam Shaw,"

San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone announced Friday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barred from receiving Holy Communion due to her pro-abortion stance -- marking an escalation in a decades-long tension between the Roman Catholic Church and liberal Democratic politicians on abortion.

Cordileone has written to the California Democrat, informing her that she should not present herself for Holy Communion at Mass, and that priests will not distribute communion to her if she does present herself.

PELOSI LAUDS PROTESTERS USING ‘RIGHTEOUS ANGER' TO ‘MARCH AND MOBILIZE,’ AS SUPREME COURT SET TO OVERTURN ROE

""A Catholic legislator who supports procured abortion, after knowing the teaching of the Church, commits a manifestly grave sin which is a cause of most serious scandal to others. Therefore, universal Church law provides that such persons ‘are not to be admitted to Holy Communion,'"" he says in the letter.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church is unambiguous on the question of abortion, both in procuring one and assisting in the practice: ""Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion,"" the catechism says. ""This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.""

""Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,"" it says, before calling abortion and infanticide ""abominable crimes.""

It also declares that ""Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life.""

However, despite that clarity, liberal Catholic politicians have consistently attempted to try and align their Catholic beliefs with their support of abortion rights. Then New York Gov. Mario Cuomo famously declared himself personally opposed to abortion in 1984, but said he could not impose that view on the country.

But since then, Democrats such as Pelosi have been more full throated in their support of pro-abortion policies. President Biden, also a Catholic, had once supported the Hyde Amendment -- which prevented U.S. funding going to pay for abortions abroad. He flipped on that amendment when he ran for president in 2020, and recently described ""a woman’s right to choose"" as ""fundamental.""

Cordileone says in his letter that he wrote to her on April 7, informing her that ""should you not publicly repudiate your advocacy for abortion ‘rights’ or else refrain from referring to your Catholic faith in public and receiving Holy Communion, I would have no choice but to make a declaration, in keeping with canon 915, that you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion."" He says that since that time, she has not done so.

""Therefore, in light of my responsibility as the Archbishop of San Francisco to be 'concerned for all the Christian faithful entrusted to [my] care"" (Code of Canon Law, can. 383, §1), by means of this communication I am hereby notifying you that you are not to present yourself for Holy Communion and, should you do so, you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion, until such time as you publically repudiate your advocacy for the legitimacy of abortion and confess and receive absolution of this grave sin in the sacrament of Penance."" he said.

Pelosi has sparred with the Church for years on the matter as she has tried to present herself both as a ""devout"" Catholic, while also a full-throated supporter of a practice that the Catholic Church condemns as a moral evil.

PELOSI'S BISHOP CALLS FOR MASSIVE ‘CAMPAIGN OF PRAYER AND FASTING’ FOR ‘HER CONVERSION OF HEART’ ON ABORTION

In a 2008 interview, Pelosi claimed that ""as a devout, practicing Catholic,"" the Church has ""not been able to make that definition"" of when life begins -- a remark that brought a slew of criticism from a number of top U.S. bishops – and then said that ""the point is, it shouldn't have an impact on the woman's right to choose."" In that interview she also said she wanted abortion to be ""rare.""

But in the wake of the leaked opinion this month suggesting that the Supreme Court will soon overturn Roe v Wade, Pelosi has not talked about reducing abortion, but she has continued to claim that her pro-choice stance is in line with Catholic teaching.

""This [topic] really gets me burned up in case you didn't notice, because again I'm very Catholic, devout, practicing, all of that. They would like to throw me out. But I'm not going because I don't want to make their day,"" she said this month.

""For too long Catholic public officials have created confusion and disunity by advocating for policies that destroy innocent human life – in direct contradiction of the teachings of the Catholic faith,"" Brian Burch, the president of advocacy group CatholicVote, said after Cordileone's announcement. ""The persistent disobedience of these public officials is a source of enormous sadness and scandal that begged for a response.""

Pelosi met with Pope Francis last year, where the Vatican did not say if the topic of abortion was discussed. Pope Francis has compared having an abortion to hiring a hitman but has also been cautious about suggesting politicians be barred from communion.

""I have never refused the Eucharist to anyone,"" the pope said last year, although he said that he did not recall a time when a politician stood staunchly against Church teaching on abortion and came to him for communion.

He referred to communion as ""a gift"" and not ""a prize for the perfect."" In that same interview, however, he emphasized that the Catholic Church views abortion as homicide.

""Whoever has an abortion kills,"" the pope said. ""It is a human life.""

A dark money nonprofit aligned with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi received a multimillion-dollar cash infusion from a secret money group fueled by a Swiss billionaire.

The Pelosi-aligned nonprofit, House Majority Forward, received a $3 million donation from the California-based Fund for a Better Future in 2020, tax forms show, which was its largest contribution that year. Neither group makes its donors public.

But as Fund for a Better Future obscures its funders, the Berger Action Fund, a nonprofit established by Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, reported on its own tax forms that it had sent $25 million to the fund between April 2019 and March 2021.

NANCY PELOSI-ALIGNED DARK MONEY NONPROFIT HAS BEEN OUT OF COMPLIANCE IN CALIFORNIA FOR MONTHS, FILINGS SHOW

House Majority Forward is the nonprofit affiliate of the Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC, which works to retain Democrats in the House of Representatives. The nonprofit funneled $10 million into its affiliated PAC in 2020, federal filings show.

The Wyss-backed Fund For a Better Future also pushed hefty cash into Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams' nonprofit in 2020. On Friday, the Washington Free Beacon reported that the fund cut a $3 million check to Abrams' Fair Fight Action, which works on election laws.

Wyss has quietly positioned himself as a major financier to left-wing nonprofits, the New York Times revealed last year. The Swiss billionaire operates by funneling money through his nonprofits to other liberal groups, many of which work on election activities such as get out the vote efforts.

His citizenship, meanwhile, has come under a microscope.

Watchdog group Americans for Public Trust (APT) discovered several documents that call his citizenship into question, including a 2021 Securities and Exchange Commission filing in which he says he is a ""citizen of Switzerland.""

""Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss has been meddling in our political landscape for years by funneling hundreds of millions of dollars through the Arabella Advisors network to benefit liberal and left-wing causes,"" Caitlin Sutherland, APT's executive director, told Fox News Digital.

""While openly bragging to international press about his extensive influence in our country, Wyss' U.S.-based nonprofits have refused to admit what has now been confirmed: Wyss has never been and is still not a U.S. citizen,"" Sutherland said.

""This puts him in clear violation of our laws that prohibit foreign nationals from directly or indirectly influencing our elections,"" Sutherland said.

APT is suing the Federal Election Commission for failing to act on a complaint the group filed dealing with Wyss last year. APT wants the commission to examine if the foreign billionaire has violated federal law with his donations.

In the case of Fund for a Better Future, it is impossible to determine where Wyss' money ends up.

The Berger Action Fund told Fox News Digital that the cash is for the fund's ""work to improve policies around climate change, health care, and income inequality"" and that the group ""strictly prohibits its grant recipients from using grant funds for electoral activities, including to support or oppose political candidates or parties.""

Responding to APT's legal action, the fund added: ""This is a frivolous lawsuit levied by a partisan dark money group who opposes public lands, public health, and a strong economy. They are falsely attacking Berger Action Fund’s charitable and advocacy work in order to obstruct progress on important and popular issues that impact all Americans.""

741,Federal judge blocks Biden admin from ending Title 42 border expulsions,Adam Shaw,"

A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Biden administration from ending the Title 42 public health order on May 23 -- stopping the administration from a move that had seen significant Republican and Democratic opposition amid fears it would exacerbate the border crisis.

Judge Robert Summerhays, in the Western District of Louisiana, granted a preliminary injunction on the Biden administration’s plan to end the order on May 23. It was in response to a lawsuit by two dozen Republican states, led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri.

""Today’s ruling is a significant win as Title 42 is one of the few policies that is actually working,"" said Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich. ""I’m grateful to the court for upholding the rule of law and helping maintain some level of sanity as we continue to battle the Biden-made border crisis.""

FEDERAL JUDGE EXTENDS ORDER BLOCKING BIDEN ADMIN FROM ROLLING BACK TITLE 42 AHEAD OF HEARING

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had announced in April that the order, which has been used since March 2020 to expel a majority of migrants at the southern border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, would expire at the end of May.

""After considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics), the CDC Director has determined that an Order suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary,"" the agency said.

The move sparked outrage from both Democrats and Republicans, who warned that the move would lead to a surge in illegal immigration at the border and more people being released into the U.S.

DHS has acknowledged these concerns, saying it is planning for up to 18,000 people a day. However, it has also said that it believes that over time it will reduce the numbers encountered at the border when it re-implements criminal penalties for repeat border crossings.

A number of moderate Democrats joined Republicans in signing onto legislation preventing the administration from lifting the order until 60 days after the CDC says the national emergency on COVID-19 is over. That legislation has not yet been voted on in the Senate.

INTERNAL CBP DOC WARNS OF ‘SIGNIFICANT SAFETY IMPLICATIONS’ OF TITLE 42 LIFT, CARTEL HOLD ON CENTRAL AMERICA

The Republican lawsuit, seeking the injunction, claimed the lifting of the order violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which requires a notice-and-comment period and also bars moves deemed ""arbitrary and capricious.""

The lawsuit claims the administration failed to estimate or account for the costs to the states. They cite ""increased health care costs for aliens infected with COVID-19 and the cost of increased illegal immigration caused by the Termination Order and the presence of much greater numbers of paroled aliens with non-meritorious asylum claims who were induced to enter the United States because of the Termination Order.""

""This suit challenges an imminent, man-made, self-inflicted calamity: the abrupt elimination of the only safety valve preventing this administration’s disastrous border policies from devolving into an unmitigated catastrophe,"" the complaint read .

Summerhays, in his order, said that the record supports the states' position ""that the Termination Order will result in increased border crossings and that, based on the government's estimates, the increase may be as high as three-fold."" He also agreed with states that lifting Title 42 will increase costs on healthcare and education – and said the government did not dispute that claim.

""In sum, the Plaintiff States have demonstrated that the Termination Order will affect their ‘quasi-sovereign’ interests based on its impact on their healthcare systems and their interest in the health and welfare of their citizens,"" he said.

The judge also agreed with the states that the lifting of Title 42 was subject to the APA, and that the government did not overcome ""the presumption of reviewability under the APA.""

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt declared victory, saying the states had ""again scored a big win against the Biden Administration and obtained a preliminary injunction, keeping Title 42 in place.""

""With the illegal fentanyl and human trafficking flowing through the porous Southern border, every state is now a border state. My Office will continue to fight to secure our border and protect Missourians and Americans,"" he said.

Florida AG Ashley Moody, in a statement to Fox News Digital, said that the ruling was ""a great win for the safety and security of our nation.""

""Proud of our efforts to keep Title 42 in place,"" Moody said. ""It is a sad reality that a court must force this president to do his job and protect the American people.""

Summerhays, a Trump nominee, was widely seen as likely to issue the injunction, particularly as he had granted a temporary restraining order preventing the Department of Homeland Security from transitioning away from Title 42 by removing migrants via a process called ""expedited removal"" instead.

The Justice Department is expected to appeal the federal district court judge’s ruling, and the Supreme Court may be asked to weigh in with an emergency order, but that may not happen for the next several weeks.

DHS said in a statement that it will comply with the judge's order ""as long as it remains in place.""

""Meanwhile, DHS will continue to execute its comprehensive, whole-of-government plan to manage potential increases in the number of migrants encountered at our border. As part of this effort, DHS has established a Southwest Border Coordination Center to execute those plans,"" the statement said. ""DHS will also increase personnel and resources as needed, and has already redeployed more than 600 additional law enforcement officers to the border.""

Meanwhile, the number of migrants encountered at the southern border has remained at highs not seen in decades. There were more than 234,000 migrant encounters in April, compared to 178,000 in April 2021 and just 17,106 in April 2020.

The family of a Black Lives Matter protester who was shot and killed by an Army servicemember driving for Uber in Texas during a demonstration is suing him and the ride-share company.

Garrett Foster's family filed a lawsuit against Sgt. Daniel Perry, 35, on Wednesday in Travis County state District Court.

The lawsuit states that Perry, who was stationed in Fort Hood at the time of the July 25, 2020 shooting in downtown Austin, was a ""dangerous, ticking time-bomb"" and that he had posted online about shooting protesters, Fox Austin reported.

Perry was driving for Uber when he shot Foster, who allegedly approached the vehicle with a rifle amid a protest march in the area. Perry fired several shots at Foster with a handgun. Foster, a 28-year-old Air Force veteran, later died at a hospital.

The Austin Police Department determined the shooting was justified but a grand jury indicted Perry on murder charges, which are still pending. He has stated he acted in self-defense.

The shooting came amid massive nationwide protests featuring Black Lives Matter groups. Some of the demonstrations devolved into riots, looting and even killings,

At the time of the shooting, Perry was stationed in Fort Hood, about an hour north of Austin, and was driving for Uber to make some extra money. A spokesperson for Uber declined to comment to Fox News, citing pending litigation.

The United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have directed Russian President Vladimir Putin to remove his ""mountain of corpses,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday.

""They abandoned their military,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet. ""They were dying, but they didn't care. Recently I was told that they are only now thinking about taking the corpses.

""When the war started…they used to pretend that there were no corpses,"" he continued. ""The UN and the Red Cross said – take these bags away. Mountains of corpses of their military.""

UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY PUSHES FOR NEW SECURITY AGREEMENTS WITHOUT RUSSIA, APART FROM PEACE TALKS

Moscow has long relied on its propaganda machine to fuel support for its conflict in Ukraine and Putin has refused to declare open war on Kyiv, instead calling it a ""special military operation.""

Reports surfaced early in the invasion that Russia was potentially relying on a ""mobile crematorium"" to dispose of dead soldiers to help cover the evidence of mounting causalities.

The Pentagon has assessed that Russia is behind schedule in eastern Ukraine, where it intends to gain ""full control.""

But press secretary John Kirby said Friday that the U.S. has assessed that Russian forces are still making ""incremental gains"" in the Donbas and a senior U.S. defense official told reporters this week the U.S. believes Moscow is making some headway in the Black Sea as well.

""The Russians are still well behind where we believe they wanted to be when they started this revitalized effort in the eastern part of the country,"" Kirby said from the Pentagon. ""And while they have made, and we have been very honest about this, they have made some incremental progress in the Donbas. It is incremental, it is slow, it's uneven, and the Ukrainians continue to push back.""

UKRAINE MORALE IS 'HUGE' BOOST IN WAR WITH RUSSIA, NATO MILITARY CHIEFS SAY

Zelenskyy said Ukrainians are fighting to protect their independence and championed that 700,000 Ukrainians are fighting against Russian forces across the war-torn nation.

The Ukrainian president said he signed a decree in early 2022 to add 100,000 additional troops to its fighting force by next year, but warned he is not sure that this will be enough to take on the entire might of Russia.

Western defense officials have argued Russia does not appear to have properly planned for its major offensive against Ukraine, and Zelenskyy said Saturday his nation had been bracing for an attack since September 2021 as Russia started to amass troops along its southern border.

But Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is fighting more than just Russia and has Belarus to contend with as it has backed Putin's deadly campaign.

744,Hillary Clinton was the mastermind behind the Trump-Russia collusion hoax and may never face justice,Gregg Jarrett,"

The stunning revelation that lawyers for the Hillary Clinton campaign paid a computer technology company to surveil a sitting president, Donald Trump, shows that more than half a dozen crimes may have been committed to advance the false accusation that he colluded with Russia.

Some background is in order. After a 22-month probe, Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of a criminal collusion conspiracy because none ever existed. U.S. Attorney John Durham was then tasked to investigate how the odious lie arose and whether crimes were perpetrated to accomplish it.

THE DURHAM INVESTIGATION HAS ENTERED A NEW PHASE AND 2 GLARING QUESTIONS STAND OUT

Later elevated to special counsel status, Durham has indicted three people so far as he continues to doggedly pursue his investigation of wrongdoing by others.

In a recent federal court filing, he disclosed that Clinton campaign lawyers hired a tech company to ""infiltrate"" computer servers housed in Trump Tower, and later, the White House.

As first reported by Fox News, the goal was to generate an ""inference"" or ""narrative"" that Trump was colluding with Russia and then feed the phony information to the FBI to trigger an investigation of him.

The methods behind the brazen smear were remarkably devious. The tech outfit exploited its access to non-public and proprietary internet data on servers at Trump Tower and the White House, according to Durham.

It was equivalent of breaking into a computer except the technicians had special access since the company was performing what's called ""resolution services"" on those highly sensitive accounts.

The cyber sleuths then covertly penetrated the servers without authorization. Once inside, they commandeered innocuous information and peddled it as nefarious back-channel communications between Trump and a Kremlin-linked financial institution called Alfa Bank.

It was insinuated that Trump and his associates were secretly communicating with Russia.

Naturally, the media was tipped off and went full-throttle with wild claims that Trump was a Russian asset.

In reality, much of the tech company's pilfered information turned out to be routine Internet traffic such as computer-generated and automated advertising that came from a mass marketing email company that located its server in Trump Tower.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN LAWYER SUSSMANN ASKS COURT TO 'STRIKE' DURHAM'S 'FACTUAL BACKGROUND' FROM LATEST FILING

Shockingly, the surreptitious intrusions continued when the new president moved into the White House. But no evidence of Russian collusion was discovered because it was, after all, a cunning hoax conjured up by Hillary and her acolytes.

Hillary had others do her dirty work for her and maintained a distance separated through an elaborate chain of people. It was akin to a money laundering scheme, except dirty information was being washed.

This brings us to the present. Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussman has been criminally charged with lying to the FBI about the Alfa Bank fiction.

In a court filing last Friday, Durham offered the appalling new details of how Trump was the victim of an insidious secret surveillance operation at the hands of his political opponent in the 2016 presidential election. More indictments could be forthcoming for a variety of felonious conduct.

It is a crime to provide a law enforcement agency such as the FBI with knowingly false information. Specific charges might include the making of false statements, as well as fraud. If two or more people were involved, it would constitute a conspiracy to defraud the government under 18 USC 371. Depending on how the fabricated information was communicated, charges of wire fraud and mail fraud could be added.

The activity described by Durham also bears close resemblance to the crime of computer fraud and abuse under 18 USC 1030. Then there are the racketeering statutes to be considered. The Clinton secret surveillance ring sounds very much like a criminal enterprise engaged in an illegal scheme involving fraud and obstruction of justice.

As with any well organized criminal exercise, it is exceedingly difficult to nab the person at the top. Hillary Clinton is no different. She carried out her machinations in smart and clever ways. She had others do her dirty work for her and maintained a distance separated through an elaborate chain of people. It was akin to a money laundering scheme, except dirty information was being washed.

Unless people in the chain break their silence and implicate Hillary, she will likely escape culpability.

Evidence of her role has slowly emerged from declassified records. It was July 26, 2016, when Clinton personally approved the plot to vilify Trump with the bogus collusion claims, according to CIA documents. The genesis of the smear came from Hillary herself as a strategy to distract from her own email scandal.

Two days later, President Obama was alerted but appears to have done nothing except keep the matter concealed. Intelligence officials then sent an investigative referral on Clinton to then-FBI Director James Comey and his deputy, Peter Strzok. Predictably, it was buried.

Make no mistake --it was Clinton who invented the elaborate collusion hoax, financed it, and directed the process by which it was circulated to the media and the FBI. Her false claims were then disseminated by a cadre of cronies and dirty-tricksters working secretly in the shadows.

""Everybody should be concerned about [it],"" Biden said in South Korea, while speaking with a group of reporters before he boarded Air Force One for Japan, Reuters reported.

The president’s remarks come as numerous outbreaks of monkeypox were reported in Africa, followed by other reported cases in Europe and the U.S.

""We’re working on it, hard to figure out what we do,"" added Biden.

AFRICAN SCIENTISTS BAFFLED BY MONKEYPOX CASES IN EUROPE, US

While there are at least 80 confirmed cases of the disease worldwide and another 50 suspected cases, the U.S. has only confirmed a pair of cases after a man in Massachusetts was diagnosed with the disease. Another man in New York City also tested positive for monkeypox.

Cases have been reported in Britain, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United States, Sweden, and Canada, all by individuals who reportedly had no travel history with Africa. France, Germany, Belgium, and Australia also reported confirmed cases this week.

While no monkeypox-related deaths have been reported, the worldwide phenomenon has baffled medical experts.

""I’m stunned by this. Every day I wake up and there are more countries infected,"" said Oyewale Tomori, a virologist and World Health Organization advisory board member.

UK CONFIRMS MORE CASES OF MONKEYPOX

""This is not the kind of spread we’ve seen in West Africa, so there may be something new happening in the West,"" he added.

Christian Happi, director of the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases, similarly said he’s ""never seen anything like what's happening in Europe.""

According to WHO estimates, monkeypox could be fatal for up to one-in-ten people, though its similarity to the smallpox virus allows smallpox vaccinations to provide some protection.

756,Kim Wall's gruesome death detailed in Peter Madsen murder trial: A timeline,Jennifer Earl,"

It's one of the most gruesome murder cases Denmark — maybe even the world — has ever seen: journalist Kim Wall's body found in pieces sprawled across an ocean bed.

Danish inventor Peter Madsen, who Wall was interviewing for a story about his homemade submarine in Copenhagen, was charged with her murder. Madsen has maintained his innocence since his arrest on Aug. 11, hours after Wall was reported missing.

""We found a bag with Kim Wall's clothing; shirt, skirt, socks and shoes, and also a knife and lead pieces weighing them down,"" Copenhagen police investigator Jens Moeller Jensen said at the time. ""Around noon we found a leg, then another leg, and shortly thereafter we found a head, also in a bag weighted down by several metal pieces.""

Madsen, 47, pleaded not guilty in Wall's death, maintaining that it was an accident. During his trial on March 8, he claimed she was inside the submarine and died of carbon monoxide poisoning while he was on deck. He admitted cutting her up before he ""buried her at sea.""

""I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead,"" he told the court, according to BBC News.

Madsen was charged with murder, dismemberment and indecent handling of a corpse. He was sentenced in April 2018 to life in prison.

Here's a timeline of events that occurred since Wall stepped foot on Madsen's sub.

April 25, 2018

Madsen is sentenced to life in prison for the murder and dismemberment of Wall. Madsen said he will appeal the murder conviction and life sentence.

April 23, 2018

A prosecutor details grisly parts of Wall's death in the final day of Madsen's trial, claiming the journalist may have been tied with her own stockings before Madsen ""impaled her"" in what he described as a sexual motive.

Madsen's lawyer called it ""a horror story ... but the story is not based on facts. It is based on undocumented claims.""

The prosecutor is asking that Madsen be given life in prison — 16 years in Denmark, which could be extended if necessary. Meanwhile, Madsen's attorney is asking for 6 months in prison for cutting up Wall's body.

March 21, 2018

After a two-week hiatus, Madsen's murder trial resumes.

Madsen, who is accused of either cutting Kim Wall's throat or strangling her on his submarine, took the stand at the Copenhagen City Court.

Again, Madsen denied killing Wall, asserting to prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen he's ""never been violent to any human being — and no dead human being either.""

Madsen eventually admitted to stabbing Wall after prosecutors revealed multiple stab wounds were found on the recovered body parts. The inventor said he used a sharpened screwdriver to stab the body, insisting they were only done to make sure the parts would sink.

""I put some punctures in the body parts because I didn’t want them to be inflated by gases,” Madsen said, according to the Telegraph. “There is nothing sexual in the fact that the stab holes were in her vagina. I understand why you might think there was, but there was nothing sexual in it for me.”

Madsen said he stabbed her after taking her clothes off, beheading her and placing the head in a plastic bag.



""I wanted to make sure there were no traces in Nautilus, so yes. I am in a condition where I want this accident to go away,"" Madsen said.

March 8, 2018

Madsen's murder trial begins in Copenhagen City Court, where he faces two judges and two jurors.

Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen kicked off the 12-day trial by reading the charges against Madsen.

He detailed how Wall's body parts were discovered. And said a psychiatric report concluded Madsen was intelligent ""with psychopathic tendencies"" who has ""no empathy or feelings of guilt.""

Madsen himself later took the stand, once again denying that he murdered Wall, according to Sky News.

""What I will tell you today is a grim story that I did not want to tell anyone ever,"" he said.

Jan. 16, 2018

Madsen is formally charged with murder, dismemberment and indecent handling of a corpse. He is also charged with having sexual relations with Wall of a ""particularly dangerous nature.""

Nov. 29, 2017

Divers find Wall's right arm in the sea south of the Danish capital.

Nov. 22, 2017

Divers find Wall's left arm in the sea.



Oct. 7, 2017

Police say they have found a head, two legs and clothes in plastic bags a day earlier. Dental records help identify Wall.

Oct. 4, 2017

Police say they found 15 stab wounds on Wall's torso. They also find videos of women being tortured, decapitated and killed on Madsen's computer. The videos are not produced by Madsen.

Oct. 3, 2017

A prosecutor says in court that Madsen had a computer containing video of the torture and killing of women.

""We think it's video recordings of true killing of women,"" Buch-Jepsen said, according to a translation in The Ekstra Bladet newspaper, adding some of the videos containing killings done by ""decapitation and burning.""

A judge later ruled Madsen will continue to sit behind bars until Oct. 31 as police continue to investigate Wall's death.

Sept. 5, 2017

Madsen claims at a pre-trial hearing that Wall was hit in the head by a 155-pound hatch on the submarine and died from an open skull fracture. He later changes his story when Wall's head is found with no skull fractures.

The court changes the charge against Madsen to manslaughter.

Aug. 25, 2017

Danish police file another charge against Madsen In addition to a preliminary manslaughter charge in Wall's death, the inventor also faces a charge of indecent handling of a corpse, chief investigator Jens Moeller Jensen announces.

Aug. 23, 2017

Danish police say the headless torso that washed ashore matches the DNA of Wall.

Aug. 21, 2017

Wall's naked, headless body is first spotted by a cyclist riding along Amager Island in Copenhagen, Wired reports.

Aug. 15, 2017

Swedish police assist Danish officials with their search for Wall.

Aug. 14, 2017

Danish investigators say the sinking of Welden's submarine was a “deliberate act.""

Aug. 13, 2017

Madsen's submarine is raised and put onto land in Copenhagen.

Aug. 12, 2017

Madsen appears in court for a pre-trial custody hearing. He said her death was an ""accident,"" explaining that a hatch knocked her in the head. He was ordered held for 24 days.

Aug. 11, 2017

Madsen is rescued by a private motorboat Friday morning in Denmark’s Koge Bay after his submarine sank. He tells police he dropped Wall off before the vessel went down, but she was later reported missing by her boyfriend, which raised suspicion.

Madsen is later detained on involuntary manslaughter charges by Danish police in Wall's death.

Aug. 10, 2017

Wall skipped her own goodbye party — a celebration of her and her boyfriend, Ole Stobbe's move to Beijing — to meet Madsen aboard his 55-foot UC3 Nautilus submarine with plans to interview him for a story.

Wall texted Stobbe a picture of herself, possibly the last one ever taken, smiling aboard the sub and standing alongside Madsen, whose back is turned.

A Washington state liberal activist was convicted in a federal terrorism case on Thursday for her role in a ""shunt"" attack on the BNSF Railroad.

Last November, leftist activist Ellen Reiche, 28, was one of two people charged in the terrorist attack seeking to derail trains in the coastal city of Bellingham.

Reiche was convicted on Thursday for the shunt attack and is facing up to two decades in prison. Samantha Brooks, Reiche’s co-conspirator, pleaded guilty to the charges in July.

WOMEN LINKED WITH ANARCHIST GROUP CHARGED WITH TERRORIST ATTACK ON TRAIN TRACKS NORTH OF SEATTLE

Reiche and Brooks, 24, were hit with terrorism charges for placing a ""shunt"" on railroad tracks right before a crude oil-shuttling train was scheduled to travel the tracks.

A shunt is a device that disrupts train signals and safety measures, including crossing guardrails, and can lead to deadly, disastrous consequences, the Post Millenial reported .

The pair were caught trespassing in surveillance video and detained by Whatcom sheriff’s deputies, who discovered the shunt in the tracks and saw that Reiche was carrying a paper bag containing gloves, a drill, magnetic adhesive, and other items that would be used to install a shunt.

The magnets in the shunt would have interfered with the signals from the system indicating an incoming train, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Sok Jiang remarking to the jury in closing arguments that the shunt ""disrupted the signal system designed to stop trains from crashing into each other or crashing into cars.""

""A car driving through the intersection (near the shunt) would not have warning that a train was coming,"" the U.S. attorney continued.

Since January of last year, 41 shunts have been placed on the Bellingham tracks, with the BNSF police and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force working together on the case.

The ""One China policy"" refers to the U.S. recognition of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, but only acknowledges, without endorsing, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin expressed ""strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition"" to Biden's comments: ""China has no room for compromise or concessions on issues involving China’s core interests such as sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin considers Ukraine a part of historic Russia, and Xi considers Taiwan a part of China.

CHINA LAUNCHES MILITARY EXERCISES IN SOUTH CHINA SEA AS BIDEN VISITS ASIA

In October, Biden said the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China attacks. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson responded by saying, ""No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination and capability of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China has no room for compromise.""

China launched military exercises in the disputed South China Sea as Biden's trip to East Asia began Friday.

Asia expert Gordon Chang, author of ‘The Great US-China Tech War,"" said the Biden administration is trying to backtrack previous indications that America fears China by proceeding with Taiwan discussions in the face of public warnings from Chinese officials. Chang told ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Sunday that China's recent military drill is ""connected"" to Biden's Asia visit because his joint statement with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol mentioned Taiwan directly.

""They are connected because, before Biden touched down in South Korea – the first stop on the trip – the Chinese publicly warned him not to talk about Taiwan and so there was the joint statement between President Biden and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea, which specifically mentions Taiwan,"" Chang said. ""There are going to be a lot of Taiwan discussions in Japan, the second and last stop on this trip - and so really what the United States was saying to Beijing is, ""'I'm not afraid of you anymore.'""

""The reason the administration has to do that is because, in the last couple of weeks, the Biden team has done things that made it look like it was intimidated by China, which is the reason why the Chinese were very aggressive before the trip, because they thought they had Biden on the run,"" Chang added.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended Chinese President Xi Jinping's timetable to invade Taiwan, according to documents purportedly written by a Russian intelligence analyst in one of Moscow's security agencies.

""Xi Jinping was at least considering taking over Taiwan in the fall – he needs his own little victory to get re-elected for a third term – there the struggle within the elite is colossal,"" an agent in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor agency to the KGB, allegedly wrote on March 9.

""Now, after the Ukrainian events, this window of opportunity has been closed to him, which gives the United States the opportunity to both blackmail Xi and negotiate with its competitors on favorable terms,"" the FSB agent added.

760,Accused Buffalo mass shooter Payton Gendron said he 'wanted to commit murder-suicide' in 2021 threat: FBI,Stephanie Pagones,"

CONKLIN, N.Y. – New details have emerged regarding the alleged threat that accused Buffalo mass shooter Payton Gendron made in June 2021, leading the teenager to undergo a required mental health evaluation at a local hospital.

Payton Gendron, now 18, said he wanted ""to commit a murder-suicide"" in June 2021, prompting New York State Police to respond to the local high school and take the teen into custody, said Stephen Belongia, special agent-in-charge of the FBI’s Buffalo Field Office.

Belongia provided the details during a joint FBI-DHS National Partner Call on Monday afternoon. FBI Director Christopher Wray, United States Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Associate Attorney General for the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Kristen Clarke and police and sheriff’s department officials from Buffalo also participated in Monday’s call.

""In June 2021, New York State Police in Binghamton, New York, received a call from the assistant principal of the local high school regarding the alleged killer,"" Belongia explained. ""This principal reported the alleged killer responded to a question about post-graduation plans by stating he wanted to commit a murder suicide. New York State Police took him into custody under New York mental health laws and transported him to the hospital for evaluation.""

On Sunday, a spokesperson for the New York State said troopers responded to Susquehanna High School in Conklin, N.Y., in June 2021 ""to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student had made a threatening statement."" The spokesperson did not identify the subject by name, but said there was no target associated with the threat.

Speaking to reporters that same day, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said state police responded, investigated and ""felt it was appropriate at that time to have that individual brought in for a mental health evaluation.""

Gendron allegedly remained hospitalized for one-and-a-half days.

""State police did their job to the fullest that they could at that time,"" Gramaglia went on. He later added: ""He was evaluated, and then he was released. As far as when we say 'On the radar,' there was nothing picked up on the state police intelligence, nothing that was picked up on the FBI intelligence. Nobody called in. Nobody called any complaints.""

On Sunday, Susquehanna Valley Central School District Superintendent Roland Doig wrote in a statement that school staff members were ""unspeakably saddened by the news of the shooting in Buffalo.""

""Our thoughts remain wit the victims and all of the families impacted by this tragedy,"" he wrote. ""While law enforcement continues their investigation, we are providing mental health services and counselors for students and staff that need support.""

Gendron, who is White, pulled up to the Tops grocery store around 2:30 p.m. Saturday and immediately began firing off shots – wounding four people in front of the market before making his way inside, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said. Three of the four victims died.

Once inside, he exchanged fire with store security guard Aaron Salter, who was a retired police officer, officials have said. Salter fired several rounds at Gendron before the suspect fatally shot him, Gramaglia said.

Gendron then allegedly made his way around the store shooting several other victims. When confronted by police, Gendron placed the rifle to his neck before dropping the weapon and surrendering, the police chief said.

Ten people were shot and killed. Three other people were injured.

Eleven of the victims were Black individuals, officials have said.

Officials have said the suspect live-streamed a portion of the shooting on social media platform Twitch. A Twitch spokesperson said the stream was suspended within two minutes. Gendron also allegedly detailed his plans in an extensive, hate-filled manifesto.

So far, investigators have found that Gendron was in possession of ""three weapons. There were two in the car and one in his possession,"" Gramaglia said.

761,Media Matters boss paid former partner $850G 'blackmail' settlement,Jana Winter,"

prev Image 2 of 2

Media Matters chief David Brock paid a former domestic partner $850,000 after being threatened with damaging information involving the organization’s donors and the IRS – a deal that Brock later characterized as a blackmail payment, according to legal documents obtained by FoxNews.com.

In an acrimonious lawsuit settled at the end of last year, Brock accused William Grey of making repeated threats to expose him to the ""scorn or ridicule of his employees, donors and the press in demanding money and property."" Brock claimed in legal papers that he sold a Rehoboth Beach, Del., home he once shared with Grey in order to meet Grey’s demands, which he called ""blackmail"" in the lawsuit.

Brock, 49, heads the non-profit Media Matters for America, which bills itself as a watchdog of the conservative media but has recently come under fire for allegedly coordinating with Democrats in what could be a violation of its tax-exempt status.

Brock’s bitter legal battle with Grey, who is described in a Sept. 14, 2010, police report obtained by FoxNews.com as his domestic partner of more than 10 years, began after Brock began dating Washington, D.C., restaurant impresario James Alefantis about five years ago. For the next three years, Brock and Grey traded angry accusations, which were documented in the police report and were the foundation of a pitched legal battle replete with charges of blackmail, theft and financial malfeasance.

Read the police report detailing the lawsuit

Alefantis was also named as a defendant in Grey's lawsuit.

In his response to Brock's lawsuit, Grey ""denies that he committed any ""acts of blackmail.""""

Grey threatened to go public about Brock and Media Matters' finances after he accused Brock in a civil suit filed in Washington of taking $170,000 in possessions, including an $8,000 Louis Vuitton suit bag, paintings, a rug, a chandelier, a painted bust of a Roman soldier and a pair of carved wooden chairs upholstered with purple fabric. Those possessions were displayed in the Washington townhouse where the couple entertained liberal movers and shakers in happier times.

Brock took Grey’s threats seriously and called police in 2010. In the police report, filed by Metropolitan Police as a stalking incident, Brock accused Grey, also 49, of attempting to blackmail him with a series of emails threatening to ""release specific derogatory information about [Brock] and his organization to the press and donors that would be embarrassing to him and cause harm to the organization …""

Some of those emails came out as the lawsuit, filed by Grey on Jan. 28, 2011, wound its way through Superior Court of the District of Columbia last year.

Read the complete lawsuit filed by William Grey

""Please finish this today so I don’t have to waste my time emailing anyone – Biden, Coulter, Carlson, Huffington, Drudge, Ingraham,"" Grey wrote in a 2008 email.

Nearly two years later, Grey accused Brock of ""financial malfeasance"" and threatened to undermine Brock’s fundraising efforts.

""Next step is I contact all your donors and the IRS,"" Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. ""This is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.""

Brock said in court papers that he paid Grey ""under duress.""

On March 8, 2011, Brock filed his own suit against Grey for more than $4 million, demanding Grey return the $850,000, plus pay millions more in punitive damages. The two settled two months ago under terms that remain confidential.

Read the complete counterclaim filed by David Brock

Paying off Grey may not have been easy for Brock, even with his salary of nearly $300,000 at Media Matters. Records show Brock had pulled massive amounts of equity from the six-bedroom Rehoboth Beach house as its value skyrocketed during the real estate bubble.

Sussex County property records show he took out a $273,000 mortgage to buy the pale yellow colonial and carriage house for $606,666 in 1995. As the converted inn, built in 1793, continued to rise in value, Brock refinanced his loan on at least two occasions. Records show he had a $1.44 million mortgage on the property, as well as two more loans against the home totaling just over $500,000.

Brock received $1,587,500 for the home on May 25, 2010, in a sale to McLean, Va.-based Vardell Realty Investments. It could not be determined how much Brock still owed on the $1.44 million mortgage, or how much he netted from the sale, if any.

Records indicate that Brock had paid off the two smaller loans at the time of the sale.

Within a year of selling the house, Brock apparently had second thoughts about paying off Grey. In the civil suit, Brock accused Grey of three counts of blackmail, citing a statute that defines blackmail as threatening ""to expose a secret or publicize a fact, whether true or false, tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule, to impair the reputation of any person.""

He countersued to get his $850,000 back, plus $500,000 for each of three counts of alleged blackmail, and another $2 million in compensatory damages based in part on what Brock’s lawyers called abuse of the judicial system and legal fees.

Grey, who relocated to Massachusetts, declined to comment when contacted by FoxNews.com. Brock and Alefantis remain in Washington, where Brock has released a new book attacking Fox News. He is also under scrutiny from several members of Congress amid reports Media Matters for America is in possible violation of IRS laws governing nonprofits.

The Rehoboth Beach home was torn down months after Brock sold it, amid much community opposition, so the buyer could divide the parcel and build two homes. It remains a vacant lot.

762,"Sussmann trial: MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC ignore testimony that Clinton OK’d leaking of Trump-Russian allegations",Brian Flood,"

MSNBC, ABC News, NBC News and CBS News have nearly completely ignored Friday’s bombshell testimony in which former Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook testified Clinton approved the dissemination of materials to the media alleging a secret communications channel between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank, despite campaign officials not being ""totally confident"" in the legitimacy of the data.

""Left-wing media outlets shout from the rooftops that disinformation matters and is a threat to democracy. Unless, of course, it makes Democrats or the press look bad,"" radio host Jason Rantz told Fox News Digital.

The mainstream media has largely avoided covering the trial of ex-Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who has been charged with making a false statement to the FBI. He told former FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016 that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and attended a meeting where he presented data and white papers allegedly demonstrating a backchannel between the Trump Organization and the Kremlin-tied Alfa Bank.

SPECIAL COUNSEL JOHN DURHAM'S PROSECUTION OF MICHAEL SUSSMANN: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

MSNBC, ABC News, NBC News and CBS News have almost entirely ignored the trial since it began on May 15 and continued the blackout after Friday’s stunning revelation.

A transcript search for Monday and Tuesday morning also found no coverage on the four outlets' televised programs. CBSN, the CBS News streaming service, covered the trial in a news package on Monday night and delved into the revelations from Mook.

Baker previously testified that the bureau investigated the data alleging a Trump connection to the Kremlin-linked bank, and found ""there was nothing there."" Mook was called to the stand by Sussmann’s defense, and during cross-examination he was asked about the campaign’s understanding of the Alfa Bank allegations against Trump and whether they planned to release the data to the media.

Mook said the campaign was not totally confident in the legitimacy of the data but eventually admitted Clinton herself approved ""the dissemination"" of the information to the media.

""She agreed,"" Mook testified. ""All I remember is that she agreed with the decision.""

MSNBC, ABC News, NBC News and CBS News didn’t report the news on air through Sunday night, according to a search of transcripts. None of the networks have mentioned the names ""Mook"" or ""Sussmann"" since the testimony.

HILLARY CLINTON APPROVED DISSEMINATION OF TRUMP-RUSSIAN BANK ALLEGATIONS TO MEDIA, CAMPAIGN MANAGER TESTIFIES

Rantz called it ""pathetic"" that mainstream news organizations are so hypocritical. He feels ignoring Mook’s testimony isn’t the first time the media botched the story, as it liberal news outlets shouldn’t have reported what Clinton’s team provided ahead of the 2016 election in the first place.

""They didn't even bother to dig deep into the claims by campaign officials; they just ran with them,"" Rantz continued. ""It was one of many examples of press release journalism -- just taking what they're told by the campaigns they support. How utterly pathetic.""

Many of the outlets that have ignored the Sussmann trial spent years pushing the Russian collusion narrative before it fell apart. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation concluded there was no evidence of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election. Prior to Mueller declaring there was no proof of collusion, MSNBC and other outlets spent years hyping it up and painting Trump as being compromised by Russia.

DePauw University professor Jeffrey McCall said this is ""a classic case of journalism of omission.""

MICHAEL SUSSMANN TRIAL: ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC IGNORE CASE AT CENTER OF TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE

""This is an intentional ignoring of a legitimate news matter in order to support the ideological drift of the editors and producers. The establishment media are generally unwilling to report on the Durham probe and current legal developments because to do so would necessarily acknowledge the journalistic malpractice committed for two years while pushing the misguided Russia collusion narrative,"" McCall told Fox News Digital.

Observers have noticed the latest developments go uncovered, too.

""The Clinton campaign fabricated a completely false story about Trump having a secret server with a Russian bank,"" journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted. ""When major news outlets spread outright lies – not just one day, but repeatedly affirming them – they just stay silent and pretend it never happened when the proof emerges they lied.""

Billionaire Elon Musk chimed in, writing ""bet most people still don’t know that a Clinton campaign lawyer, using campaign funds, created an elaborate hoax about Trump and Russia.""

""The HIllary Clinton campaign and DNC, with her approval, conducted a disinformation operation to falsely taint another candidate as having illicit ties to Russia, in one of the dirtiest political tricks in modern history. Worse than that, the disinformation operation froze an incoming administration for several years and provided pretext for a 'Resistance' movement that refused to accept the outcome of the election,"" Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson told Fox News Digital.

""This should be the biggest media story of the century, but most of the mainstream liberal media is staying away because they were complicit,"" Jacobson continued. ""Hillary Clinton's fraudulent Russia narrative was parroted endlessly on major networks and cable news, and throughout digital media.""

772,"Critics slam MSNBC host’s claim that kids belong to community, not parents",Hollie Mckay,"

Parents and media critics were aghast after a host for MSNBC called for collective care of a community's children instead of parents taking care of their kids themselves.

MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry recorded a commercial for the network in which she stated that children do not belong to their parents, but are instead the responsibility of the members of their community.

“We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had kind of a private notion of children. Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility. We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children,” she says in a spot for the network’s “Lean Forward” campaign. “So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.”

Harris-Perry’s views ignited a firestorm of anger and disbelief.

“The notion that children belong to a state government rather than their own flesh and blood is the most disturbing statement made in recent political times. Melissa Harris-Perry is dead wrong. It’s unfathomable that any true American could make such a pretentious and naively ill statement,” media communications expert, and parent, Angie Olszewski told FOX411’s Pop Tarts column. “The government can’t properly run their own budgets schools and public systems. Why would anybody think they could rear children?”

The Media Research Center’s Director of Media Analysis, Tim Graham, called the MSNBC spot ""frightening.”

“It's bad enough that ‘Lean Forward’ already sounds like an ad for Mao's Little Red Book, then to have your network's hosts talk about your children being part of the Collective is just spooky,” he said. “I think most parents disappoint MSNBC with their traditional beliefs that their children are theirs to love and raise as they feel is best. They don't want to surrender their parental rights to the ‘village.’ It's this same contempt for education beginning in the home that spurs many parents into home-schooling.”

Political pundit Glenn Beck condemned the clip during his radio show Monday, calling it an almost “parody of reality so far beyond what we have ever thought as a nation.” He also said there were plenty of people enamored by the MSNBC host’s theory, who would gladly “hand over” parenting responsibilities.

However, there are also those who argue that Harris-Perry’s comments are a step in the right direction when it comes to tackling the issue of improving education.

“I totally agree that ‘it takes a village.’ Although parents have the greatest influence on their children, society and its messages are powerful. It is up to us as educators and concerned community members to do what we can to make sure those messages are the ones we want our children to hear,” explained school administrator and founder of ParentingGirls.com, Dr. Janet R.Wojtalik. “Unfortunately not all of our families have the 'know how' or the resources to do what is best for their children. They need support.”

D.C.-based political lawyer Margaret Cone concurred, noting that her own family – like most at her own childhood school – actively participated in school activities.

“I was very close to the parents of my childhood friends. They watched out for me,” she continued. “It is society’s responsibility to ensure that the next generation is equipped to handle the ever-changing world. Educating our children is a responsibility that has been grossly ignored to our detriment.”

The clip has received almost half a million YouTube views since it was posted last week, and has drawn quite a mixed bag of responses.

782,Texas shooting: Uvalde mayor says local police did not mislead anyone about law enforcement response,Posted Paul Best,"""The Governor and I were both livid at the information initially given to Texas DPS,"" Patrick told Fox News Digital on Monday evening. ""I think the Mayor has done an excellent job at a very difficult time and my focus continues to be on the families.""

Lt. Gov. Patrick said Monday that his ""goal at this time is to support Mayor McLaughlin and the citizens of Uvalde.""

""Local law enforcement has not made any public comments about the specifics of the investigation into the incident or [misled] anyone,"" McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to Fox News Digital on Monday. ""Statements by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick that he was ‘not told the truth’ are not true.""

The mayor said Monday that local law enforcement has not misled Patrick or any other officials.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Fox News on Saturday that officials were initially ""not told the truth"" and that the choice to wait was a ""bad decision, and that decision cost lives.""

Officials initially praised the police response to the tragedy, but backtracked when new details came to light, including that law enforcement waited up to an hour to breach a classroom and kill the suspect.

Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin is defending local law enforcement in the wake of last week's school shooting that left 19 children and two adults dead, saying that the Texas Rangers are leading the investigation and local police have not misled anyone.

Other fundraising campaigns have been created for Eva Mireles, the other teacher killed Tuesday, as well as many of the students and their families.

""Joe died of a broken heart and losing the love of his life of more than 25 years was too much to bear,"" the campaign added.

Her husband, Joe Garcia, died just days after the tragic shooting and the funds will go to help their four surviving children.

“She would literally do anything for anybody,” the donation page said. “She loved her classroom kids and died trying to protect them.”

Garcia was one of two teachers killed last Tuesday, that also left 19 children dead.

Nearly 50,000 donators have contributed over $2.7 million to a GoFundMe campaign for Irma Garcia, the 4th-grade teacher who bravely saved students during a mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.

The U.S. Justice Department announced they are investigating the police response to the school shooting.

“He dropped the ball maybe because he did not have enough experience. Who knows? People are very angry,"" said Maria Gonzalez, who knew Arredondo as a boy.

Arredondo, who grew up in Uvalde and graduated from high school in the city, took the head police job at the school district in 2020.

Arredondo, 50, instructed officers not to breach a classroom at Robb Elementary School sooner, as he did not believe children were still at risk — a decision the director of state police later said was ""wrong.""

At the center of the blame is Pete Arredondo, the school district's homegrown police chief who was the commander at the scene for Tuesday's mass shooting.

“You sign up to respond to those kinds of situations” said Juan Torres, an Uvalde resident and U.S. Army veteran. “If you are scared, then don’t be a police officer. Go flip burgers.”

The excruciating delay is a ghastly detail that frustrates the grieving Uvalde community and several of the residents want the officers who made the decision held accountable.

Despite several calls for emergency assistance from within Robb Elementary School, law enforcement officers waited outside for over 70 minutes while suspected gunman Salvador Ramos gunned down 19 children and two teachers in a classroom.

Eleven more funerals are planned later this week, which will include a service for teacher Irma Garcia.

A gathering for 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza was held at Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home Monday while another visitation for 10-year-old Maite Rodriguez was at the small town's other funeral home.

This week was supposed to kick off the summer vacation for Robb Elementary School students in Uvalde, Texas, but following a mass shooting last week, many people in the community are instead spending their week attending the funeral services for the 21 victims.

Could Israeli school security methods serve as model for US schools? JERUSALEM, Israel – Shooting attacks on schools in Israel are rare and the Jewish state’s preventive security measures could be a helpful starting point for improved school security in the U.S. There have been six terrorist attacks on Israeli schools since 1974. That low figure can be explained by the multiple layers of security Israel employs and the engagement of civil society in aiding the nation's law enforcement. David Hazony, a writer, and commentator on Israeli and American affairs and a father to eleven children, told Fox News Digital that the country ""puts effort into identifying potential assailants through behavioral profiling."" Israel could not prevent attacks if its efforts were based solely on armed security guards at each school, he said. Israel ""invests heavily in monitoring profiles of people,"" Hazony continued.

Loved ones and onlookers outside school urged police to go inside during shooting: 'Go in there!' Witnesses said that loved ones and onlookers anxiously waiting outside Robb Elementary on Tuesday as the gunman was inside shooting teachers and students urged police who were outside the school to go in and try to stop the shooter. Some also suggested they take it upon themselves to try and stop him. Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw said the gunman could have been in the school for 40 minutes to an hour. “Go in there! Go in there!” a woman shouted to officers soon after the shooting happened, witness Juan Carranza, 24, said. He lives across the street from the school. “There were more of them. There was just one of him,” he said. But he said the officers stayed outside. Javier Cazares went to the school after hearing about the shooting because his daughter went to school there. He said he suggested a group of civilians “rush in because the cops aren’t doing anything like they are supposed to. More could have been done. They were unprepared.” His daughter, Jacklyn Cazares, died in the attack. Officials say the shooter “encountered"" a school district security officer outside the school, though there were conflicting reports from authorities on whether the men exchanged gunfire. After running inside, the gunman fired on two arriving Uvalde police officers who were outside the building, said Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Travis Considine. The police officers were injured. He then went inside a classroom and began killing. The gunman wasn’t killed for the better part of an hour until a Border Patrol team tactical unit (Uvalde is near the Mexican border) arrived and shot him. A person who spoke on condition of anonymity said Border Patrol had trouble opening the locked door and a staff member had to get a key. McCraw told reporters that 40 minutes to an hour elapsed from when Ramos opened fire on the school security officer to when the tactical team shot him, though a department spokesman said later that they could not give a solid estimate of how long the gunman was in the school or when he was killed. “The bottom line is law enforcement was there,"" McCraw said. “They did engage immediately. They did contain (Ramos) in the classroom.” The Associated Press contributed to this report. For more on this story: Who are the victims killed at Uvalde elementary school?

Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, are currently in Ukraine, where they visited the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, the first American lawmakers to do so since it reopened last week.

The embassy had shuttered its doors and relocated operations in the days prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

794,"Cold case team says Zodiac Killer ID'd, linking him to another murder",Louis Casiano,"

A team of specialists who investigate cold cases says it has identified the Zodiac Killer, one of America's most prolific serial murderers who terrorized communities in the San Francisco area in the late 1960s with a series of brutal slayings and unsolvable riddles.

The Case Breakers, a team of more than 40 former law enforcement investigators, journalists and military intelligence officers, has tackled other mysteries such as the D.B. Cooper hijacking heist, the disappearance of former labor union boss Jimmy Hoffa and other unsolved cases. The group believes the killer is responsible for a slaying hundreds of miles away that was never linked to him.

The Zodiac Killer has been connected to five murders that occurred in 1968 and 1969 in the San Francisco area. Unlike most serial killers, the Zodiac taunted authorities with complex ciphers in letters sent to newspapers and law enforcement. The slayings have spawned books, movies and documentaries in the years since, and amateur and professional sleuths have pored over the case in an effort to unmask the killer.

In the decades since the first murder, many potential suspects have been investigated.

COLD CASE MURDER OF MASSACHUSETTS TEEN SOLVED WITHOUT DNA TECHNOLOGY, SUSPECT ARRESTED IN GEORGIA

The Case Breakers is now saying it has identified the Zodiac Killer as Gary Francis Poste, who passed away in 2018. The team's years of digging uncovered new forensic evidence and photos from Poste's darkroom. One image features scars on the forehead of Poste that match scars on a sketch of the Zodiac, the team said.

Other clues include deciphering letters sent by the Zodiac that revealed him as the killer, said Jen Bucholtz, a former Army counterintelligence agent who works on cold cases. In one note, the letters of Poste's full name were removed to reveal an alternate message, she told Fox News.

""So you've got to know Gary's full name in order to decipher these anagrams,"" Bucholtz said. ""I just don't think there's any other way anybody would have figured it out.""

The team believes Poste also killed Cheri Jo Bates on Oct. 31, 1966, in Riverside, Calif., hundreds of miles south from the San Francisco area and two years before the first killing linked to the Zodiac occurred. Bates, 18, was found dead in an alleyway on the Riverside City College campus after her father phoned police to report her missing.

LAS VEGAS MAN ARRESTED 47 YEARS AFTER COLD CASE KILLING IF 7-ELEVEN CLERK

The following year, authorities received a handwritten letter that led investigators to believe the killing may be linked to the Zodiac Killer. In 2016, investigators received an anonymous typed letter from someone who admitted to writing the earlier note and said it was a ""sick joke.""

""The author admitted that he was not the Zodiac killer or the killer of Cheri Jo Bates and that he was just looking for attention,"" the police department said.

Investigators later confirmed the author was not involved in the Bates murder, and the Zodiac was never linked to the crime.

""Our Homicide Cold Case Unit has determined the murder of Cheri Jo Bates in 1966 is not related to the Zodiac killer,"" the Riverside Police Department's Homicide Cold Case Unit told Fox News. ""We understand the public interest in these unsolved murders, but all inquiries regarding the Zodiac Killer should be referred to the FBI.""

""The Cheri Jo Bates case remains an open investigation and we do not have any additional details to release at this time,"" the police added.

The Case Breakers believe Bates was Zodiac's sixth victim and have tried getting investigators to compare her DNA to that of Poste, to no avail, the team said. According to a 1975 FBI memo to Riverside police obtained by the team, the agency said Bates was a Zodiac victim.

""The real portion here has everything to do with ego and arrogance,"" Case Breakers team member Bill Proctor, a former police officer who spent 40 years in television news, told Fox News of the Riverside Police Department. ""They're not talking about what they have which means that anybody else who comes to the table might have a reasonable argument that an outside organization's information is as valuable, if not more valuable, than what the police department has already done.""

The team said a series of coincidences connect Bates and Poste: Poste was an Air Force veteran when he received medical check-ups for a gun incident at a hospital located 15 minutes away from the Bates murder scene. A wristwatch with paint splatter on it was collected at the murder scene and is thought to have been worn by the killer.

Poste painted homes for more than four decades, the team said. In addition, detectives found a heel print from a military-style boot, which matched the same style and size of those found in other Zodiac crime scenes and of Poste.

This year, the Riverside Police Department offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the decades-old murder case.

The Zodiac terrorized communities across Northern California in the late 1960s. The killer has been connected to five killings but claimed to have murdered 37 victims. The first of the confirmed Zodiac slayings occurred in December 1968 when a man and woman were shot dead in a car in Benicia, California. On July 4, 1969, another man and woman were shot in Vallejo. He survived.

Later that year, a couple was stabbed near a lake. The man survived despite sustaining multiple stab wounds.

A cab driver was fatally shot in San Francisco that year as well. No one has ever been charged or identified in connection with the slayings. Unlike most serial killers, the Zodiac taunted authorities with complex ciphers and letters.

In 2020, a team of code-breakers cracked a 340-character cipher that was sent to the San Francisco Chronicle by the Zodiac. At the time, the FBI said the Zodiac case remained ongoing.

""I hope you are having lots of fun in trying to catch me. ... I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradise all the sooner because I now have enough slaves to work for me,"" the decrypted message read.

Fox News has reached out to the Vallejo Police Department and the FBI and unsuccessfully tried reaching out to relatives of Poste. The San Francisco Police Department said it was unable to speak about potential suspects in the Zodiac case because it remains an ongoing investigation.

A California woman who lived next door to Poste and his wife told Fox News she believes he's the Zodiac Killer after seeing the evidence collected so far. Gwen, who declined to give her last name, said Poste and his wife babysat her as a child in the 1970s and '80s. He would teach her how to shoot firearms several times a week but was also controlling and abusive toward his wife, she said.

She declined to elaborate further. Poste also became somewhat of a father figure to his son's friends, she said.

""He lived a double life,"" she said. ""As I'm adult thinking back, it all kind of makes sense now. At the time when I was a teenager, I didn't put two and two together until I got older. It hit me full-blown that Gary's the Zodiac.""

Hans Smits told Fox News he spent 10 years hiding a whistleblower who said he escaped a criminal ""posse"" headed by Poste. The man, who The Case Breakers only referred to as Wil, told Smits the posse roamed California's High Sierra region and that he was ""groomed into a killing machine.""

In addition, Wil said he witnessed Poste burying murder weapons in the woods, Smits said.

""They put out several bear caches out there in case something happened,"" Smits said.

Smits said he gave Wil financial, logistical and emotional support over the years and moved him around for nearly 10 years in an effort to keep him safe.

""I'm the one that took him to the FBI office and put him on a train and sent him out of state,"" Smits said.

Another woman named Michelle said she was common-law married to Poste's son. She told Fox News she was a victim of harassment by Poste and his ""posse"" during the relationship that included damaging her car and other incidents.

Despite being dead for three years, some people are mysteriously still loyal to him, said Michelle, who also declined to provide her last name.

795,Texas high school shooting suspect granted bond arrested for violating terms of release,Rebecca Rosenberg,"

A Texas teen accused of opening fire on a classmate at Timberview High School is back behind bars for Christmas after allegedly violating the terms of his bond, according to media reports.

Timothy Simpkins, 18, was busted Thursday after a court-ordered urinalysis returned a positive result for an illicit substance, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

The terms of Simpkins $75,000 bond prohibit the use of drugs and alcohol. Simpkins had earlier sought a judge's permission to attend church on Sundays. The request hadn't yet been ruled on, according to the local newspaper.

Many people criticized Simpkins' release on social media. ""Can't remember a time where a school shooting suspect is released the next day,"" wrote @rachisawake on Twitter.

Simpkins is charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for the Oct. 6 shooting inside the school that injured four.

796,"DC alleged 'sniper' shooter fired more than 200 rounds from fifth floor, set up camera to watch cops: police",Danielle Wallace,"

Washington, D.C., police revealed on Monday that so-called ""sniper"" shooting suspect Raymond Spencer had fired more than 200 rounds from a fifth-floor apartment and set up a camera in the hallway to watch approaching officers before investigators said he killed himself inside a bathroom.

At a press conference on the fourth day since the high-profile shooting, D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee said investigators still know little about the potential motive of the suspect or his financial background, including ""how such a young man"" could afford leases on at least two apartments and expensive firearms.

""We know that an excess of over 200 rounds were fired from this sniper, from this apartment on Van Ness Street,"" D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters Monday. ""We know that he had 800 rounds – un-spent, un-shot rounds – at his disposal inside his location in Van Ness.""

VIDEO OF ‘SNIPER-TYPE’ DC SHOOTING SUSPECT WHO SHOT PEOPLE AT RANDOM BEING ANALYZED: POLICE

""We have an entire city who was terrorized by this case,"" the chief added.

The 23-year-old Spencer is accused of indiscriminately opening fire from a fifth-floor apartment window at approximately 3:18 p.m. Friday, sending a barrage of bullets down onto Van Ness Street.

The shooting happened shortly before the nearby college preparatory Edmund Burke School’s afternoon dismissal. A total of four people were shot, including a 12-year-old girl and a retired police department member. As of Monday, two of the victims remained in critical condition at area hospitals.

""He certainly intended to do what he did. I just don’t know why,"" Contee said. ""Had he waited a few minutes, when there’s dismissal going on, he wouldn’t have had to shoot at a window or cars. He could have actually shot at more people who were on the street at that point. It’s hard to say at this point.""

The chief also addressed a recent report by Fox 5 DC that revealed the girlfriend of the suspect shot and killed by Secret Service after breaking into the Peruvian ambassador’s home in a recent, separate incident lives in the same Van Ness Street apartment building where Spencer leased the unit to carry out his crime. The report said the woman did not know her neighbor.

""We don’t know if one has anything to do with another or if it’s just a coincidence, but if there is, I’m certainly sure that through this investigation we’ll determine a connection if there is one,"" Contee said.

The chief detailed how several cars were shot up during the Van Ness Street incident, including one belonging to a nearby embassy and another belonging to an individual picking up someone at that time. The velocity of the rounds of fire from the rifles recovered can go thousands of yards, Contee said.

D.C. Metro police have recovered at least nine firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition in connection to the incident.

Investigators determined Spencer had rented an apartment on Van Ness Street since January of this year. Surveillance footage shows him wheeling in suitcase at the Van Ness Street location, Contee said.

Police have said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside. At that location, police recovered four long guns and two handguns. Three of the long guns were constructed to be fully automatic, Contee said.

""There was a camera set up in the hallway so that he could see approaching officers,"" the chief added.

The chief said investigators determined Spencer had a second apartment in Fairfax County, Virginia, where police recovered three additional constructs of long gun rifles, as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition. Spencer had rented that Virginia apartment since February 2021.

Spencer attended Wheaton High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, was a lifeguard at some point and spent a brief period of a few months in the U.S. Coast Guard in 2017, Contee confirmed.

""We’re trying to understand all the different facets of this investigation. Financially, how was he able to purchase these firearms and rent these two apartments?"" Contee said. ""There are a lot of things that we need to know that we don’t know. But I am certain through collaboration with our community partners, as well as with our federal partners that we will no doubt get to the bottom of this.""

Contee said Spencer shot himself as officers began to make entry into the apartment. Officers rammed the door, which was blocked by a refrigerator. No physical letters were found at the location, but investigators are also looking into his online activity as they continue to examine a potential motive.

The Washington Post previously reported that Spencer allegedly had posted online and potentially shared body-camera-like footage of himself during the course of the shooting.

Former President Barack Obama raised eyebrows on Wednesday for attempting to link this week's mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, to the anniversary of George Floyd's murder.

Nineteen children and two teachers of Robb Elementary School were murdered by an 18-year-old gunman, who was killed during a gunfire exchange with authorities. Tuesday's tragedy is now among the worst mass shootings in U.S. history.

The bloodshed in Uvalde occurred one day prior to the two-year mark of the death of George Floyd, which sparked civil unrest across the country in 2020 after viral footage showed Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on him as he repeatedly claimed he couldn't breathe until he died.

Chauvin was convicted of second- and third-degree murder last year.

800,Kevin Spacey charged with sexual assaulting 3 men in UK,Stephanie Pagones,"

British prosecutors have charged embattled actor Kevin Spacey with four counts of sexually assaulting three men in the U.K.

The Crown Prosecution Service said Thursday that the charges against the award-winning actor ""follow a review of evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police."" Spacey, 62, was also charged with ""causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent,"" the agency said.

JOSH DUGGAR SENTENCED TO MORE THAN 12 YEARS IN PRISON IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CASE

The alleged incidents took place in London between March 2005 and August 2008, and one in western England in April 2013. The alleged victims are now in their 30s and 40s.

Rosemary Ainslie, head of the service’s Special Crime Division, said the charges follow a review of evidence gathered by London’s Metropolitan Police.

Spacey was questioned by British police in 2019 about claims by several men that he had assaulted them.

The former ""House of Cards"" star ran London’s Old Vic Theatre between 2004 and 2015.

Spacey won a best supporting actor Academy Award for the 1995 film ""The Usual Suspects"" and a lead actor Oscar for the 1999 movie ""American Beauty.""

His celebrated career came to an abrupt halt in 2017 when actor Anthony Rapp accused the star of assaulting him at a party in the 1980s, when Rapp was a teenager.

Spacey denies the allegations and is currently trying to have a sex abuse lawsuit from Rapp in New York thrown out. He testified Thursday in a courtroom in New York City in the civil lawsuit filed by Rapp.

Spacey didn’t respond to reporters as he left the courthouse talking on his mobile phone.

The new criminal charges were mentioned briefly by Rapp's lawyers during the court hearing, and Spacey's lawyers were asked about it by reporters during a break in testimony. They declined to comment.

Thursday's court session in New York City dealt with a technical issue in the civil lawsuit, whether it was better handled in a federal or state U.S. court. Spacey was called to testify about where he lived, not about the truthfulness of the allegations against him.

Spacey testified that his main residence and domicile is in Baltimore, where he moved for the filming of ""House of Cards."" He said he was ""beguiled by its charm, its beauty."" But he also testified about his time living in London as the artistic director of the Old Vic.

""It was extremely important to me that I endear myself to the British public, that I’m not running away,"" he said, noting that his start there was troubled by a ""disastrous production"" in 2005 of Arthur Miller’s last play.

But, he said, ""I’m an American citizen. Once the job was done, I came back to America.""

The school shooting at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school was not the first time a Uvalde school was in the crosshairs of a mass shooter, coming four years after authorities foiled a plot to carry out a Columbine style attack against fellow students at Morales Junior High School.

Two Uvalde middle school students were arrested in 2018 for conspiracy to commit murder, with police saying the 13-year-old and 14-year-old were plotting what was described as a ""mass casualty event against the school,"" according to a May 2018 report from KENS 5.

Uvalde Chief of Police Daniel Rodriguez said the two teenagers were largely influenced by the Columbine High School attack, even referring to themselves by the names of the two shooters that carried out 1999 massacre.

""The investigation revealed that the students were infatuated with the Columbine High School shootings and identified themselves to the shooters. The investigation uncovered that the students even referred to themselves using the Columbine shooter's names,"" Rodriguez said at the time.

Investigators said the students wanted to carry out the attack years from when it was uncovered, with the duo planning to go through with it during their senior year in high school on the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. In addition to firearms, the teens planned to use IEDs during their attack.

""One of the students had numerous writings and drawings, which depicted weapons capable of causing mass destruction. He wrote about being ‘God-like’ and killing police and other persons,"" read a police press release at the time. ""He had an academic analysis of one of the Columbine shooter's journals.""

The teens had a list of students they plotted to kill that were listed by priority, after which they planned to kill at random before eventually turning their weapons on themselves.

""It was scary. We hear it everywhere else, but you don't expect for it to happen in your town,"" a parent said of the arrests at the time. ""I am glad they were able to control the situation before anything does happen. And that they actually did something about it. Sometimes you think they're just going to hear it, and say it won't happen and dust it under the rug, and they actually did something.""

""Any kids that had talked bad about them or said anything they did not like, basically, they said they were going to go and kill them,"" a student said at the time. ""You just felt unsafe. And teachers have been bringing it to our attention that you can't be saying those things anymore. We can't do that. It is wrong.""

A few years later, a Uvalde school was again in the crosshairs when the high school was forced to lockdown due to threats of violence against the school.

Investigators identified a 16-year-old residing in Puerto Rico as being responsible for the threats, with police saying the teen was a former student that had caused trouble in the area a few years prior.

""We have dealt with her before here, she went to school here in 2018. We had problems with her back then,"" Lt. Mariano Pargas Jr., with the Uvalde Police Department, said at the time, according to a report in the Uvalde Leader-News.

The Pentagon Tuesday showcased declassified photos and video of UFOs to Congress – including a flying object without a ""specific"" explanation"" – as lawmakers pressed military officials on the mysterious sightings.

In one brief and shaky video, a small object appeared to zip past a military pilot. In a separate video and a similar photo taken at a different time, glowing triangles are seeing in the night sky.

The visuals were shown during testimony from Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie.

CONGRESS HOLDS HISTORIC PUBLIC UFO HEARING AS MILITARY STRUGGLES TO UNDERSTAND ‘MYSTERY’ FLYING PHENOMENA

Bray, as he presented the images and videos, said the video and photo of the glowing triangles remained unresolved for some time, but was eventually identified as unmanned aerial vehicles.

But he said the military does not know what the object in the first video could be.

""I do not have an explanation for what this specific object is,"" Bray said in an exchange with Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Bray continued to emphasize that many UAP reports have a ""limited amount of high quality data and reporting"" which ""hampers the ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature and intent of UAP.""

Bray also said Tuesday that there have been at least 11 ""near misses"" between U.S. military aircraft and UAP. He also said the U.S. military hasn't tried to communicate with UAP, including the unexplained object in the video shown earlier in the hearing which ""may or may not be in controlled flight.""

The presentation happened in a House Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation Subcommittee Tuesday. It was the first congressional UFO hearing in a generation.

Lawmakers are warning that although there is still a stigma associated with UFOs, which the government officially calls Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), they are a serious national security threat.

""For too long, the stigma associated with UAPs has gotten in the way of good intelligence analysis,"" Carson added. ""Pilots avoided reporting, or were laughed at when they did. DOD officials relegated the issue to the back room, or swept it under the rug entirely, fearful of a skeptical national security community.""

The report also included information on ""common shapes"" of the UAPs, although the entire sections on the shapes are redacted.

The government has said that UAP ""probably lack a single explanation."" Neither classified nor unclassified reports from the government so far rule out space aliens. But other possible explanations are ""airborne clutter"" like birds and balloons, ""natural atmospheric phenomena,"" like ice crystals, highly classified U.S. government programs, or ""foreign adversary systems"" from Russia, China or other countries.

809,Biden walks back bombshell Taiwan comments for third time,Anders Hagstrom,"

President Biden walked back an assertion that the U.S. would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan against China for the third time of his presidency on Tuesday.

Biden stated unequivocally on Monday that the U.S. would send the military to defend Taiwan if China invaded the island nation. He walked back that statement on Tuesday, however, saying the U.S. position of ""strategic ambiguity"" on Taiwan has not changed.

It was the third time of Biden's presidency that he had appeared to announce the bombshell change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan only to have White House officials walk it back within hours.

Biden first made the blunder in an August 2021 interview with George Stephanopoulos, in which he listed Taiwan among America's closest allies. Stephanopoulos pressed Biden on the implications of the then-ongoing U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

US MILITARY WILL DEFEND TAIWAN ‘IF IT COMES TO THAT,’ BIDEN SAYS

""You talked about our adversaries, China and Russia. You already see China telling Taiwan, ‘See? You can’t count on the Americans.’"" the anchor asked.

""We have made – kept every commitment. We made a sacred commitment to Article Five that if in fact anyone were to invade or take action against our NATO allies, we would respond,"" Biden said at the time. ""Same with Japan, same with South Korea, same with – Taiwan. It’s not even comparable to talk about that.""

In fact, the U.S. has not made a formal defense treaty with Taiwan, as it has with NATO countries, South Korea and Japan. The administration then walked the statement back, resorting to an unnamed official who clarified that ""U.S. policy has not changed.""

Biden made the statement again during a CNN town hall in October, stating that the U.S. has a ""commitment"" to defend Taiwan against an attack.

""Can you vow to protect Taiwan?"" an audience member asked.

""Yes,"" Biden responded, adding that the U.S. remains the most powerful military force in the world.

""So are you saying the United States would come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked?"" host Anderson Cooper pressed.

""Yes, we have a commitment,"" Biden said.

CHINA LAUNCHES MILITARY EXERCISES IN SOUTH CHINA SEA AS BIDEN VISITS ASIA

In reality, however, the U.S. only has a commitment to the One China policy and the Taiwan Relations Act. The former states that the government of Beijing is the sole government of China, adding that the U.S. acknowledges, but does not endorse, Beijing's claim to own Taiwan.

The latter allows for substantial, but non-diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Taiwan.

The White House released a statement walking back Biden's townhall remarks the following day, arguing that Biden ""was not announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy.""

""The U.S. defense relationship with Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act,"" the White House said at the time. ""We will uphold our commitment under the Act, we will continue to support Taiwan's self-defense, and we will continue to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.""

Experts have slammed the Biden administration for the repeated back-and-forth between the president and his own staff on the issue. Asia expert Gordon Chang described the situation as ""amateur-hour"" at the White House on Tuesday.

Demonstrators chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" stormed the Oklahoma Capitol on Wednesday, forcing the state House of Representatives into lockdown, in order to protest several Republican-backed bills, including one that provides legal protections to motorists fleeing riots.

More than two dozen protesters filled the gallery on the fifth floor while the Oklahoma House in the chamber below was in session. Video showed demonstrators chanting, ""Stand united against all hate,"" and ""We will use our voices to stand against corruption, to fight hate, to defend Black and Brown lives."" The disturbance interrupted the session for several minutes.

One bill increases penalties for protesters blocking traffic and protects drivers who unintentionally strike drivers with their cars. Another aims to protect law enforcement and their families from ""doxxing.""

One man stood nose-to-nose with a lawmaker who met him on the gallery in what appeared to be a heated verbal confrontation until another female protester pulled him away. ""You’re a disgrace, you’re an embarrassment to the whole f---ing nation,"" the male protesters shouted as he left.

WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE

""You are traitors, insurrectionists, seditionists,"" another woman shouted as protesters trickled out of the gallery.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol escorted protesters from the building, and a drug dog was brought into the chamber to make sure ""nothing was left behind,"" KOCO reporter Dillon Richards tweeted.

House Bill 1674, co-authored by Republican state Rep. Kevin West and his GOP colleague state Sen. Rob Standridge, creates a misdemeanor for unlawfully obstructing traffic while participating in a riot. It also adds criminal and civil liability protections ""for motor vehicle operators who unintentionally cause injury or death to an individual participating in a riot under certain circumstances,"" the Oklahoma Legislature said.

The bill also ""provides that organizations found to be involved with individuals participating in riots or unlawful assemblies shall be punished by a fine that is ten times the amount of the fine authorized by the appropriate provision of the bill,"" according to the proposed legislation’s fiscal analysis.

""This is an important protection for citizens who are just trying to get out of a bad situation,"" West said, according to The Oklahoman. ""When fleeing an unlawful riot, they should not face threat of prosecution for trying to protect themselves, their families or their property.""

Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, approved the bill Wednesday, the Oklahoma Legislature said.

OKLAHOMA GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL TO PROTECT DRIVERS WHO HIT RIOTERS

A second bill the governor signed into law Wednesday makes doxxing law enforcement or other public officials by publishing their personal information online a crime.

The punishment would be doubled upon the second conviction of the same offense, the bill says.

ACLU Oklahoma has argued the bill is too broad and anyone who posts videos or photos of law enforcement would be expected to blur out names on badges, KFOR reported.

811,"China's interest in US agriculture poses security threat, federal report warns",Caitlin Mcfall,"

China’s determination to become self-sufficent and resolve its food security challenges could put the U.S., as the world's leading producer in agriculture, in Beijing’s crosshairs, a federal report warned this week.

The report released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) warned that China’s efforts to bolster its agricultural sector not only pose an economic challenge but a threat to U.S. security.

China’s failure to secure enough domestic production to feed its mammoth population means it has looked to nations like the U.S. to acquire farmland, livestock, equipment and intellectual property – in some cases through theft.

""The United States is a global leader in all of these fields, making it a prime trading partner and often a target of China’s efforts to strengthen its agriculture sector and food security, sometimes through illicit means,"" the report stated.

US NOT INTERESTED IN 'COLD WAR' WITH CHINA, PLANS TO INCREASE DIRECT COMMUNICATION: BLINKEN

China is looking to dominate the genetically modified seed industry, which has the potential for massive economic windfalls.

Advancing Beijing’s seed stockpiles would not only reduce its dependence on nations like the U.S., it could make it a major competitor in the global market.

The USCC report found that the U.S. exported $1.62 billion worth of seeds, mostly vegetables, corn, soybeans and grasses, in 2020.

In 2021, $173.9 million of exported seeds were sold to China alone, which equated to roughly 15% of total exports.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has directed the agricultural industry to expand its seed collection as he looks to cut China’s reliance on foreign resources.

Rather than directing its resources for development and research in domestic seed innovations, spying has become a chief tool for its agriculture industry.

""Acquiring U.S. trade secrets through agricultural espionage has become a convenient way for China to improve its agricultural output and become more competitive in global markets,"" the report found. ""Agricultural IP theft could enable Chinese agribusinesses to undercut U.S. competitors on international seed markets.""

But outside the economic woes Beijing could inflict on the U.S. lies an even more ominous threat on U.S. food production.

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER PUSHES LEGISLATION TO STOP CHINA BUILDING 'AGRICULTURAL MONOPOLY' IN US

Genetically engineered seeds help to circumvent the unpredictable reality the agriculture industry faces every season by mitigating the risk of drought, pests and diseases.

Though the technology behind genetically modifying a crop can save a farming season, it can also be used to target engineered crops.

""One vulnerability of genetically modified seeds is their limited genetic variation. Consequently, a virus or fungus engineered to kill a genetically modified plant could wipe out an entire crop with no genetic variation to mitigate the losses,"" the report found.

House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Rep. Glenn Thompson told Fox News ""food security is national security"" and said the USCC report showed the U.S. needs to take tougher stances to safeguard U.S. intellectual property and the agricultural industry.

""Our producers go to great lengths to guarantee the U.S. provides the safest food supply, and that cannot be jeopardized,"" he said. ""It is high time to reinforce our battered supply chains and ensure U.S. producers have access to free and fair markets to ease the impact of the looming global food crisis.""

Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, China expressed concern that bioterrorism could be an increasing threat and biosecurity became a chief priority for the nation.

Traditionally, China has been hesitant to import animals and plants that have been genetically modified.

But the report noted that Beijing has ""increasingly acknowledged the strategic advantages [of] genetically modified organisms"" and could be using Western imports to develop its technology and achieve global agricultural dominance.

""The Chinese Communist Party clearly wants to supplant our country’s influence and leadership in every area, including agriculture,"" Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. John Boozman told Fox News. ""We must not fall asleep at the switch and give China an opening to exploit.

""The Biden administration and Congress must make every effort to protect our food supply, the intellectual property and technology that make our agriculture industry the envy of the world and our supply chains from vulnerabilities Beijing wishes to leverage to its benefit and U.S. detriment,"" Boozman added.

815,"75 years after it was first deployed, will US Army bring back the 'jeep'?",Peter Suciu,"

Were it not for efforts by the U.S. military to develop a lightweight, unarmored, all-terrain vehicle for the battlefield there might not be a market for SUVs today. It all began 75 years ago last December when the United States military adopted the 'jeep', and while the iconic military vehicle was phased out and replaced by the Humvee – the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) in the early 1980s – the Army could go full circle and bring back the jeep.

Last year the Army began gearing up its Ground Mobility Vehicle Program for fiscal 2017. It was part of the Army's Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy that sought to procure lightweight combat vehicles for infantry brigade combat teams. The vehicles considered sound very much like what first entered service back in 1940.

The Origins of the Jeep

The U.S. Army saw the need for such a go-anywhere four-wheel vehicle when it went ""Over There"" to France during the First World War. The Four Wheel Drive Auto (FWD) and Thomas B. Jeffery Company supplied the military with the first four-wheel drive trucks, but with another war looming military planners saw a need for a new light, cross-country reconnaissance vehicle. In July 1940 the Army formalized its requirements, which were submitted to 135 U.S. automobile manufacturers.

In the end only two companies – the American Bantam Car Company and Willys-Overland Motors – entered the process, while Ford Motor Company joined the competition a little later. In the end Bantam won the bid, and did deliver a prototype known as the ""Blitz Buggy"" to the U.S. Army for testing. However, Bantam lacked the production capacity needed on the scale of the War Department, so Willys and Ford each were sent blueprints and developed their own respective prototypes. In the end Willys won the contract due its design having the more powerful engine, but it also featured elements from the Bantam and Ford designs.

During World War II Willys-Overland produced some 363,000 'jeeps' but as it couldn't meet the production target, Ford then produced another 280,000. The actual name is itself still debated – with some suggesting it was a term used by Army mechanics for any untried vehicle during testing, but another story is that it was named after Eugene the Jeep, a character in the Popeye cartoons. Finally, another story is that it came about from the acronym ""GP"" for ""General Purpose.""

Ford unsuccessfully sued Willys over the name, which Willys retained and used to market its first Civilian Jeep – the CJ – the first mass-produced 4x4 vehicle for the civilian market.

""The 'jeep' has an enduring legacy partly because they were the first of a kind, were used all over the world in WWII and their impact and was significant,"" Randy Withrow, director of The U.S. Veterans Memorial Museum in Huntsville, Alabama, told FoxNews.com.

Humvee and Other 'Jeep' Replacements

The 'jeep' as the main light go-anywhere vehicle served through the Korean and Vietnam Wars, although it went through numerous upgrades and updates. By the 1980s, however, the U.S. military began to seek alternative options, and opted for a larger vehicle that could do what the 'jeep' did but could also take on the duties of other light military wheeled vehicles.

The result was the aforementioned Humvee, which had its baptism of fire in Operation Just Cause, the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. The irony was that this was also to be the final military operation for the 'jeep', which had been in service since 1940.

""The workhorse small utility vehicle for the past many years has been the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles made by AM General,"" Brad Curran, aerospace and defense industry principal analyst at Frost & Sullivan, told FoxNews.com.

""The HUMMWV was a replacement for several vehicles, including the Vietnam War era Ford MUTT – last of the jeeps to my mind – but also the weapons carrier, the Gama Goat and the Mule,"" Withrow told FoxNews.com. ""All the compromises and combinations resulted in a vehicle that was 'huge' by jeep standards.""

Now after 25 years in service it is apparent the Humvee can't do it all. It won't exactly be the end of the road for the Humvee, but the military may be putting drivers behind the wheel of other, more versatile alternative vehicles.

""Many of these units will start to be phased out by the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) made by Oshkosh,"" added Frost & Sullivan's Curran. ""In addition, special operations command operates various small engine and electrical vehicles made by recreational off road makers like Polaris and others.""

The JLTV isn't the first vehicle to offer an alternative option to the Humvee – as the military already has the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected or MRAP, the special armored vehicles that were designed to counter land mines. From 2007 until 2012 some 12,000 MRAPs were deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Just as the MRAP didn't replace the Humvee the JLTV won't replace it either.

""This isn't a complete replacement for the Humvee,"" Dan Wasserbly, editor at Jane's, told FoxNews.com. ""The Army is simply looking for a vehicle that has greater tactical mobility. Something that is lighter and faster than a modern Humvee.""

It is instead about finding the right vehicle for the job. What the MRAP provided in armor and protection was offset by a lack of mobility.

""What we have seen from the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan is that one size doesn't fit all uses, especially when it is a big wide platform like the Humvee,"" Wasserbly added. ""The threat is different and the military needs to weigh its options. The MRAP also isn't ideal for humanitarian missions, as it is too big to fit down many tight streets.""

Back to Small Tactical Vehicles

Thus with the JLTV program the military may be going back to small and lighter vehicles that can provide greater mobility. Earlier this year the Army ordered an initial batch of the half truck/half-'jeep' like vehicles.

""With the JLTV Oshkosh has delivered the vehicle the military needs,"" Col. John Bryant, USMC (Retired), senior vice president of defense programs for Oshkosh Defense, told FoxNews.com. ""The JLTV provides the ballistic protection of a light tactical tank, the mine resistance of an MRAP and the off-road capabilities of a Baja racer. It is mobile enough that it can be airlifted where it is needed, and the JLTV is very modular and scalable so that the command can determine how to best utilize it in the field.""

The JLTV is in its initial production stage, and throughout 2019 the military will be conducting live fire and reliability testing. Moreover, the JLTV was just one of several options considered, and the U.S. Army had looked at vehicles from Polaris, Lockheed Martin and Boeing-MSI Defense.

Earlier this year the U.S. Army had negotiations with Hendrick Dynamics, which developed a modified light off-road vehicle built on the Jeep Wrangler with a modified JP-8 diesel engine. This Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) vehicle was dubbed the Commando and is now officially designated the Grand Mobility Vehicle (GMV).

""We're right in the transition to light mobility for our military,"" Marshall Carlson, Hendrick Dynamics’ general manager, told FoxNews.com. ""This is much lighter than the JLTV, and it won't be armored – it is what is being called a 'better boot.' The GMV is for those light infantry and airborne infantry that can only move across the battlefield by walking at 3mph. This is literally a people mover that can go anywhere.""

What also makes the GMV program notable is that Hendrick Dynamics is contracting the Jeeps from Chrysler, which is bringing the iconic vehicle back to the battlefield.

""Chrysler has been a great supporter of this program,"" added Carlson, ""These are the export versions with the diesel engines, and we're modifying these for the military to provide that needed mobility. We think this is a game changer and one that literally went back to the future and took another look at the jeep.""",https://www.foxnews.com

Dr. James Sowa, 64, was found dead inside his home and chiropractic office on Nov. 2 in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, a town about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia.

O'Boyle had been a patient of Sowa's two months earlier and blamed the chiropractor for worsening his jaw pain, according to his relatives.

Surveillance video captured O'Boyle pulling up to Sowa's office on the morning of the murder without an appointment and spending just one minute inside before fleeing the scene.

Biden’s comments were in line with his tough stance on guns during the 2020 presidential campaign. Speaking during a fundraising event in Seattle in November 2019, Biden said he supported the Second Amendment but called absolutist arguments about gun-rights ""bizarre.""

""Why should we allow people to have military-style weapons including pistols with 9-mm bullets and can hold 10 or more rounds,"" he said.

The 9mm round is the most popular handgun caliber in the United States, accounting for well over half of all handguns produced in 2019, according to Shooting Industry magazine. The data showed that throughout the 2010s, 9mm pistols made up more than 40% of all pistols produced in the United States – or roughly four in every 10 pistols.

The Second Amendment is once again in the crosshairs after a lone gunman, identified as 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, killed 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, some 85 miles west of San Antonio.

820,Driving under the influence: Pelosi's mega-millionaire husband could have saved thousands by calling an Uber,Jessica Chasmar,"

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's mega-millionaire husband allegedly drove under the influence of alcohol in Napa County, California, on Saturday night instead of calling an Uber or taxi, resulting in a car crash and thousands of dollars for his bail following his arrest on suspicion of drunk driving.

The California Highway Patrol said Paul Pelosi, 82, was driving a 2021 Porsche that was hit by a 2014 Jeep as Pelosi's car tried to cross State Route 29 in Napa, according to multiple reports.

Neither of the drivers in the crash was injured, and an investigation is ongoing, the CHP said.

Paul Pelosi was arrested at 11:44 p.m. and charged with driving with a blood-alcohol level of .08 or higher as well as driving under the influence of alcohol, both misdemeanors. He was booked into Napa Valley Detention Center at 4:13 a.m. on Sunday with bail set at $5,000 and released at 7:26 a.m., according to Napa County records.

HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI'S HUSBAND PAUL ARRESTED IN CALIFORNIA, CHARGED WITH DUI

Speaker Pelosi, D-Calif., is one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with a net worth of at least $114 million, according to her 2018 personal financial disclosure. Paul Pelosi has accumulated more than $100 million from his San Francisco-based venture capital firm, Financial Leasing Services, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

It is unclear whether, before the crash, Pelosi was headed to the vineyard that he and Speaker Pelosi owned as recently as last year. However, if he was leaving Napa to travel to San Francisco, where the Pelosi family owns multiple properties, and had chosen Uber instead of driving, it would have cost approximately $103.90. A Black SUV for the ride, Uber’s most expensive option, would have cost only $329.54. There are also several hotel options in the Napa area that start around $150.

A first-time drunken driving offense can cost a driver upwards of $10,000 in fines and legal fees, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

The NHTSA estimates that 32 people in the U.S. die every day in drunken-driving related crashes, or one person every 45 minutes.

According to Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), an average drunken driver has driven drunk over 80 times before their first arrest.

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES BELOW

An Arlington, Texas, man lost both of his ears after he was attacked by two dogs this week, according to authorities. The dogs were likely pit bulls.

The man, identified as Milton Sturges, 58, was out walking Wednesday when the dogs attacked. A neighbor who heard the man screaming called police, who, upon arrival, reportedly saw the man being mauled, local news station CBS 11 reported.

NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS SHOULD AVOID FLORENCE-AFFECTED WATERS, OFFICIALS SAY

One officer struck the dogs -- believed to be adult pit bulls, one male and one female -- with a weapon. Eventually, they successfully pulled the dogs off the man.

Sturges was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries.

“He lost both of his ears. His nose was partially torn off and his bottom lip was partially torn off,” Omar Sturges, Milton’s nephew, told the news station.

Milton Sturges will now require reconstructive surgery, according to a GoFundMe created to assist with medical expenses.

Officials with the Arlington Police Department are now conducting an investigation into the incident and are searching for the dogs’ owners. Authorities told CBS 11 the male pit bull, which weighed an estimated 80 pounds, was gray with “cropped ears” and “appeared to have chain marks (scars) around [his] neck as if he had been chained up.”

The female, which was brown and also had cropped ears, weighed roughly 55 pounds and “appeared to have previously had a liter(s) of puppies,” authorities said, according to the news station.

Following the attack, both dogs reportedly died after they were taken by local animal control officials. Neither dog was wearing a collar or was microchipped, CBS 11 reported.

Though he’s still recovering, Milton Sturges is now in stable condition and is “talking” and “moving around,” Omar Sturges said.

824,"Kirk Cameron: Public schools grooming kids with critical race theory, 'sexual chaos,' and 'racial confusion'",Hannah Grossman,"

Award-winning actor Kirk Cameron blasted America's public schools for becoming breeding grounds for far-left progressive agendas, including critical race theory, Nikole Hannah-Jones' 1619 Project, and gender ideology.

""The problem is that public school systems have become so bad. It's sad to say they're doing more for grooming, for sexual chaos and the progressive left than any real educating about the things that most of us want to teach our kids,"" he told Fox News Digital. The solution to the problem, he said, was for parents to take the lead on their children's education and teach them at home. To make the case, the award-winning actor referenced his upcoming movie, ""The Homeschool Awakening.""

The movie follows the journey of about 17 homeschooling families who respond to misconceptions and stereotypes. In the film, Cameron also discusses his journey to homeschool his six children with his wife, Chelsea.

Cameron's father, grandmother, and grandfather were teachers. He stressed that there are many excellent teachers in the U.S., but the school system is holding them back from being a ""light in the darkness, [and] to pass on the kinds of values and virtues that made this the freest, strongest, most prosperous nation in the whole world.""

HOMESCHOOLING SURGE CONTINUES DESPITE SCHOOLS REOPENING

Cameron takes issue with the perspective that a child's education should be left solely to the so-called experts, without parents' input. ""And that's just a fundamental difference in the way that we look at. Who has been entrusted with the sacred responsibility of raising our children? Is it the parents or is it the government?""

He went on to strongly criticize ""those who are rotting out the minds and souls of America's children"" and said they were ""spreading a terminal disease, not education.""

""And you can take your pick. Just go down the list. The things that are destroying the family, destroying the church, destroying love for our great country: critical race theory, teaching kids to pick their pronouns and decide whether they want to be a boy or a girl, The 1619 Project,"" he said.

Cameron said the ""genesis"" of creating, what would become a project that spanned over two years, was the novel coronavirus pandemic. At that time, he said, parents were finally starting to see the things schools were teaching their kids.

""If we send our children to Rome to be educated … we shouldn't be surprised if they come back Romans,"" Cameron said. ""If we want them … to love God and love their neighbor and feel gratitude and thankful that they live in the United States of America, the freest country on earth, then you've got to teach them those things … I realized that there was no better way for our family to do that … then to bring them home and join in with this rich, robust community, with tons of curriculum to to to be able to have the flexibility and freedom to raise our kids the way we wanted them to be raised.""

""Homeschool was not on our radar screen because we had these misconceptions and stereotypes like so many people do. Like, you know, that's for like Quakers and the Amish, and how could you possibly teach your kids enough so that they get into college? What about socialization?"" Cameron said. However, after going through the process, Cameron learned that his children were able to socialize with people of all ages, and that the world was his kids' classroom.

""When you're together as a family … you're able to travel, … [and] you're not locked into a schedule that everyone else is locked into, … you can discover your own individuality and uniqueness … And it really lends itself to a healthy, flourishing community in your home,"" he said.

""Yes, there are hard days. Yes, there are times when you just feel like pulling your hair out. But it's nothing compared to wanting to go back and do it all over again. If you see that your children went down a road and you can't pull them back, [asking] how did they lose their faith? How did they get pulled into an ideology that undermines everything that is going to lead to their success?""

""They learn to reject a God, … they learn to reject our country. And how did that happen? Well, that's the kind of regret that we don't want as parents. And so if we're willing to put in some extra effort and time now, we will be so glad that we did and will lift our hands in gratitude and say, ‘Thank you that I woke up and I saw the light.’ And millions of parents are.""",https://www.foxnews.com
825,"Florida private schools hired felons as teachers, prompting investigation: report",Bradford Betz,"

State officials in Florida have launched an investigation into three private schools in the Orlando area that hired felons as teachers.

The probe by the state Department of Education was prompted by a recent report in the Orlando Sentinel citing three cases in which felons were hired.

One woman landed a job at Winners Primary School in Orlando in November 2016, only one month after being released from prison following a conviction for Medicaid fraud, Department of Corrections records show.

In another case, a man was hired by Southland Christian School in Kissimmee, despite being denied employment at another private school only one mile away. He had been convicted of three felonies in 2011.

Another teacher was hired at Kingsway Christian Academy in Orlando 12 years ago, despite having been convicted of third-degree felony theft in the early 1990s. She remained at the school until March 2018, when she was arrested for abusing a child on campus.

The cases at Southland and Kingsway reportedly violated Florida laws prohibiting private schools that take scholarship money from hiring employees with convictions.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, private schools in Florida are responsible for conducting background checks.

The education department wrote to the three schools Monday, requesting names of their employees, background checks, and evidence that the teachers with felonies had been fired.

The schools’ responses to the department's inquiries are due May 9.

A former Virginia Tech football player was acquitted of murder charges Friday in the deadly beating of a man accused of pretending to be a woman during a sexual encounter after the two matched on Tinder.

A jury in Montgomery County Circuit Court found 19-year-old Isimemen Etute not guilty of a charge of second-degree murder in the 2021 death of Jerry Smith, 40, of Blacksburg. The jury deliberated for approximately three hours before returning its verdict around 6:30 p.m., The Roanoke Times reported.

Prosecutors had earlier told the jury that Etute, then 18, became enraged and fatally beat Smith when he discovered Smith was a man. Smith, who identified as a gay man, presented himself in a profile on the online dating app Tinder as a 21-year-old emergency room physician named Angie Renee.

Smith performed oral sex on Etute, who later returned to the apartment to find out if his date was a man or a woman. In taking the stand earlier in the week, Etute had testified that he felt ""violated"" when he discovered that the Tinder match he believed to be a woman was actually a man.

Etute had testified that Smith reached for what Etute thought was a gun. Smith did not own a gun, but police reported finding a knife between the man's mattress and box spring.

Defense attorney Jimmy Turk argued that Etute had acted in self-defense, whereas Smith had been ""controlling the entire environment and the entire episode,"" had ""demanded that it be dark"" and had hidden a knife under his mattress ""in case there was something awry.""

During closing arguments, Turk described Smith as a ""deceitful and dishonest man"" who ""defrauded young men for his own sexual gratification,"" according to The Roanoke Times.

""Who is the real victim here?"" the attorney said through tears. ""This was a wicked sexual ruse.""

Etute said he punched Smith five times and kicked him to gain time to escape the apartment.

""What does the fox say? Last night, I found out,"" he tweeted, after telling reporters about the encounter. ""Joking aside, animal bites are extremely serious. In the case of an encounter, please speak with a physician immediately.""

Bera, a doctor, shared a link to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s information on rabies and added that he was OK and had already returned to work.

Bera’s communications director Travis Horne called it ""an unfortunate encounter"" but said it was ""inconclusive"" as to whether the fox’s fangs actually pierced the congressman’s skin.

""Out of an abundance of caution and per the Attending Physicians recommendation, Rep. Bera went to Walter Reed Hospital last night and received his appropriate shots,"" he said. ""Rep. Bera feels well and is at work today.

Bera told reporters he fought the animal off with an umbrella, according to Heather Caygle from Punchbowl News.

""Capitol police came out and then fox ran away,"" he said. ""It was the most bizarre day in Congress.""

The fox also allegedly bit Politico reporter Ximena Bustillo.

""That feel when you get bit by a fox leaving Capitol cause that’s of course something I expect in THE MIDDLE OF DC,"" she tweeted.

By around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, police said they’d outfoxed the furry fugitive, tweeting out pictures of their captive in a blue carry crate.

A Capitol police spokesperson told Fox News Digital that in all, ""roughly six people reported bites or nips,"" but an exact number of attacks was not immediately available.

""It is not clear if there was just one aggressive fox,"" the spokesperson said, urging anyone else who encounters one to call DC Animal Control.

According to the House Sergeant at Arms, there may be ""several fox dens"" around the Capitol, but police said the reports of aggressive behavior were new.

Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, shared video of a fox running across a Capitol lawn she told Fox News’ Chad Pergram she recorded while on a jog last month.

837,"Buffalo shooting: Retired federal agent may have had advanced notice about shooter’s plans, report says",Brie Stimson,"

Federal officials investigating the deadly Buffalo grocery store shooting are trying to find out if a retired federal agent from Texas, who reportedly talked to the alleged shooter online frequently, was one of a handful of people who knew about the shooting about 30 minutes before the attack was carried out.

Payton Gendron, 18, invited around 30 people in a chatroom devoted to racism to read his White supremacist ramblings and then showed them his plans less than an hour before he went to Tops Supermarket and allegedly killed 10 Black people, according to The Buffalo News.

The unnamed retired agent from an unnamed agency was reportedly among those invited to see Gendron’s plans, but it’s unclear if he accepted, two law enforcement officials told the newspaper.

The former agent and six others suspected of regularly chatting with Gendron on the forum could potentially be charged as accomplices. The FBI is attempting to find and interview them.

BUFFALO SHOOTING SUSPECT CONFRONTED IN COURTROOM: ‘YOU’RE A COWARD'

The FBI has confirmed that no officials were warned by any individuals of what the alleged shooter planned to do before the attack, an official said.

""These were like-minded people who used this chat group to talk about their shared interests in racial hatred, replacement theory and hatred of anyone who is Jewish, a person of color or not of European ancestry,"" one of the officials told the Buffalo News. ""What is especially upsetting is that these six people received advanced notice of the Buffalo shooting, about 30 minutes before it happened.""

TOPS GROCERY STORE MANAGER TALKED TO SUSPECT BEFORE SHOOTING: ‘HOW DID WE MISS THIS?’

He added, ""The FBI has verified that none of these people called law enforcement to warn them about the shooting. The FBI database shows no advance tips from anyone that this shooting was about to happen.""

Officials say Gendron traveled from three hours away, specifically targeting Black shoppers in the store.

John V. Elmore, a local civil rights attorney said, ""If he had advance notice, he had a moral obligation to get on the phone and try to notify someone about it.""

He represents the family of Andre Mackniel, 53, who was one of the 10 people killed in the attack. He was buying a birthday cake for his 3-year-old son.

Georgia has confirmed a case of suspected monkeypox virus.

The state's Department of Public Health said that the confirmed orthopoxvirus was detected in a male metro Atlanta resident who has a history of international travel.

""The CDC is doing confirmatory testing to determine if this is monkeypox,"" the department tweeted.

The Georgia Department of Health said it is conducting contact tracing and monitoring the individual who is currently isolating at home.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now shows 19 monkeypox cases confirmed around the nation.

MONKEYPOX AND ENDEMIC DISEASES BECOMING MORE PERSISTENT, WHO SAYS

The World Health Organization (WHO) said Wednesday that there are now more than 550 confirmed monkeypox cases from 30 countries that are not endemic for the disease.

While experts believe monkeypox is not expected to become a pandemic, much remains unknown regarding recent transmission and outbreaks.

Although the majority of new monkeypox cases have been seen in gay or bisexual men, experts caution that anyone is at potential risk.

Monkeypox spreads when there is close contact with an infected individual, but it is not yet known whether it is being transmitted now exclusively by sex.

It also is unclear if people could spread monkeypox without symptoms or if the disease might be airborne.

Traditionally, monkeypox virus is spread by touching or getting bitten by infected wild animals in western and central Africa.

Scientists have not yet determined whether these outbreaks can be traced to Africa and a top adviser to the WHO previously claimed that current cases were likely linked to sex at two raves in Spain and Belgium.

No deaths from the virus have been reported thus far and the majority of patients recover without requiring hospitalization.

840,Avenatti claims prison officials only let him read Trump's 'The Art of the Deal',Kyle Morris,"

Disgraced California attorney Michael Avenatti has filed a claim against the Federal Bureau of Prisons for mistreatment, claiming he was only allowed to read from one source while being held under federal custody.

The $94 million claim, which was first obtained by CBS News, seeks $1 million for each day he says he was held in solitary confinement or lockdown and claims he was only allowed to read former President Trump's book, ""The Art of the Deal.""

POLITICO PROFILE OF MICHAEL AVENATTI RECOUNTS SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP: 'HE USED THE MEDIA, AND WE USED HIM'

In the claim, Avenatti says he was mistreated while he was in federal custody because of his criticism of Trump and former Attorney General William Barr.

Under the Federal Tort Claims Act , Avenatti alleged that during his time in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan in 2020, the federal government is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, false arrest and other acts.

Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a lawyer representing Avenatti, said the filing was sent to the Bureau of Prisons on Wednesday.

""We see this case as a gross misuse of the prison administrative system to punish someone for criticizing the president,"" Margulis-Ohnuma said in a statement to Fox News.

""The claim contains evidence that the decision to keep Mr. Avenatti under atrocious conditions was made at the highest level of government,"" the attorney added. ""His treatment cannot be explained by any security concerns and represents a fundamental break from American values.""

CBS News reported: ""The claim, known as a Standard Form 95, is the first step toward a potential lawsuit against the government. If a settlement cannot be reached or the agency denies the claim within six months, Avenatti could then file a lawsuit under the FTCA against the U.S. in federal court.""

Rep. Mondaire Jones said Thursday Democrats will abolish the Senate filibuster and pack the Supreme Court in order to pass more restrictions on guns, as the House prepares to advance a package of gun bills next week.

Jones, D-N.Y., made the comments at a House Judiciary Committee markup on a package called the ""Protecting Our Kids Act."" The emergency committee meeting was called by Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., in response to the mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, a group of primarily moderate senators is negotiating a more modest agreement that could make it through the Senate, which has a 60-vote filibuster that gives the GOP minority far more say than in the House.

""Democrats blame guns. They criticize the NRA. They call Republicans names. But let's be honest, they've told us what they want to do. Their real beef is with the Second Amendment,"" Jordan added.

843,"Florida Medicaid moves against transgender therapies coverage, calls it 'experimental'",Hannah Grossman,"

FIRST ON FOX – Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration appears to have taken a preliminary step against Medicaid coverage for transgender therapies after reviewing the medical literature on the benefits and the possible severe consequences of available treatments, Fox News Digital has learned.

Florida Medicaid does not currently have a specific policy on covering transgender treatments. In general, its Medicaid coverage is determined based on Generally Accepted Professional Medical Standards (GAPMS). To determine GAPMS, the agency considered a review of research, consulted with experts, and entered into a final review by the Deputy Secretary for Medicaid. Secretary Tom Wallace signed the report indicating that he concurs with its findings.

The report said, ""Florida Medicaid has determined that the research supporting sex reassignment treatment is insufficient to demonstrate efficacy and safety … Considering the weak evidence supporting the use of puberty suppression, cross-sex hormones, and surgical procedures when compared to the stronger research demonstrating the permanent effects they cause, these treatments do not conform to [generally accepted medical standards] and are experimental and investigational.""

FLORIDA SCHOOL DISTRICT GUIDE SUGGESTS HIDING TRANSGENDER IDENTITY FROM PARENTS: ADVOCACY GROUP

Early treatment for youth experiencing gender dysphoria includes injections of puberty blockers, or gonadotropin hormone (GnRH) analogs, which provide time to figure out the possible future steps without the interference of some changes in puberty, such as the development of breasts in females and facial hair in males. However, puberty blockers can have adverse side effects that affect growth, future fertility and bone density, according to the Mayo Clinic.

The next part of the transition process includes cross-sex hormones. In females, masculinizing hormones can cause permanent changes such as facial and body hair growth, male-pattern baldness, deepening of the voice, and the development of an enlarged clitoris, the report said. In males, the feminizing hormones can cause irreversible effects such as breast growth. Sexual dysfunction is possibly irreversible in males, and a decrease in sperm production and infertility is likely irreversible.

The Food and Drug Administration has not explicitly cleared hormone therapies for gender dysphoria treatment. As such, prescribers use it for ""off-label"" care, meaning the therapies are used to treat a medical condition it is not officially approved to treat.

""Cross-sex hormones pose significant long-term health risks to transitioning individuals. Currently, little information is available given that researchers have not had adequate time to study the effects in this population,"" the report said. ""The overall scientific consensus concludes that individuals who take cross-sex hormones will reduce the primary sexual function of his or her natal sex organs.""

""Prescribers of cross-sex hormones focus so heavily on behavioral health outcomes that they de-emphasize that these drugs cause permanent physical changes and side effects that can lead to premature death.""

It continued, ""Use of hormones for other conditions has yielded data on how these drugs can affect the body and the cardiovascular system in particular. Because of the high dosages required to achieve physical change and the need to continuously take the drugs, cross-sex hormones can potentially harm quality of life and reduce life expectancy for transitioning individuals.""

The report, which was released following a request from Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Simone Marstiller, followed a series of laws and maneuvers in Florida regarding transgender youth.

An April 20 guidance was released by the Florida Department of Health which recommended against hormone therapies, gender-reassignment surgery and social transitioning.

""Encouraging mastectomy, ovariectomy, uterine extirpation, penile disablement, tracheal shave, the prescription of hormones which are out of line with the genetic make-up of the child, or puberty blockers, are all clinical practices which run an unacceptably high risk of doing harm,"" the guidance said.

844,"Ukraine funding bill: These 11 Republican senators split from party leadership, opposed $40 billion in aid",Tyler Olson,"

In a split with party leaders, 11 Senate Republicans Thursday voted against a bill to send $40 billion in military aid to Ukraine as Russia's invasion of the nation nears its fourth month.

Despite some GOP opposition, the bill passed by a final tally of 86-11, with the support of leadership from both parties and a significant majority of Republican senators. It will now go to President Biden's desk.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., led the opposition to the bill, demanding an inspector general be appointed to oversee the spending. The U.S. total financial commitment to the Russian war on Ukraine will now total nearly $54 billion.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: PUTIN'S WAR CONTINUES, BUT UKRAINIAN SPIRITS ARE STILL HIGH

Paul was joined voting against the bill Thursday by Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., John Boozman, R-Ark., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Mike Lee, R-Utah, Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., and Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.

All of those Republicans voted ""no"" in previous procedural votes to advance the bill. No Democrats voted against the legislation.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who visited Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy over the weekend, pushed for the Senate to pass the bill since last week.

""Today, the Senate will approve more lethal assistance for Ukraine. And it's going to be a bipartisan landslide,"" McConnell said Thursday ahead of the vote. ""Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger costs should Ukraine lose.""

US EMBASSY IN KYIV, UKRAINE REOPENS AFTER 3 MONTHS

But the senators opposing the bill gave differing reasons for why, including opposition to the general policy and concern about a lack of oversight.

""I just think this is an exercise in nation building,"" Hawley told Fox News Thursday. ""So I'm a nationalist. I'm not in favor of nation building. I think we ought to be prioritizing American strength.""

""I'm not against the why, I'm against the how we're doing it,"" Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said Thursday. ""I'm all for giving them, you know, money every month for a while. But when you take money like we're doing, $40 billion and just throwing it out there, how do you keep up with it?""

""Underlying policy, I'm okay with,"" Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said outside the Senate floor Thursday. ""If we had actually paid for it and not borrowed the money… and when we're spending money over there, we ought to be asking the EU to match it dollar for dollar.""

Braun said that he ""probably"" would have voted for the Ukraine aid if there was a deal to pay for it and if the U.S. convinced the European Union increase its commitment to Ukraine's defense.

HAWLEY SAYS ‘ASTRONOMICAL’ $40B UKRAINE AID BILL IS EVIDENCE OF BIDEN'S 'MISPLACED PRIORITIES AND HURTS US

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., meanwhile, said he shared concerns of senators like Tuberville on fiscal responsibility. But the war in Ukraine is just too important, he said.

""We would have paid for this, we could have done it easily, we should have done that. And quite honestly we should have included Rand Paul's amendment to get the special investigator in Afghanistan on the case right away to review this,"" Johnson said. ""But the fact that we need to replenish our stocks, so that's about $10 billion at least in terms of spending on that. And we simply cannot tolerate or reward Putin's naked aggression here, you know – the atrocities, the war crimes.""

Johnson added: ""I know it's a third of the world away but I'm not going to let perfect be the enemy of what is necessary.""

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also noted that some of the money is going to the U.S. military.

""At least 25% directly to the military in the United States, some to strengthen our forces in Europe. And then a good deal of it is humanitarian,"" he said. ""And if you believe in the rule of law and if you believe that Putin could be on a slippery slope – is he going to stop in Ukraine and is he going to go in Eastern Europe, like they did before? That's something that's going to cost a lot more money.""

Paul, meanwhile, complained about the fact the bill isn't paid for at a time Americans are struggling with inflation.

""Those senators who voted to gift $40 billion to Ukraine argue that it is in our national security interest,"" Paul said on the Senate floor after the vote. ""I wonder if Americans across our country would agree if they had been shown the costs, if they had been asked to pay for it.""

Paul added: ""By my calculation, each income taxpayer in our country would need to pay $500 to support this $40 billion, which by some accounts is a down payment and will need to be replenished in about four months.""

Democrats, meanwhile, are railing against Republicans for the fact they delayed the Ukraine funding bill by a full week. ""Senator Paul’s obstruction of Ukraine funding is totally unacceptable, and only serves to strengthen Putin’s hand in the long run,"" Schumer said this week.

The Biden administration is using lunch money to hold ‘school districts hostage,’ the head of a conservative advocacy group said in response to the Department of Agriculture's announcement that it would require certain schools to allow trans students to use the bathroom of their preferred gender.

Schools awarded money from the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), an agency within USDA, must specify in their policies that discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation is prohibited, the department announced in May. It also said allegations of such discrimination must be investigated.

""What you're seeing here is really the Biden administration saying ‘you're going to do what I want or I'm going to take your lunch money,’"" Fight for Schools Executive Director Ian Prior told Fox News. ""For the federal government to come in and really tie school nutrition and school lunch programs to this radical ideology is terrifying, and it's appalling.""

FNS administers several nutrition-related programs, including WIC and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It also runs the National School Lunch Program, which provides free or low-cost lunches for children and on average fed nearly 30 million kids per day prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

PARENT'S RIGHTS GROUP CALLS OUT SCHOOLS FOR EQUITY STUDIES, REQUESTS CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATIONS

The announcement ""essentially amounts to the Biden administration holding states and local school districts hostage with school lunch money that goes to underprivileged youth in order to pass transgender non-discrimination policies,"" Prior told Fox News.

The USDA said its announcement is part of President Biden's executive order extending Title IX to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,"" the order states.

Prior told Fox News: ""I honestly have no idea how providing food to children in schools is somehow connected to transgender policies. What we see here is the Biden administration using children as pawns in this social justice, gender ideology game that they are playing.""

NEW YORK TIMES PARENT FOCUS GROUP AGREES KIDS SHOULD HEAR 'BOTH THE GOOD AND BAD' OF US HISTORY

The National School Lunch Program's free and reduced meals help ensure impoverished students receive necessary nutrition.

The LGBTQ community has historically ""faced striking economic and social disparities, such as higher rates of poverty, unemployment and nutrition insecurity,"" USDA's announcement states. Food insufficiency is ""three times as common among transgender individuals as compared to cisgender individuals.""

""Whether you are grocery shopping, standing in line at the school cafeteria, or picking up food from a food bank, you should be able to do so without fear of discrimination,"" Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services Deputy Under Secretary Stacy Dean said in a statement.

But Prior said low-income students would suffer if funding is withheld from schools, though USDA's announcement didn't state what consequences schools would face if they didn't comply.

""They discuss equity nonstop in the Biden administration,"" Prior told Fox News. ""But in reality, if you want to talk about equity or equal opportunity, the best way to do that is to make sure that every child has the opportunity to succeed.""

""One way to do that is to make sure that they are properly fed,"" he continued.

Prior also said the USDA's intended action is a ""vast overreach of federal power.""

""It is clear what they are trying to do here, which is a federal takeover of school systems throughout the country based on this radical gender ideology,"" he told Fox News.

The USDA is set to formerly propose the regulation this month. It will then be open for public comment for several months before it can be implemented.

Intense fighting continues to rage in the Donbas where Russian forces have launched a ground offensive in the attempt to completely occupy Luhansk.

Two cities stand in the way of total Russian control in the northeastern region, head of the separatist forces there told Russian media Thursday.

The cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, located right next to one another but separated by the Siverskyi Donets River, are the final holdouts for Ukrainian resistance in the region.

Head of the Russian-backed Luhansk People’s Republic, Leonid Pasechnik, said that occupying forces controlled roughly one-third of the city.

A Kurdish member of the Swedish parliament finds herself the crucial swing vote in a ""no confidence"" motion while Turkey holds out for action over Kurdish connections before supporting Sweden's NATO bid.

Kakabaveh played a pivotal role in Andersson’s election success, but now has indicated she may support the ""no confidence"" vote.

Turkey stands in the way of Sweden joining NATO as any applicant requires full support from all native members of the alliance, and Turkey has raised concern over Sweden’s cooperation with Kurdish groups.

""Our only expectation from our NATO allies is for them to show the same good faith to Turkey’s efforts aimed at protecting its own borders and reinforcing its security and stability,"" Erdogan told members of parliament Wednesday, according to a Turkish news outlet. ""We expect our allies to first understand our sensitivities and then to respect and finally, if possible, to support.""

She spent a year on the run within Turkey before moving to Sweden as a quota refugee in 1992, according to her biography. Her relationship with Turkey came into sharp focus over the past month as Sweden attempts to join NATO over security concerns following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

850,Woman marries her dog on live TV during British morning show,Jeremy Nifras,"

The love between dog and man is an unbreakable bond, but one woman recently took that connection to another level.

During Tuesday's broadcast of the British daytime television show -- ""This Morning"" -- on ITV, 49-year-old Elizabeth Hoad tied the knot with her golden retriever, Logan.

During the show, the former model told viewers she has previously struggled with love, having had four previous engagements and over 200 dates, and decided she was going to stop looking for dates altogether.

""I've completely given up. Hand on heart, I've been on all those websites,"" Hoad told the program's hosts.

She then explained that she's no longer seeking out men, after her last boyfriend turned out to be married, but found solace in her adopted pup, claiming Logan ""saved"" her.

When questioned on her ""extreme"" leap from human men to dogs, Hoad defended her decision.

""It's not just me. I meet with ten other friends a week, we go on lots of trips with our dogs, and I'm not working at the moment, so my friends are like, 'Why don't you just marry him?'"" Hoad said.

'THE BACHELORETTE' CONTESTANT JED WYATT SAYS DOG FOOD JINGLE WAS HIS 'MOST MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT'

The entire program ended with an actual wedding ceremony between Hoad and her beloved golden retriever, as she walked Logan down the aisle to a live rendition of Paul Anka's ""Puppy Love.""

The ceremony was officiated by former ""Big Brother"" contestant Alison Hammond, who gave an address filled with dog puns.

UK ""Love Island"" winner Kem Cetinay served as Logan's best man, holding his leash throughout the whole affair.

Additionally, the show's producers seemed to be having fun with what was playing out before them, with the headline ""For Better, For Woof"" being shown, as the ceremony rolled on.

851,Box of loaded guns found at Florida charter school in Parkland belong to principal,Lawrence Richard,"

Authorities found a box with loaded firearms on a school campus in Parkland, Florida, this week.

The guns were found Thursday at Somerset Academy charter school by a Broward Sheriff’s Office school resource officer, who then passed the discovery over to investigators, WSVN reported. The incident took place less than three miles from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, where a mass shooting in 2018 left 17 people dead and injured 17 others.

Following an investigation, the guns were determined to belong to the school’s principal, Geyler Castro, officials said. It was not immediately clear why the administrator brought the weapons to the school.

The school did not issue an alert or notify the parents about the incident until 24 hours later, according to the report.

After the school day ended on Friday, parents were notified that the guns were found and that they belonged to the principal.

The weapons were not intended to be carried into the school, the report said.

""No one intended to bring a weapon into the building. The box was among many items brought into the locked room from the principal’s vehicle,"" the school said, per WPLG.

A centuries-old monastery in Ukraine has been burned beyond repair after shelling by Russian artillery, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

All Saints Monastery of the Svyatogorsk Lavra was set ablaze Saturday after a series of concentrated bombardments from Russian invading forces.

The monastery is a religious institute under the protection of the Moscow Patriarchate, which has continued to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The blaze was reported by Ukrainian journalist Agath Gorski, who posted footage of the disaster to Twitter.

""The wooden All Saints Monastery of the Svyatogorsk Lavra in Donetsk region is on fire due to Russian shelling!"" Gorski said. ""The Lavra dates back to the 1500s. Second time Russia shells it. This is yet another act of Russian barbarism. For them, nothing is sacred.""

Zelenskyy posted video of the burning holy site on social media Saturday.

The monastery, located in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, is made mostly of lumber and has stood since the 16th century.

Adam made a statement on behalf of the players who opted out and cited religious beliefs.

858,"Biden admin may relax China tariffs in bid to ease inflation, commerce secretary says",Anders Hagstrom,"

President Joe Biden's administration is considering a drawdown of tariffs on Chinese goods in an effort to combat record-high inflation in the U.S.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo confirmed the potential move on Sunday, saying Biden has personally asked her team to look into the issue. Inflation in the U.S. hit a 40-year high in March and is expected to escalate in the coming months.

Some of the tariffs, imposed by former President Donald Trump, affect household goods that could be purchased more cheaply from China. Raimondo previously praised some of Trump's tariffs on China as ""very effective.""

""We are looking at it. In fact, the president has asked us on his team to analyze that. And so we are in the process of doing that for him and he will have to make that decision,"" Raimondo told CNN in an interview when asked about the issue.

MEDIA, ECONOMIC EXPERTS REACT TO APRIL INFLATION NUMBERS: ‘NOT A LOT OF COMFORT’

The potential move comes as the Biden White House searches frantically for inflation remedies. Biden released a 3-point plan to combat inflation last week, but even members of his own party criticized it as lackluster.

KUDLOW REJECTS BIDEN'S OP-ED ON ECONOMY: OBVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO GREEN REVOLUTION

""I support the president’s efforts, but we need a bolder vision and faster action,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, wrote Thursday. ""To meet the moment, Mr. Biden should convene an emergency task force empowered to lower prices and address shortages. We need an all-out mobilization, not just a few ad hoc initiatives reacting to headlines.""

Biden's plan largely calls on the Federal Reserve and Congress to handle inflation, however, and there is little executive action on Biden's part .

The Biden administration repeatedly insisted last year that inflation would be ""transitory."" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted last week that her prediction had been ""wrong.""

859,"Tucker Carlson: Yes, dead people voted in this election and Democrats helped make it happen",Tucker Carlson,"

Statement from Tucker Carlson: ""As we reported last week, dead Americans voted in this election. We shared a few examples. But on Friday, we began to learn some of the specific dead voters reported to us as deceased are in fact alive. We initially corrected this on Friday. We regret not catching it earlier. But the truth remains: dead people voted in the election.""

It's been more than a week since the final votes were cast and many of Donald Trump's 72 million voters still believe this election was fundamentally unfair. They're right about that. Democrats completely changed the way we voted in this election. Our system has never been more disorganized and it's never been more vulnerable to manipulation.

So was there voter fraud last week? We've been working on that question ever since Election Night. We've tried to be careful and precise as we report this out. In moments like this, truth matters more than ever. False allegations of fraud can cause as much damage as the fraud itself, and the last thing America needs right now is more damage.

What we're about to tell you is accurate. It's not a theory. It happened, and we can prove it. Other news organizations could prove it, too. They've simply chosen not to. The position of corporate media across the country this week has been very simple: There was no voter fraud. They say it again and again, but what exactly are they talking about? They won't tell you. So we're going to tell you right now.

Fewer than 15,000 votes separate Donald Trump from Joe Biden in the state of Georgia. It's close enough that it's worth getting specific about what happened there. Georgia's secretary of state has now confirmed there will be a hand recount of all votes cast.

GEORGIA TO MANUALLY RECOUNT EVERY BALLOT AS BIDEN LEADS BY 14K VOTES

Among those votes, auditors will find a ballot cast by a woman called Deborah Jean Christiansen. It'd be hard to find anyone who's got a bad word to say about Deborah Jean Christiansen. She was well known in her community for years as a birdwatcher, an avid gardener, a committed fan of the Georgia Bulldogs. Those who knew her were sad when she died last May. And they might be surprised to learn that even after her death, Deborah Jean Christiansen still managed to register to vote and then cast a ballot, presumably for Joe Biden.

In some ways, it's an inspiring story, the triumph of voting over death. And no one quite embodies that story like James Blalock of Covington, Ga. Mr. Blalock was a mailman for 33 years until he passed away in 2006. Fourteen years later, according to state records, he was still mailing things. James Blalock cast a ballot in last week's election. How did he do that? Maybe he was just one of those extraordinary mail carriers; neither rain nor snow nor gloom of night nor even death itself could keep him from the mail. In his case, maybe voting from the grave wasn't really fraud, it was just commitment.

Then there's Linda Kesler of Nicholson, Ga. Linda Kesler died in 2003. Seventeen years later, she was still voting in presidential elections. Edward Skwiot, of Trenton, Ga., spent his life working construction and teaching school. In his spare time, he loved bluegrass music. According to those who knew him, he played multiple instruments and enjoyed jam sessions. When he died five years ago at the age of 82, it seemed like he was gone from this world for good. But no, last week he voted for president and he wasn't the only one.

MURTAUGH: TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LATEST PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION LAWSUIT WILL 'PREVAIL'

As of right now, there aren't enough of these votes to alter the outcome. But the point is this: They are dead, but they voted anyway. The question is, how did they do that? How exactly did they cast their ballots? And the short answer is: by mail. Dead people, like any other group, tend to vote more often when you make it easier for them to vote, and this year, we made it much easier for the dead to vote. States sent ballots and registration forms to millions of people, totally unsolicited. The pretext was COVID and a public health emergency. The effect was to encourage fraud.

One 2012 study by Pew found there were close to two million dead people still on voter rolls around this country. The study also found that approximately 24 million voter registrations -- that is, one out of every eight in America -- were either no longer valid or they were significantly incorrect. Close to three million people in America had registrations in more than one state.

So what happens if you start sending ballots and registrations to lists like this? You're guaranteed to increase the amount of fraudulent voting, and that's exactly what Democrats did. Republicans, we should add, let them do it.

Take the state of Nevada, where Joe Biden is currently leading Donald Trump by fewer than 40,000 votes this year. State Democrats and their lawyers made certain that Nevada sent ballots -- not ballot applications, but actual ballots -- to every single registered voter in the state, whether they requested those ballots or not. They did this even though they were perfectly aware that more than 41,000 people who are registered to vote in Nevada haven't voted or updated their registrations in more than ten years. Many of these people are dead or gone, but they got ballots anyway.

'INGRAHAM ANGLE' EXCLUSIVE: NEVADA POLL WORKER CLAIMS SHE WITNESSED BLATANT VOTER FRAUD

One of those people was a former elementary school teacher called Rosemarie Hartle. According to her 2017 obituary, Rosemarie Hartle was ""loving, fun, sassy and sarcastic (in a fun way), beautiful, powerful, relentless, and inspiring.""

Sadly, even though she's gone, her voter registration remains. She's still on the rolls. Someone received Rosemarie Hartle's ballot in the mail and then cast it. We don't know who did this. We wish we did, because it's fraud. It's a threat to our system, and it's being hidden by a news media totally vested in a Joe Biden presidency.

We have a right to know. We have an obligation to know much more about this. But thanks to the media blackout, it is left to independent conservative sites like The Federalist to report what the rest should be reporting but are not. Thanks to The Federalist, we know that on Oct. 9, a man called Fred Stokes Jr. received an unsolicited ballot in Clark County, Nev. Three weeks later, the county received his ballot back by mail. Voting records indicate that ballot was ""completed."" Fred Stokes voted for president, but Fred Stokes had been dead for three years. He died in June 2017 at the age of 90.

In Pennsylvania, the state that made Joe Biden the president-elect, there are likely quite a few dead voters. How do we know that? Because the state told us.

BIDEN LEAD IN PENNSYLVANIA OVER TRUMP GROWS TO MORE THAN 50,000 VOTES

According to a report last December from the commonwealth's Department of the Auditor General, nearly 3,000 potentially deceased voters remained on the voter rolls. The Trump campaign says it has found evidence that some of them voted this year.

For example, on Oct. 24, Allegheny County officials mailed a ballot to one Denise Ondick. She had died two days before. Yet somehow, records show that county officials received that ballot back completed on Nov. 2.

Why did this happen? How can we prevent it from happening again? Those are the questions. The first is very simple to answer: Democrats did it. They understand that when you send mail-in ballots to an entire unverified voter roll, you can't really know who's voting. But just to make certain that fraud remained likely, Democrats filed lawsuits in Nevada to eliminate signature verification.

In 2019, well before the coronavirus pandemic, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., sponsored the Vote by Mail Act. The Vote by Mail Act demands that every state mail ballots to their entire unverified voter list. Whether you ask for it or not, whether you're alive or not, you get a ballot. There's no other way to interpret this except as Democrats abetting fraud.

This summer, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed something called the HEROES Act. It wouldn't simply have mailed absentee ballots to all voters in America. It also would have prevented states from restricting ballot harvesting in any way. That means that anyone could collect and return bundles of ballots from dead or living voters to polling stations, and there would be no oversight of this at all. That's insane, but expect more of it. Loose voting rules are too useful for the left to pass up.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

In January, Democrats could very well gain control of the United States Senate. If that happens, much will change. But one of the things that will happen is that they will pass the HEROES Act into law. Right now, they're claiming universal mail-in balloting is necessary because of coronavirus, but they're lying. They've been pushing for this very thing for years for one reason. It gives them an advantage because it increases the incidence of fraud.

If we care about our democracy, we must demand clean and honest voting regardless of the outcome. The system is what we must protect. Sending ballots to entire unverified voter lists unsolicited gets you dead people voting. And what does that do? It puts us where we are now: Cynical, distrustful, withdrawn. If you want to run a democracy, you need one thing above all: Social trust. If you want people to have social trust, if you want them to believe in the system, it's not enough to yell at them on television and tell them that they must believe. You have to create a system that is worth believing in.

The CDC raised its alert level for monkeypox to level 2 on Monday, recommending that travelers wear masks, among other health measures.

While not on the level of COVID-19, monkeypox has spread across the globe out of Africa since March. Monkeypox symptoms begin as relatively flu-like but soon expand to the swelling of lymph nodes and a rash across the body and face. Ultimately, painful lesions form on rash areas, leaving severe scarring.

""Cases of monkeypox have been reported in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia,"" the CDC wrote in its alert.

""Some cases were reported among men who have sex with men. Some cases were also reported in people who live in the same household as an infected person,"" it added.

866,"Hunter Biden is 'biological and legal father' of child with former stripper, judge rules",Gregg Re,"

Hunter Biden, the son of presidential candidate Joe Biden, is the ""biological and legal father"" of a child he fathered with an ex-stripper, an Arkansas judge ruled Tuesday, contradicting the younger Biden's previous denials that he had any role in the pregnancy.

In an order establishing paternity, Independence County, Ark., Circuit Judge Holly Meyer noted that the results of DNA tests indicated Biden was the father ""with near scientific certainty,"" and instructed the Arkansas Department of Health to issue a birth certificate listing Biden as the father of 29-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' child.

Roberts, who The New York Post reported was a stripper at a Washington, D.C., club that Biden patronized, received ""primary physical and legal custody"" of the child. In previous filings, Roberts told the court that Hunter Biden ""had no involvement in the child's life since the child's birth, never interacted with the child, never parented the child,"" and ""could not identify the child out of a photo lineup.""

Biden “shall have visitation with the child as agreed between the parties,” Judge Meyer ruled.

In a separate order, Meyer also dismissed attempts by a private investigation firm D&A Investigations to join the case, saying the company's pleadings were frivolous and that future attempts might incur a contempt citation.

D&A claimed Biden was the subject of multiple criminal investigations and had been involved in a $156 million counterfeiting scheme, which Biden's legal team said were transparently false attempts to get media attention. Additionally, D&A said it had linked Biden to an identity-theft scheme, but provided no evidence -- and, the firm didn't explain why its filings were relevant to the paternity case.

Still, the paternity disputed has presented headaches for the elder Biden ever since a court filing showed that DNA results indicated he was now a grandfather. Joe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter on camera when asked about that development in November.

""I'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,"" Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked.

""No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,"" Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.

""Only you would ask that,"" Biden said. ""You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy.""

868,Illegal immigrant acquitted in Kate Steinle's 2015 shooting death gets time served for federal weapons charges,Paul Best,"

Jose Inez Garcia-Zarate, an illegal immigrant who was acquitted of murder in the 2015 shooting death of Kate Steinle, was sentenced to the seven years he has already spent behind bars on Monday after pleading guilty to federal weapons charges earlier this year.

The 51-year-old Mexican national will now be transported to Texas to face charges for failing to report his location to immigration officials in a separate case.

Kathryn ""Kate"" Steinle, 32, was walking with her father and a family friend on a San Francisco pier in July 2015 when she was struck in the back by a bullet and killed.

Garcia-Zarate, who had been deported from the U.S. five times, acknowledged holding the gun that killed Steinle but said it accidentally fired when he picked it up from underneath a bench. The gun had been stolen from a Bureau of Land Management ranger's car about a week before the shooting.

Steinle's death ignited a nationwide debate over immigration during the 2016 presidential election, with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and other Republican lawmakers blaming the incident on San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city.

29 GOP SENATORS JOIN JOHNSON, BIGGS IN RESOLUTION TO REPEAL BIDEN'S ASYLUM RULE

A San Francisco Superior Court jury acquitted Garcia-Zarate of murder in 2017 but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a weapon. The conviction on the state weapons charge was overturned on appeal in 2019.

The federal weapons charges had been pending for five years amid concerns about Garcia-Zarate's ability to stand trial. Two doctors have diagnosed him with schizophrenia, but the Bureau of Prisons ""restored the defendant to competency"" last June, U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria said.

As part of the guilty plea to federal weapons charges, Garcia-Zarate admitted that he was on the San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015, and in possession of a pistol loaded with eight rounds.

""If you return to this country again and you are back in front of me, I will not spare you. Let this be your last warning: do not return to this country,"" Judge Chhabria said at the hearing on Monday.

871,Armed suspect arrested near Justice Kavanaugh home identified,Danielle Wallace,"

The armed California man arrested near the Maryland home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Wednesday morning has been identified as Nicholas John Roske, law enforcement sources tell Fox News.

Roske of Simi Valley, California, was carrying a gun, knife and pepper spray when arrested and had made violent threats against Kavanaugh, sources said. Roske was picked up on a nearby street after calling police on 911 to report himself.

A criminal complaint obtained by Fox News shows that Roske is being charged with attempting to murder a United States Supreme Court Justice. He is scheduled to have a first appearance in federal court in Maryland Wednesday afternoon.

SUPREME COURT DOESN'T RULE ON CASE THAT COULD OVERTURN ROE V. WADE, EXTENDING WAIT FOR BLOCKBUSTER DECISION

He told officers that he wanted ""to give his life purpose"" and purchased the gun and other items for the purpose of breaking into Kavanaugh’s home and killing the justice and then himself. Roske admitted in a second interview with the FBI of his intent to kill Kavanaugh and himself, according to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.

Roske told detectives that ""he was upset about the leak of a recent Supreme Court draft decision regarding the right to an abortion as well as the recent school shooting in Uvalde, Texas,"" and believed Kavanaugh ""would side with Second Amendment decisions that would loosen gun control laws,"" according to the affidavit.

At approximately 1:05 a.m. Wednesday, two U.S. Marshals saw an individual, later identified as Roske, dressed in black clothing and carrying a backpack and a suitcase, get out of a taxicab that had stopped in front of Kavanaugh’s Montgomery County home. The individual looked at the two marshals standing outside their parked vehicle and turned to walk down the street, the affidavit says.

Shortly after, the Montgomery County Emergency Communication Center fielded a call from Roske, who identified himself and told the call taker he ""was having suicidal thoughts and had a firearm in his suitcase."" Roske also told the call taker ""he came from California to kill a specific United States Supreme Court Justice,"" the affidavit says.

MCCONNELL SLAMS HOUSE DEMOCRATS FOR BLOCKING SUPREME COURT SECURITY BILL

Montgomery County Police Department officers were dispatched to the location near Kavanaugh’s residence, where they encountered Roske still on the phone with the emergency operator. He was taken into custody without incident and a backpack and suitcase in his possession were seized.

A black tactical chest rig and tactical knife, Glock 17 pistol with two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crowbar, pistol light, duct tape, hiking boots with padding on the outside of the soles, and other items were found in his suitcase and backpack.

U.S. Marshals and the Montgomery County Police Department are handling the investigation.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland addressed the incident at a press conference previously planned to provide an update on the federal investigation into the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school shooting.

""This kind of behavior, it's obviously behavior that we will not tolerate,"" Garland said. ""Threats of violence and actual violence against the justices of course strike at the heart of our democracy. We will do everything we can to prevent them and hold people who do them accountable.""

Garland said that he accelerated the protection of all the justices residences 24/7 and met with the marshal of the court last month. He said he also convened a meeting with the marshal, as well as with the deputy FBI director, the U.S. Marshal Service and with the Justice Department’s own law enforcement prosecutors ""to ensure every data protection available.""

SPONSOR OF SUPREME COURT PROTECTION BILL SLAMS DEM ‘OBSTRUCTION’ FOLLOWING ROSKE ARREST

""Just yesterday, I met with Judge Salas and Judge Sullivan, the Judicial Security Committee of the Judicial Conference, and assured them of our complete support for their efforts with respect to judicial security.""

""At approximately 1:50 a.m. today, a man was arrested near Justice Kavanaugh’s residence,"" Patricia McCabe, spokeswoman for the Supreme Court, said in a statement to Fox News. ""The man was armed and made threats against Justice Kavanaugh. He was transported to Montgomery County Police 2nd District.""

The arrest came hours before the Supreme Court revealed Wednesday that it has not ruled in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, prolonging the wait for its opinion which is expected to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a new bulletin Tuesday warning of a ""heightened threat environment"" over the next several months as they monitor both risks of domestic terrorism and foreign adversaries looking to sow U.S. societal division and inspire violence.

While citing other recent major events, including mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, the DHS update reiterated from its previous bulletin that individuals both for and against abortion online have advocated for violence against government, religious and reproductive health care personnel and facilities in response to the high-profile U.S. Supreme Court case.

Part of the concern from the justices and others is the heated rhetoric from elected officials, over the Supreme Court’s rulings, which some say can exacerbate tensions among the general public.

In March 2020, when the high court heard oral arguments in a case over Louisiana’s abortion clinic access restrictions, there was a rally outside the court from abortion rights supporters. Among the speakers, then Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

By the time this is published the average gas price in Texas will have likely set a new record high. At the time of writing, it was just seven cents off the old record and had risen 60 cents from the previous week.

President Joe Biden is looking for every excuse to ignore the powers he has but refuses to use to help bring prices down.

""Can’t do much right now,"" he told reporters. ""Russia is responsible.""

GAS PRICES: BIDEN RELIES ON NYT FACT CHECK, WAPO OP-ED TO DEFLECT GOP CRITICISM OF ENERGY POLICY

He accused oil companies of exercising ""excessive price increases or padding profits"" and exploiting American consumers.

But the trends are clear. After gas prices crashed following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, they stabilized around $2.20 through 2020.

prev Image 3 of 3

From the beginning of 2021 through the middle of May of that year, prices spiked from $2.25 to over $3.00. From there, gas prices rose steadily hitting $3.40 in mid-November, dipping slightly as the country dealt with the Omicron variant, only to continue upward for most of 2022.

All that occurred before Russia invaded Ukraine. The president has only himself and his opposition to domestic energy production to blame.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In the first week of his new administration, the president signed an executive order to ""pause"" oil and gas leasing on federal land. By the end of the year the Interior Department was recommending new regulations and fees that would drive up the cost of onshore drilling and dissuade companies from leasing the land all together.

In his second month in office, Biden reinstated the ""social cost of carbon"" to $51 per metric ton from $8, which is largely a made-up figure but allows the government to regulate – and prevent – domestic production much more aggressively.

The administration was begrudgingly forced into auctioning offshore leases last year, but only after a federal judge said the initial ban was illegal. Yet the ban received new life in January when a D.C. District Court judge invalidated the entire sale. There are no signs Biden will appeal the ruling.

BIDEN CLAIMS ‘INFLATION IS LARGELY THE FAULT OF PUTIN,’ NOT DEMOCRATIC SPENDING

In the summer, Biden reversed efforts to reduce the time it takes to build infrastructure projects, like energy production facilities, as well as reimposing methane restrictions that provide no environmental benefit but do raise the cost of creating energy here at home.

The president has only himself and his opposition to domestic energy production to blame.

Oddly, Biden is pretending to care about increasing oil supply by suggesting he would ease sanctions on Venezuela, begging Saudi Arabia to open the spigot, and seeking a deal with Iran. Meanwhile, the Keystone pipeline, a project in conjunction with our friendly neighbors to the north, remains canceled. Keystone would increase capacity by 500,000 barrels of oil per day.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Biden has apparently submitted his early entry to PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year contest: ""It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production.""

That’s undeniably false. And it is certainly true that his administration is not actively pursuing an increase in domestic energy production, which, unlike war in Ukraine or running an oil company, is something he does control.

Announcing today that the U.S. will make every effort to increase domestic oil supply would send the right signals to the market and start to put downward pressure on prices. Biden could immediately instruct his administration to prioritize lease sale approvals and remove the self-imposed regulatory barriers causing unnecessary delays. The president could approve pending pipeline and LNG export permits, and suspend the antiquated Jones Act that prohibits domestic port-to-port shipping.

A Michigan police officer who fatally shot a Black man in the back of the head as he was on the ground during a traffic stop was charged Thursday with murder.

Grand Rapids Officer Christopher Schurr faces a second-degree murder charge in the April 4 killing of 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya, Prosecutor Chris Becker said. The shooting was recorded by a bystander. He turned himself in and is slated to appear in court Friday.

""The death was not justified or excused ... by self defense,"" Becker said.

The shooting began when Schurr, who is White, pulled Lyoya over because his license plate did match the vehicle. About a minute into the stop, Lyoya began running when he was asked to provide his driver's license. Schurr quickly caught up to him and both men struggled on the ground.

Schurr fired the fatal shot while Lyoya was on the ground, demanding that the 26-year-old refugee from Congo ""let go"" of the officer's Taser. Becker said he consulted experts from outside Michigan about the use of force in the case. Schurr, a 7-year veteran of the police force, has not publicly commented on the deadly incident.

Across the state in Detroit, Peter Lyoya watched the televised announcement of the charges with his lawyer, Ven Johnson, and said he was pleased with the decision.

""We strongly believed there was no justice in America, until today,"" Peter Lyoya said. ""What I want is the final justice for my son.""

Black community activists weeks ago had accused Becker, a Republican, of being too close to police and urged him to give the case to the Michigan attorney general, a Democrat, to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. But the prosecutor declined.

The shooting turned into an immediate crisis for police Chief Eric Winstrom, who was a commander in Chicago before taking charge in Grand Rapids early in March. Over Becker's objections, he released video of the encounter from four different sources on April 13.

""I was supposed to be taking Ethan to college visits on Monday. His first college visit,"" Liming told Fox News Digital. ""He wanted to become a lawyer, and he wanted to fight for people who weren't able to fight for themselves. He would have been fighting for the same people who murdered him. He cared for everybody.""

ETHAN LIMING DEATH: AKRON POLICE SAY TEEN, 17, WAS ‘ASSAULTED’ FOLLOWING WATER GUN INCIDENT

Akron Police Department Chief Stephen Mylett described Ethan's killing as a ""senseless act of violence"" during a Wednesday press conference.

On the night of June 2, a Thursday, at 10:49 p.m., police received a call regarding a fight in a parking lot next to an elementary school basketball court. The court, which is apparently lit at all hours of the night, according to Liming, is part of a public elementary school in Akron supported by the LeBron James Family Foundation called the "" I Promise School .""

Officers arrived within three minutes of the first 911 call and found an Ethan laying on the ground in the parking lot. Authorities attempted life-saving measures but were unable to revive the teenager, and he was pronounced dead at the scene, Mylett said.

The fight supposedly began with a water bead gun.

DHS WARNS OF ‘HEIGHTENED THREAT ENVIRONMENT,' VIOLENT MONTHS AHEAD

Ethan and three of his friends drove into the parking lot of the basketball court that night so that they could text their friends to make plans for the remainder of the evening, according to the elder Liming.

Two of his friends got out of the vehicle and started shooting a toy ""SplatRBall"" gun, which is described as a rechargeable, full-auto and semi-auto water bead gun. The water beads explode when they hit a target. The toy gun is listed as $68 on Walmart's website.

Ethan's father said his son has hit him with the toy gun before, and the gel bullets feel like a ""rubber band snap.""

The two boys playing with the water bead gun then began shooting toward a group of four individuals playing on the basketball court. Eventually, an altercation ensued between the four individuals on the basketball court and the four boys in the parking lot, including Ethan.

Three occupants of the vehicle, including Ethan, were assaulted.

""My son got out [of the vehicle] to try and let everybody know that it wasn't serious. They were just goofing around, and a fight ensued. One man attacked him, then a second man attacked him, and he was trying to fight for his life. And a third guy came in and knocked him to the ground, and they slowly beat him to death. They crushed his skull,"" Liming said.

Authorities are still trying to nail down suspects in the case, though no new information about the perpetrators had been released as of Friday afternoon. Ethan's friends who were also beaten that night are ""pretty traumatized"" and ""scared"" after what happened, Liming explained.

He is begging anyone with information about the incident to have the courage to come forward.

""He had a very bright future. He was well-loved. And his friends have been so wonderfully supportive to his little brother,"" Ethan's father said. ""He was with a really good group of guys, and they were out trying to have fun, trying to be teenagers, and they ran into some people I wish they have never met in their lives.""

Liming believes the perpetrators may have targeted his son because he was the tallest in the group, standing at 6 ft., 1 in. Ethan's friends ""did everything they could"" to try to save their friend's life, but to no avail, he said.

Ethan's killing is one of many acts of violence that have left teenagers across the U.S. dead in recent weeks as the school year comes to a close.

Last month, Connecticut high schooler James McGrath was fatally stabbed outside a house party; his suspected juvenile killer, Raul Valle, was released on $2 million bond. In Baltimore, 17-year-old Jasmine Brunson was fatally shot at an after-prom party; police are still searching for the suspect in his death as of Friday. In the past week, teenage boys were shot to death in Phoenix; Chicago; Washington, D.C. and other major cities across the U.S.

Mylett said the ""entire country is dealing with a plague of violence,"" and ""Akron is not immune from that.""

Police in Ohio are now offering a $30,000 reward for information surrounding the death of Ethan Liming, a 17-year-old who died last week in an elementary school parking lot after becoming involved in an altercation that police believe was sparked by the use of a water gun.

The incident happened around 10:46 p.m. on Thursday, June 2, near the basketball courts of the I Promise School in Akron, according to police. Officials say Liming died after suffering a blunt force head injury and as of Friday, no arrests have been made.

""Ethan Liming was a young man with a full life ahead of him, and that bright future was senselessly taken from him in the most brutal of ways,"" Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan said in a statement. ""This type of violence in our community has ripple effects that touch each person, including myself, in profound ways, and I know the city of Akron is in mourning because of this tremendous loss.""

Akron Police are still investigating Liming’s death, but said ""in the moments leading up to the incident, one or more occupants in [Liming’s] vehicle were riding around the surrounding area shooting a SPLATRBALL Water Bead Blaster at objects and possibly unsuspecting people.

""The collective actions of the teens in the car appear to have unfortunately provoked the altercation,"" it added.

Akron Police Chief Stephen Mylett said during a press conference Wednesday that Liming was found unresponsive when police arrived and efforts by first responders to save him proved unsuccessful. Liming was pronounced dead at the scene.

In describing the events unfold, Mylett said at least two individuals in Liming’s vehicle got outside and began firing the water gun toward four people playing basketball on the school’s court.

That group ran away before all six eventually converged back at the vehicle, where Liming was ""assaulted and a fight ensues,"" according to Mylett.

883,"California in crisis, Newsom focused on slavery reparations",Deroy Murdock,"

California is infested with violent crime, failing schools, America's highest gasoline prices (approaching $10.00 per gallon in points north!), and a 1,200-year-record drought. Al fresco vagrants, too many of them mentally ill and/or addicted to drugs and alcohol, populate ramshackle tent cities that breed lawlessness, squalor, and chaos. Rampant wildfires literally burn the Golden State to a crisp and pump its skies full of carbon dioxide – a poison worse than cyanide, according to the high priests in the Church of the Green New Deal.

So, amid such monumental challenges, where have California's leaders focused lately?

Slavery reparations!

Radical-Left Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom should spend his time and energy on any or all of these urgent matters, several of which routinely kill people. Instead, Newsom and his Wokistani brethren in Sacramento are sifting through a 500-page report on reparations that state lawmakers ordered via legislation that the governor signed in 2020.

CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL CHALLENGER SLAMS STATE'S 'CRISIS OF CHAOS': WE NEED 'LAW AND ORDER'

This huge study plopped onto officials' desks on June 1. It is ""an organizing tool for people not only in California but across the U.S.,"" Task Force Chair Kamilah Moore said. Legislators expect a ""comprehensive reparations scheme"" next year.

All of this will devour plenty of official attention that should be aimed at keeping Californians from getting bankrupted, murdered, or incinerated. Rather than unite Californians, ensuing discussions likely will divide Golden State residents along racial lines and perhaps within racial lines.

California did not belong to the Confederacy and was not a slave state. Nonetheless, Democrats are desperate to plunge America's most populous jurisdiction into a corrosive debate over slavery. Go figure.

I was born in Los Angeles in 1963 and reared there throughout the glorious 1960s, '70s, and early '80s. It's impossible to imagine a better place and time in which to grow up. As Paul Simon once sang, I was ""born at the right time.""

I headed east to Washington, D.C. and Georgetown University in 1982, but flew home every Christmas and summer. Even after moving to Manhattan in 1987 for business school at New York University, and staying here ever since, I still frequently visit my birth state.

Through most of those wonder years, Californians of all colors generally got along. Tensions flared up badly during race riots in Watts and after the Rodney King verdict.

But otherwise, southern California was a relentlessly sunny, vibrant, and prosperous place with incomparable weather, a mellow vibe, and a sincere effort by most people who at least tried to bridge ethnic differences and share that peaceful, easy feeling. We did not tear ourselves apart over slavery, which ended 98 years before I hatched, thousands of miles due east of California's Southland.

My sainted mother and father – alive and well today at their respective ages of 83 and 90 – came from Costa Rica. Rather than dash across the southern frontier, as is all the rage these days, they arrived legally, with passports and visas. How touching.

I am sure that my parents and other black Californians from Latin America, the Caribbean, and contemporary Africa must wonder why Sacramento Democrats hope to spend their tax dollars to pay reparations to the descendants of slaves whom their families never owned.

Black taxpayers funding reparations for other black people? And people ask me why I don't write fiction.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Hispanics and Asians whose great, great, great, grandparents lived in Ecuador, Korea, and nations even farther flung – while blacks toiled in Dixie for free – must ponder why they are being dragged into debates and potential tax-funded financial transfers that have nothing to do with them.

White Californians in the tens of millions belong to families who held no slaves, spent the antebellum years in Europe, bled to death at Antietam battling the Confederacy, or were themselves victims of feudalism, indentured servitude, and even slave labor. ""Why are fingers being pointed at us?"" they surely ask.

Rather than rip California a new San Andreas Fault, the best thing the Golden State can do for black people is encourage widespread school choice and high educational standards. Charter schools, magnet schools, vouchers, homeschooling, and other options increase the odds that poor black children will learn and prosper. For those so dedicated, this will provide boatloads more social justice for black Californians than watching Gavin Newsom and his minions steer their state along treacherous cliffside roads while staring into the rear-view mirror at ancient ugliness.

887,Coal: the cleanest energy source there is?,Gene Koprowski,"

next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Researchers have discovered a stunning new process that takes the energy from coal without burning it -- and removes virtually all of the pollution.

The clean coal technique was developed by scientists at The Ohio State University, with just $5 million in funding from the federal government, and took 15 years to achieve.

“We’ve been working on this for more than a decade,” Liang-Shih Fan, a chemical engineer and director of OSU’s Clean Coal Research Laboratory, told FoxNews.com, calling it a new energy conversion process. “We found a way to release the heat from coal without burning.”

The process removes 99 percent of the pollution from coal, which some scientists link to global warming. Coal-burning power plants produced about one-third of the nation’s carbon dioxide total in 2010, or about 2.3 billion metric tons, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

'We found a way to release the heat from coal without burning.' — Liang-Shih Fan, a chemical engineer and director of OSU’s Clean Coal Research Laboratory

Retrofitting them with the new process would be costly, but it would cut billions of tons of pollution.

“In the simplest sense, conventional combustion is a chemical reaction that consumes oxygen and produces heat,” Fan fold FoxNews.com. “Unfortunately, it also produces carbon dioxide, which is difficult to capture and bad for the environment.”

And simply put, the new process isn't.

Heating, Not Burning, Coal

Fan discovered a way to heat coal, using iron-oxide pellets for an oxygen source and containing the reaction in a small, heated chamber from which pollutants cannot escape. The only waste product is therefore water and coal ash -- no greenhouse gases. As an added benefit, the metal from the iron-oxide can be recycled.

“Oxidation” is the chemical combination of a substance with oxygen. Contrast this with old-fashioned, coal-fired plants, which use oxygen to burn the coal and generate heat. This in turn makes steam, which turns giant turbines and sends power down electric lines.

The main by-product of that old process — carbon dioxide, known chemically as CO2 — is released through smokestacks into the earth’s atmosphere.

Fan’s process, called “coal-direct chemical looping,” has been proven in a small scale lab at OSU. The next step is to take it to a larger test facility in Alabama, and Fan believes the technology can be commercialized and used to power an energy plant within five to 10 years, if all goes smoothly. The technology generated 25 kilowatts of thermal energy in current tests; the Alabama site will generate 250 kilowatts.

Can Coal Ever Be 'Clean'?

Some environmentalists are skeptical of the technology, and of the idea of clean coal in general.

“Claiming that coal is clean because it could be clean -- if a new technically unproven and economically dubious technology might be adopted -- is like someone claiming that belladonna is not poisonous because there is a new unproven safe pill under development,” wrote Donald Brown at liberal think tank Climate Progress.

Yet the federal Department of Energy believes that the process can create 20 megawatts to 50 megawatts by 2020, said Jared Ciferno, the agency’s director of coal and power-production research and development, in a statement.

The government plans to continue to support the project, as well as the concept of ""clean coal"" in general.

Meanwhile, Fan is exploring the possibility of establishing a start-up company and licensing the process to utilities, and has the potential to patent 35 different parts of the process.

Other scientists and experts are enthused about the prospects for this technology.

Yan Feng with Argonne National Laboratory's Environmental Science Division, Climate Research Section, called it “an advancement in chemical engineering. “It is very important that we act on CO2 capturing and sequestration as well as emission controls of other warming agents like tropospheric ozone and black carbon.""

Adds a spokesman for Kingsport, Tenn.-based Eastman Chemical Company, a global Fortune 250 chemical manufacturer that works in clean energy, “researchers continue to uncover innovative ways to use coal efficiently/sustainably.”

Concludes Dawei Wang, a research associate at OSU, the technology's potential benefits even go beyond the environment and issues like sustainability.

""The plant could really promote our energy independence. Not only can we use America's natural resources such as Ohio coal, but we can keep our air clean and spur the economy with jobs,” he said.",https://www.foxnews.com
891,Putin carries poop case when he travels outside Moscow to hide possible health problems: Report,Peter Aitken,"

Koffler explained that Putin likely fears anyone using the excrement as evidence of some kind of weakness in the Russian president’s health.

""While there is much speculation about Putin’s having a terminal illness, the intelligence about his health is inconclusive,"" Koffler said. ""Short of a terminal illness, Putin will likely be Russia’s president at least through 2024 and possibly through 2036, given that his popularity has skyrocketed after the invasion of Ukraine.""

Putin has an 81% approval rating despite scattered protests since the start of the invasion of Ukraine.

Reports of Putin’s health have circulated since before the invasion began, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov just last week denying that the Russian president was seriously ill.

TEXAS REPORTS FIRST CASE OF MONKEYPOX AS NATIONWIDE TALLY GROWS TO 35

On Monday, the Centers for DIsease Control and Prevention raised its alert level for monkeypox to level 2, warning people to practice ""enhanced precautions.""

People normally become infected with the monkeypox virus through contact with the skin lesions or bodily fluids of infected animals or humans or through contact with materials contaminated with the virus.

Although the majority of new monkeypox cases have been seen in gay or bisexual men, experts caution that anyone is at potential risk.

HUNDREDS OF MONKEYPOX CASES REPORTED WORLDWIDE: WHO

Monkeypox, which is related to smallpox, has milder symptoms that include fever, chills, rash and aches, before lesions develop.

Officials say the risk to the American public is low, but they are taking steps to assure people that medical measures are in place to deal with the growing problem.

A two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, is approved for monkeypox in the U.S.

The U.S. government has 72,000 Jynneos doses, and will get 300,000 more doses from its manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, over the next several weeks, said Dawn O’Connell, who oversees the government’s stockpile of emergency vaccines and treatments.

893,"After alleged plot to kill Kavanaugh, Republicans targeted in 2017 shooting fear more assassination attempts",Houston Keene,"

FIRST ON FOX: For Republican congressmen targeted in the 2017 mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice, the revelation that a man was arrested and charged with attempting to murder Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has sparked fears that the charged political climate could lead to more assassination attempts.

James T. Hodgkinson, a far-left former volunteer on Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, opened fire on a group of Republican lawmakers in June 2017 as they practiced for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise , R-La., was shot and critically injured during the attack, requiring surgeries to save his life.

Fresh off a flight from California, police arrested 26-year-old California man Nicholas Roske in the early hours Wednesday after he took a cab to Kavanaugh's Maryland house with a gun in order to kill the justice, authorities said.

For Republicans who survived the baseball shooting, the alleged attempt to kill Kavanaugh, and the surrounding political climate bring back memories – and fears – of the 2017 attack.

ACTIVISTS VOW TO CONTINUE PROTESTING AT JUSTICES’ HOUSES, DESPITE ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO KILL KAVANAUGH AT HOME

""For weeks, Democrat leaders from President Biden’s White House to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer encouraged dangerous protests against Supreme Court justices, including at their homes, to illegally threaten and intimidate them in an attempt to change the outcome of a court decision,"" Scalise told Fox News Digital.

""How many more times do we need to see political violence motivated by threatening rhetoric before Democrats stop encouraging and condoning this kind of dangerous behavior?"" the Republican whip continued.

""Rather than investigating parents at school board meetings as ‘domestic terrorists,’ President Biden’s Justice Department should look into the actual dangerous violence coming from the radical left that continues to put the lives of people in danger for their political views,"" he added.

MEDIA, DEMOCRATIC RHETORIC TOWARD KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT UNDER SCRUTINY AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican who was also present at the 2017 shooting, said the protesters who gather outside of Supreme Court justices’ houses ""should be arrested.""

""As a victim of politically motivated violence, I’ve continually spoken out against threats made against our Supreme Court justices and elected officials – something the Biden administration can’t even condemn, let alone acknowledge,"" Paul said. ""Those who are threatening these justices and disrupting neighborhoods during the dead of night should be arrested.""

Texas Rep. Roger Williams, who was also present at the baseball field that day, told Fox News Digital that every ""American should be outraged by this deranged individual attempting to murder a sitting Supreme Court justice.""

""His arrest brought flashbacks to that horrific day in 2017 when the Republican baseball team was gunned down by an angry Bernie Sanders supporter,"" Williams said. ""From someone that experienced this sort of political violence firsthand, these incidents have demonstrated what can happen if we keep treating our political opponents as enemies.""

Williams said he is ""deeply concerned that these types of motivated attacks will continue to happen with Senate Majority Leader Schumer telling his supporters that Justice Kavanaugh will ‘pay the price’ if he simply does his job, or with Maxine Waters encouraging people to ‘get more confrontational’ with people that they disagree with politically.""

""Instead of acting swiftly, Nancy Pelosi just adjourned the House for the weekend without providing additional security for sitting Supreme Court justices,"" he continued. ""I will continue to pray for the country and we must do all that we can to ensure political differences do not lead to violence against our government officials.""

Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told Fox News Digital on Thursday that there is always a ""component"" of American society that believes trying to kill political opposition and take other violent political action ""is the right thing to do.""

""But I am concerned about what is just going on with the nature of violent acts and especially murderous acts that we're seeing,"" Wenstrup said, adding that ""there is something changing in our society and not for the better.""

""And if we aren't honest with ourselves and we don't start looking at what is different and why these types of things are taking place, then I don't think we're going to solve anything,"" the Ohio Republican continued. ""We're not going to solve anything with these laws.""

Wenstrup said he believes there are multiple factors affecting the root of the problem and hopes American ""law enforcement is out in front and trying to off any potential threats before they happen.""

The Ohio Republican also said lawmakers who were on the field that fateful June day five years ago do not hold Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., responsible for the actions of his supporter, saying the shooter as well as the people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 are ""responsible for their own actions.""

Wenstrup also took to the House floor to say that only ""by the grace of God were 20 or more of my Republican colleagues and our staff not killed by a crazed terrorist wielding a gun on that baseball field in Alexandria"" and that the situation ""is not a theoretical exercise for many of us on this side of the aisle.""

""What are you doing? Take back the Senate! You've got guns. Use them,"" Graham told Capitol police, according to an extensive report from the Washington Post , which described Graham as ""irate"" that senators were forced to leave their chambers during the storming of the Capitol.

""We give you guns for a reason,"" he said. ""Use them."" The Washington Post stated the quotes were based on an unnamed Republican senator with knowledge of the incident.

They should have been challenged, warning shots should have been fired and lethal force should have been used once they’d penetrated the seat of government.

He also pointed to the rioting at the courthouse in Portland, Oregon, in 2020, saying violence ""gets worse"" if such behavior is not addressed and managed by the legal system and local leaders.

Dozens of masked men, suspected of being tied to a White nationalist group, were arrested near an Idaho pride event on Saturday after they were found packed in the back of a U-Haul truck.

Couer d'Alene police confirmed in a press briefing that 31 individuals from a variety of states were inside the U-Haul after it was stopped by local and Idaho State Police several blocks from the pride event on Saturday afternoon.

The several dozen men inside the truck wore khakis, navy blue shirts and beige hats with white balaclavas covering their faces and police say that some of them wore patches that identified with Patriot Front, a White supremacist group, according to some civil rights organizations.

The men had what appeared to be a homemade riot shield and some protective equipment, KTVB reported. It was not immediately clear why the truck was stopped.

Videos of the arrest posted on social media show the men kneeling on the grass with their hands zip-tied behind their backs.

901,"Murdered University of Utah student was extorted before her killing, police say",Samuel Chamberlain,"

A University of Utah student who police say was murdered by her ex-boyfriend told officers she wired $1,000 to an account earlier this month to prevent the release of ""compromising pictures"" of the pair, investigators said Thursday.

University Police Chief Dale Brophy told reporters that Lauren McCluskey, 21, reported the extortion to his officers on Oct. 13, nine days before she was found shot dead outside an on-campus dormitory. The suspect in her murder, 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, was found dead that same evening of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a Salt Lake City church.

Brophy said that McCluskey had ended her relationship with Rowland on Oct. 9 after she discovered that he had lied to her about his age and was a registered sex offender. McCluskey initially declined police assistance in dealing with Rowland, but later reported receiving numerous emails and messages using different names trying to lure her to locations in addition to the extortion attempt. Investigators now believe the messages all came from Rowland, who Brophy called a master manipulator.

""If his lips were moving, he was lying,"" Brophy said of Rowland. ""I don't think he told the truth to anybody based on our investigation.""

Rowland was spotted on surveillance video at various locations around the University of Utah's campus during the weekend before McCluskey's murder. Authorities believe he was trying to confront her. Hours before the killing, Rowland was in McCluskey's dorm building socializing with some of her friends. He later confronted McCluskey in the building parking lot, dragged her into a car he had driven to campus, and shot her multiple times.

After shooting McCluskey, Rowland was picked up on campus by a woman he met online. They went to dinner, visited the state Capitol and went to her apartment where Rowland took a shower.

The woman later called police when she saw photos of the man being sought for the campus shooting.

Later that night, after the woman dropped Rowland at a coffee shop, police tracked him to the church where he killed himself.

Rowland got the gun by telling an acquaintance that his girlfriend wanted to learn to shoot.

Brophy said it appears the woman who picked up Rowland on campus and the person who loaned him the gun had been duped and will not face charges.

Police knew Rowland was a sex offender but not that he was on parole, Brophy said. He added that police didn't start the formal extortion investigation until six days after her Oct. 13 report due to workload issues.

Kaitlin Felsted, a spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Corrections, said police didn't make parole officers aware of the complaint filed by McCluskey.

In the early stages of the investigation, officers didn't have enough information to pass on to any other law enforcement, Brophy said, adding that there were no indications from McCluskey that Rowland was threatening physical violence.

University of Utah president Ruth Watkins said outside investigations are being launched to assess campus security and police protocols to determine if improvements can be made to prevent future shootings.

Watkins said so far she has found no mistakes in how police handled the case. Brophy said he welcomes the reviews.

UNIVERSITY OF UTAH STUDENT WAS ON PHONE WITH PARENTS BEFORE DEADLY SHOOTING

Earlier in the day, Gov. Gary Herbert said corrections and parole officials had launched investigations into the handling of the case.

""Clearly in hindsight, we're going to say, 'You should have done this, you should have done that,'"" Herbert said during his monthly televised news conference at KUED-TV

He noted, however, ""You never know when these things are going to occur.""

Rowland was paroled in April when he told the parole board that he was a changed man after being a peer leader in prison had helped him tap into his empathy and learn to follow the rules.

He spent nearly a decade in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to trying to lure an underage girl online and attempted sex abuse charges, according to court records.

After he was charged, a woman came forward to report he had sexually assaulted her after a separate online meeting a few days earlier.

Rowland, a native of New York, was twice sent back to prison for parole violations that included possessing pornography and failure to complete therapy.

MARRIED COUPLE FOUND DEAD AT INDIANA HOME IDENTIFIED AS TEACHERS

He blamed his ""thinking errors"" for the actions that kept sending him back in prison, according to recordings of parole hearings from 2010 to 2018 released this week by the Utah Board of Parole and Pardons.

Rowland said at a hearing in 2012 that he was a womanizer who manipulated women to get what he wanted.

Brophy offered the same assessment. He said McCluskey met Rowland last month at a bar where he was working security and started dating him. He visited her often in her dorm and made friends with other students in the building.

""He was very, very good at getting people to trust him,"" Brophy said. ""Lauren was no different.""

The shooting left 49 people dead and another 53 wounded. The Republican governor named June 12 as ""Pulse Remembrance Day"" last year.

YOUNGKIN HOSTS VIRGINIA PRIDE EVENT ANGERING SOME LGBTQ GROUPS

DeSantis has faced staunch criticism from the LGBTQ community over his support for legislation branded by critics as the ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill.

The parental rights in education law bans classroom discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity for students in grade three and younger and enables parents to sue school districts over the issue.

In response to the legislation, Disney suspended the company’s political contributions in Florida, and in turn, DeSantis led the state legislature in dissolving Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District that allowed the theme park to govern itself.

903,"$2M tabernacle stolen, angel statues desecrated at Catholic church in Brooklyn",Timothy Nerozzi,"

A Roman Catholic church in Brooklyn, New York, was desecrated Friday, with its most valuable and sacred possession stolen.

St. Augustine Catholic Church in Park Slope, Brooklyn, is investigating the theft and vandalism of its tabernacle – an antique, 18-karat gold piece of artwork made in the 19th century used to house the Eucharist.

The tabernacle is kept inside a thick metal casing when not supervised, which the burglars cut through. The tabernacle itself is estimated to be worth approximately $2 million.

""The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn is announcing the New York City Police Department is investigating a brazen crime of disrespect and hate, which desecrated the most Holy Eucharist and the altar at St. Augustine Catholic Church, located at 116 6th Avenue in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn,"" the Diocese of Brooklyn said in a statement.

""The burglar cut through a metal protective casing and made off with the Tabernacle, which dates back to when the church was built in the late 1800s,"" the diocese explained. ""This holy sacramental receptacle is irreplaceable due to its historical and artistic value.""

The theft does not appear to be solely motivated by material gain, as the culprits also decapitated two statues of angels on either side of the altar, according to local outlet Fox 5.

The vandals seemingly did not steal the Eucharist, but appear to have removed it and strewn the sacrament haphazardly about the altar. Theft of the Eucharist is a serious concern for Catholic churches – the sacrament has historically been a target for theft and subsequent desecration by anti-Catholic or anti-Christian groups.

""This is devastating, as the Tabernacle is the central focus of our church outside of worship, holding the Body of Christ, the Eucharist, which is delivered to the sick and homebound,"" Father Frank Tumino, pastor of St. Augustine, said in a statement.

""To know that a burglar entered the most sacred space of our beautiful Church and took great pains to cut into a security system is a heinous act of disrespect,"" he added.

The sacristy – a room behind the altar where clergy prepare to perform mass – was also raided, with a safe cut open. Nothing was inside.

A judge convicted an Alabama man of littering Thursday after he placed a flower box at the foot of his fiancee's grave.

The man, Winston Hagans, had placed the flower boxes at one Hannah Ford's grave multiple times following her death in January 2021, one month after the two got engaged, according to WTVM. Judge Jim McLaughlin found Hagans guilty and ordered him to pay a $50 littering fine as well as a $250 court charge.

Winston was first brought up on charges thanks to Tom Ford, Hannah Ford's father, who removed Hagans' flower boxes on multiple occasions.

Ford owns his daughter's grave site at Memorial Park Cemetery in Auburn, Alabama and, according to Hagans, never approved of their relationship.

A knife-wielding Maryland woman who slashed a man’s throat at a Taco Bell in Oregon this past July -- after he told her to “zip it” for berating the staff -- was sentenced Thursday to 7 years in prison, according to a report.

Caley Mason, 22, pleaded guilty in Clackamas County in September to second-degree assault in the knife attack that gave 48-year-old Jason Luczkow an 8-inch gash across his face and throat and required 100 stitches.

On July 9, Luczkow said he walked into a Taco Bell in Sandy – about 30 miles east of Portland – and saw Mason, clad in a blonde wig, yelling at the employees for taking too long.

“Apparently the management had already told her to leave,” Luczkow said. “As she continued to rant and rave, I told her to be quiet. Told her to zip it.”

Mason left the restaurant but returned moments later with a knife and attacked Luczkow, Det. Sam Craven told The Oregonian/OregonLive.

Mason then sped off in a silver Kia Soul, nearly running over his wife in the process, Luczkow said. Police said they pulled her over with her boyfriend and two young children – ages 2 and 4 – in the car, according to Clackamas County prosecutor Matt Semritc.

She warned that parents should pull their children out of public schools, else their children become indoctrinated and owned by the government.

""Pull your children out of school, it will not change. Starting next year, it will get worse,"" she said. ""It's not worth handing your child over to the government to let them teach them sexually explicit content or to teach them the indoctrination… The next thing you know, you look at your child, and you no longer recognize them because they're not your child anymore.""

914,Biden says 'Trump did not leave a very good situation' internationally,Ronn Blitzer,"

President Biden accused former President Donald Trump of causing harm on the international stage, claiming that he has had to pick up the pieces of the previous administration.

The president was in Pennsylvania speaking to the AFL-CIO at the labor organization's Quadrennial Constitutional Convention on Tuesday when he included some pointed words directed at his predecessor.

""I travel the world trying to put things back together. You know, Trump did not leave a very good situation,"" Biden said. ""You think I'm kidding? No matter where I go in the world, whether it was the Inter-American Conference we just had for this hemisphere, or NATO, or dealing with the ASEAN countries, or the Far East, guess what? They look at me and I say, I say, ‘America is back.’ And they look at me, and they say, ‘For how long?’""

Biden delivered the remarks at a crucial time in his presidency when it comes to international politics. The President just returned from a trip to Asia that included meetings with leaders of Japan, South Korea, India, and Australia. A remark during that trip caused tension with China, when Biden said he would take military action to defend Taiwan if China invaded. The White House swiftly walked back the comment.

915,"Jeffrey Epstein feared cellmate, a muscle-bound ex-cop charged in murder who was moved before financier's death: report",Nicole Darrah,"

A hulking ex-cop facing the death penalty on federal murder and drug charges was reportedly Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center — and an official says Epstein might have feared the former police officer, who was questioned after the disgraced financier's apparent suicide attempt last month and who was transferred out of Epstein's cell shortly before the 66-year-old died early Saturday.

Nicholas Tartaglione, who'd been a Briarcliffe Manor cop in Westchester County, N.Y., was charged in 2016 with the deaths of four men stemming from an alleged cocaine drug conspiracy. Epstein was housed at the MCC federal lockup with the 51-year-old former cop after his July arrest for sex trafficking, Tartaglione's attorney told Fox News on Monday.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN REPORTEDLY WASN'T CHECKED ON FOR HOURS BEFORE HIS APPARENT SUICIDE

Tartaglione was transferred out of Epstein's cell in the facility's Special Housing Unit — a heavily secured part of the MCC that separates high-profile inmates from the general population — after Epstein was placed on suicide watch, Tartaglione's attorney, Bruce Barket, said. It was not clear why he was transferred.

The most recent inmate assigned to Epstein's cell was transferred on Friday, just hours before his death, a source said.

A little more than two weeks before his death, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and required to have daily psychiatric evaluations after being discovered in his cell semi-conscious with bruising on his neck. Epstein was recently taken off suicide watch but it was not clear when, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News.

THERE'S 'NO WAY' JEFFREY EPSTEIN KILLED HIMSELF, A FORMER MCC INMATE SAYS

Though a suicide attempt was suspected of causing the injuries, sources at the time told WNBC that authorities hadn't ruled out an assault on Epstein, and an inmate, identified as Tartaglione, was questioned about the incident.

Tartaglione reportedly told officials he didn't see anything related to the apparent suicide attempt and maintained he didn't touch Epstein. Barket said the two men were ""in the same unit and doing well,"" adding rumors Tartaglione may have attacked Epstein are ""absolutely not true.""

""Any suggestion that Mr. Tartaglione assaulted anyone is a complete fabrication,"" Barket said in a statement, according to the Journal News. ""This story is being leaked to retaliate against Mr. Tartaglione for complaining to the court about the deplorable conditions at the MCC.""

Barket suggested the allegations about his client may have been leaked by someone “trying to embarrass Epstein and cast some shade on Nick.”

In fact, a law enforcement source told the New York Daily News last month that Tartaglione claimed he helped Epstein after he found him unconscious in his cell during his reported suicide attempt.

The source seemingly confirmed Barket's assertions about the ""deplorable conditions"" at the facility, which ""border on inhumane,"" the attorney described to Fox News on Monday.

“At the end of the day, the facility is run with a bad combination of laziness and cruelty and this is one of the results,” Barket said, noting he hopes the investigation into Epstein's apparent suicide includes “the manner in which the facility is run and the conditions under which inmates are forced to live.”

JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S PRISON GUARDS: 1 NOT A REGULAR OFFICER AND BOTH WERE WORKING OVERTIME, REPORT SAYS

“You’ve got a guy who is a millionaire who is now living among rats and mold and wants to go home,” the source said. “This is a disgusting place and the people there, they treat you disgusting. Who wouldn’t be suicidal in that kind of place? You have a silver spoon in your mouth and then you’re put in a cesspool.”

Barket didn't dispute what Tartaglione allegedly claimed. He did tell the Daily News his client and Epstein ""became more than cordial,"" and even went so far as to say the two ""became friends.""

The attorney told Fox News on Monday there was no reason for Epstein to fear Tartaglione, and his ""sense is he did not fear Nick.""

But regardless, Epstein indeed might have been trying to get away from Tartaglione, E.O. Young, the national president of the Council of Prison Locals C-33, told The Washington Post.

Tartaglione is awaiting trial after investigators said he was involved in the kidnapping and killing of four men in 2016. In February 2018, while being held at MCC, Tartaglione himself was assaulted, the Journal News reported.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S APPARENT SUICIDE IN FEDERAL LOCKUP RAISES QUESTIONS

In the 2018 attack, Barket said Tartaglione required reconstructive surgery after an eye socket bone was fractured. The attorney said at the time that, in the Special Housing Unit at MCC, where Epstein later was also housed, Tartaglione was ""quite literally in a box staring at walls...Not surprisingly his mental health has declined.""

Federal prosecutors reportedly plan to seek the death penalty against Tartaglione.

Epstein was being held on child sex trafficking and conspiracy charges after his July arrest. Prosecutors said he sexually abused dozens of young girls in his New York and Florida residences between 2002 and 2005. Epstein pleaded not guilty and faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted.

Famous, high-profile and notorious prisoners — as well as those accused of sex crimes against children — are often given extra protection against attacks from other prisoners. But it was not immediately clear what specific precautions, if any, were taken in Epstein’s case.

918,Lauren Boebert taking legal action over Dem PAC's 'false and disgusting claims' that she was 'paid escort',Houston Keene,"

FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., will take legal action against the Democrat political action committee (PAC) that claimed, without evidence, that she was an ""unlicensed paid escort,"" Fox News Digital has learned.

Boebert's attorney sent a letter to the American Muckrakers PAC regarding the claims that she was an ""unlicensed paid escort"" who had ""two abortions,"" pledging to bring ""civil defamation"" lawsuits against the PAC.

""Partisan organizations putting out blatantly false and disgusting accusations won’t stop me from advancing freedom and conservative values,"" Boebert told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday statement. ""This group's vile conduct demonstrates why people are fed up with politics. I am not going to stand by and pretend this is normal behavior.""

ANTI-MADISON CAWTHORN PAC THAT LEAKED EXPLICIT VIDEOS WILL TARGET REP. LAUREN BOEBERT NEXT: REPORT

""This political committee, funded by far-left Democrat donors and run by two left-wing political operatives, published pages of false statements knowing they were completely fabricated,"" she continued. ""The law on this type of defamation is clear and this conduct will be subject to civil and criminal penalties. Attached is a letter from my attorney introducing our response to these lies.""

In the letter, which was exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, Boebert's attorney Jonathan Anderson wrote that the PAC published ""a series of false and defamatory statements"" about the congresswoman through the Tuesday release and pointed out that while ""Muckrakers has marketed itself as a ‘watchdog group,’ the truth is that Muckrakers is a political committee that exclusively opposes conservative candidates, is funded by established Democrat donor sources, and is managed by Democrat political operatives.""

""We have irrefutable evidence that each one of these statements is patently false. You knew this though,"" Anderson wrote. ""Muckrakers published these outlandish statements knowing they were fabricated but you likely operated under the inaccurate assumption that publishing false statements against a public figure would not create legal liability.""

""This will be a costly miscalculation for Muckrakers, Wheeler and Muckrakers’ donors,"" the attorney added.

Anderson noted that proving a defamation case against a public figure has a ""heightened standard of proof"" and said that what ""is legally, and financially, disastrous for Muckrakers is the fact that we also have evidence, including internal Muckrakers’ text and email communications, that demonstrates Muckrakers did in fact publish statements knowing those statements to be false.""

""In addition to the civil defamation claims that will be filed, Muckrakers’ actions are criminally liable. Colorado statute expressly prohibits the circulation of ‘knowingly or recklessly’ false information meant to influence an election,"" Anderson wrote. ""In addition, Wheeler also sent letters to the State of Utah and State of Colorado requesting an investigation. Wheeler’s letters contain multiple knowingly false statements.""

The press release accuses Boebert of working as an ""unlicensed escort"" for the sugar daddy website and that she met Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, when hired by a ""Koch family member"" in Aspen, Colorado. The release also claimed the congresswoman had a pair of abortions and said that the allegations came from an anonymous source.

Additionally, the release included heavily redacted text messages where the PAC staffer appeared to lead the unknown person on the other end to suggest Boebert was blackmailing Cruz for political backing as well as photos of a woman the PAC claimed to be Boebert from her sugar daddy website page.

The text messages also claimed Boebert and her husband had a ""Meth drug problem"" and that the congresswoman was ""stripping at the time,"" as well.

LAUREN BOEBERT PUSHES TO CLASSIFY FENTANYL AS A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION

None of these claims were backed up with hard evidence.

In fact, the woman in the photos cited by the PAC was identified last year as Melissa Carone, a woman who made unsupported voter fraud claims during the 2020 election that were cited by former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.

Additionally, it appears as though the PAC removed one of the photos they were trying to say was Boebert from their copy-pasted press release on their website — but the currently active link on the website to the release as well as its archived version still have the photo.

Liberals have been quick to jump on the seedy allegations, which spread like wildfire across social media.

919,WHO renaming monkeypox virus after scientists voice concern that it is 'discriminatory and stigmatizing',Paul Best,"

The World Health Organization announced Tuesday that it will rename the monkeypox virus, which has infected more than 1,600 people in 39 countries this year, after a group of scientists voiced concerns that the name could be stigmatizing.

""WHO is also working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades and the disease it causes,"" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing on Tuesday. ""We will make an announcement about the new names as soon as possible.""

The announcement comes after a group of more than 30 international scientists urged the health community to change the name of the virus last week.

""The prevailing perception in the international media and scientific literature is that MPXV is endemic in people in some African countries. However, it is well established that nearly all MPXV outbreaks in Africa prior to the 2022 outbreak, have been the result of spillover from animals to humans and only rarely have there been reports of sustained human-to-human transmissions,"" the scientists wrote on June 10.

""In the context of the current global outbreak, continued reference to, and nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing.""

The WHO lists two known clades of monkeypox on its website, ""one identified in West Africa (WA) and one in the Congo Basin (CB) region.""

The group of scientists wrote that using this nomenclature is ""counter to the best practice of avoiding geographic locations in the nomenclature of diseases and disease groups.""

WHO: MONKEYPOX BECOMING 'ESTABLISHED' IN NON-ENDEMIC COUNTRIES IS 'REAL' RISK

According to the CDC, scientists first found monkeypox during two outbreaks of a pox-like disease in monkeys at a research facility in Denmark in 1958. The first human case was found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970.

The biggest current outbreak is in the United Kingdom, where health officials have detected 470 cases.

Human-to-human transmission of the virus occurs primarily through direct contact with infected people or surfaces that are contaminated.

HAWAII REPORTS THIRD CASE OF PROBABLE MONKEYPOX

Ghebreyesus also said that the WHO will convene an emergency meeting next week to determine whether the spread of monkeypox should be considered a public health emergency worldwide.

""The outbreak of monkeypox is unusual and concerning,"" Ghebreyesus said Tuesday. ""For that reason, I have decided to convene the emergency committee under the international health regulations next week to assess whether this outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.""

The CDC has reported 65 monkeypox cases in the U.S., including 15 in California and 11 in New York.

Monkeypox has similar symptoms to smallpox, but is milder. Infected individuals typically develop flu-like symptoms followed by a rash that turns into lesions.

The WHO has had a troubled run in recent years, facing accusations that it failed to keep China transparent as the COVID pandemic swept from Wuhan to the world, and then accusations that it skipped over the Greek letter Xi when naming variants of the virus to avoid offending China's communist leader, President Xi Jinping.",https://www.foxnews.com

921,No more 'Pariah' state as Biden seeks help from the Saudis as gas prices skyrocket,Benjamin Weinthal,"

President Biden is slated to make his first trip since taking office to the oil-rich nation of Saudi Arabia in July, with what some observers say is the goal of reducing gasoline prices for consumers and confronting Iran’s nuclear weapons program.

U.S.-Saudi relations have hit a historic nadir. Earlier this year Saudi Arabia reportedly refused a request from Biden to speak amid rising oil prices due to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Mohammed Khalid Alyahya, a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington D.C., noted that the first thing to be done was ""Fixing a relationship that has been beneficial for eighty-years to the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. It has not reached a low worse than recently.""

To broker a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia, Biden will have to abandon his campaign pledge to treat the kingdom as a ""pariah"" state after it, according to the CIA, carried out the assassination of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi in its consulate in Istanbul.

""There’s no way around the fact that the Saudi trip marks a reversal of President Biden’s original effort to downgrade the bilateral relationship while humiliating and ostracizing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,"" John Hannah, a former national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital.

WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL PRESSED ON BIDEN'S SAUDI TRIP IN LIGHT OF ‘PARIAH’ COMMENT

Hannah, a senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) stated the visit was ""a major climb down for the administration that’s been forced on them by $5 per gallon gasoline prices, raging inflation, and an accommodationist policy toward Iran that has reached a dead end.""

Hannah continued, ""All of the virtue signaling of the administration’s first few months in office, aimed at making good on the president’s campaign promise to turn the Saudis into pariahs, might have made the Democratic Party’s progressive left feel good,"" but he said Biden’s playing to the progressive constituency ""backfired miserably when it came to serving U.S. national interests.""

GAS PRICES HIT $5 NATIONWIDE

He added that ""it poisoned relations with the Arab and Muslim world’s most influential country to a point where it wouldn’t even take a call from the President of the United States in the middle of a European crisis (the Ukraine war) that posed the greatest challenge to the American-led international order in the past 30 years.""

WHITE HOUSE DECLASSIFIES KHASHOGGI REPORT BLAMING SAUDI CROWN PRINCE

According to a White House statement on Tuesday, Biden will travel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to discuss ""the UN-mediated truce in Yemen, which has led to the most peaceful period there since war began seven years ago….expanding regional economic and security cooperation, including new and promising infrastructure and climate initiatives, as well as deterring threats from Iran, advancing human rights, and ensuring global energy and food security.""

Critics of the kingdom have urged Biden to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for alleged involvement in terrorism and human rights abuses, other critics have shown shock over his policy U-turn.

Ali Al-Ahmed, the director of the Washington D.C. based Gulf Institute said Biden's decision to visit the Kingdom will be seen as, ""one of the biggest mistakes,"" made by a U.S. president. Noting that Biden, who had called the Saudis a ""pariah,"" is showing weakness to friend and foe alike.

""Now American allies in the region are going to say maybe we will copy what MBS is doing. If he can bring the American president to his knees we can do that too.""

Al-Ahmed stated that, ""the impact of this capitulation is strategic as it will encourage Putin in Russia and Xi Jinping in China to become more aggressive with a president who was outwitted by (the) young MBS.""

9/11 FAMILIES DEMAND RELEASE OF FBI DOCUMENTS DETAILING SAUDI ROLE IN TERRORIST ATTACK

Also, critical of Biden's visit are the families who lost relatives in the 9/11 terror attacks.

""We appreciate the President’s commitment to do everything he can to support the 9/11 family community, but empathy is not enough. President Biden must do what past Presidents have not, which is to demand transparency from Saudi Arabia and accountability for those who supported al-Qaeda and the hijackers who murdered our loved ones,"" said Terry Strada, National Chair of 9/11 Families United.

The 9/11 Families United organization is a coalition of family members of victims and survivors of the terrorist attacks.According to 9/11 Families United, declassified U.S. intelligence showed ""a document seized in the days after the 9/11 Attacks from a Saudi agent who is known to have provided substantial assistance to the hijackers, showing a drawing of a plane and formula used to calculate the rate of descent required of an aircraft to reach a target on the horizon at a given speed.""

Brian Katulis, a senior fellow and vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute in Washington told Fox News Digital ""It seems that the Biden administration’s Middle East policy approach is growing up, moving from adolescence toward a more mature phase of a balanced engagement with close partners in the region.""

SAUDI ARABIA'S BIDEN-HARRIS SKIT HIGHLIGHTS RIYADH'S FRUSTRATION WITH D.C

""The hyper-partisan noise and cheap politics in America aimed at trying to make the bilateral relationship a partisan wedge issue in America’s internal politics has actually damaged America’s ability to get things done in the Middle East and achieve its stated goals. This has been a problem in U.S.-Saudi relations as well as U.S.-Israel relations, and hopefully this visit will help set a new, steadier tone,"" he continued.

On human rights and the Khashoggi murder, Katulis advised: ""The Biden administration should instead use this opportunity for re-engaging Saudi Arabia more deeply to have candid conversations about how the kingdom’s practices on human rights create distance between itself and key parts of the rest of the world, and also aren’t compatible with its own efforts to social reform agendas at home.""

Appearing in a MSNBC panel Monday, Alcindor told host Andrea Mitchell that the ""biggest challenge"" the January 6 House Select Committee faced was getting Americans to have the same level of concern for their investigation.

Still, she urged Democrats to convince Americans these hearings were foundational to protecting the country.

""These lawmakers are going to try now have a narrative to focus the country’s attention to say, Look at this thing. Do not turn away.

923,Biden announces $1.2B in additional Ukraine aid,Caitlin Mcfall,"

President Biden on Wednesday announced that another $1.2 billion in security and humanitarian assistance will be granted to Ukraine as the deadly war with Russia continues.

Biden said he informed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that $1 billion in defensive aid will be sent in the form of artillery, coastal defense weapons, ammunition and advanced rocket systems.

An additional $225 million of the funds will be sent for humanitarian assistance to supply ""safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items,"" the White House said in a statement.

The decision to send additional aid comes as Zelenskyy repeatedly urged Western nations to send additional and timely assistance as Russian forces advance across eastern Ukraine.

Though Moscow has made gains in the Donbas, it has also been unable to adequately replenish its troops' offensive needs and Russia's soldiers have begun to rely on dated munitions and artillery.

Over 50 countries plus NATO and European Union officials met at NATO headquarters in Brussels Wednesday for the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting.

Collectively they discussed what Ukraine needs to counter Russia’s continued offenses.

""We can't afford to let up and we can't lose steam. The stakes are too high,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during the group’s third meeting since its establishment in April. ""Ukraine is facing a pivotal moment on the battlefield.""

Austin pointed to Zelenskyy’s previous warnings that after Russia failed to take the capital city of Kyiv earlier this year Moscow would set its sights on the Donbas.



UN WARNS UKRAINE INVASION COULD CAUSE WORLDWIDE FOOD SHORTAGES

Kremlin officials have since confirmed their military ambitions in Ukraine are to take control over the eastern and southern regions.

But Ukrainian officials have also warned they believe Russia will take another stab at Kyiv and potentially move beyond Ukrainian borders.

""We must intensify our shared commitment to Ukraine's self-defense, and we must push ourselves even harder to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself, its citizens and its territory,"" Austin told world leaders. ""But make no mistake, Russia's unprovoked and indefensible invasion isn't just a danger to Ukraine. It's a menace to European security, and it's an affront to the rules-based international order that protects us all.""

Austin said the U.S. had already provided Howitzers, Javelins, ammunition, helicopters, counter artillery radars, tactical vehicles and electronic jamming equipment.

""Along with our partners, we're also training Ukrainian forces on new capabilities, and we're committed to doing even more,"" he added.

924,Planning a 2-week vacation getaway? Experts say workers should think again,Erica Lamberg,"

On the surface, the thought of taking two weeks off from work for an extended vacation may seem like a dreamy break from all the pressures of work.

But before you book that two-week trip, there’s more to consider than merely being off the clock for 10 work days at once.

The truth is that a two-week vacation can be a direct trip to hassles and work headaches that will await you when you return from all that extended fun and sun.

Consider the advice of some experts before locking in a two-week getaway (unless it's for something very, very special — read on!).

NY TEENS ARE MAKING $70 AN HOUR BY BABYSITTING, SPORTS INSTRUCTING

Essentially, these experts recommend that any notions of being away from a professional job for two full work weeks in a row should remain just that: a notion.

While that doesn't mean workers aren't entitled to an appropriate amount of time off, consider these insights when thinking about or planning an extended period of vacation time away from the job.

Realize you’re using most of your time off all at once

If you allocate most of your vacation days to one long trip, you’re left with little or no extra vacation days the rest of the year.

""Using a big chunk of vacation time all at once may mean you have fewer days off to use throughout the year,"" said Amy Morin, psychotherapist, licensed clinical social worker and author of ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do.""

COLLEGE GRADUATES NEED THESE 10 ‘INFLATION-PROOF’ CAREER AND MONEY TIPS NOW

""If you've saved up for one big vacation, you might be disappointed when you have to return to work and have few vacation days left,"" she added.

A long work break may cause anxiety and other stresses

We’re glued to our devices and few of us truly unplug when we are on vacation.

""A longer vacation may not necessarily mean deeper relaxation,"" Morin noted. ""You might find you start worrying about work the longer you're away — and you might be more tempted to start checking messages while you're supposed to be away from the office.""

Also, while taking an extended vacation, you might grow increasingly anxious about what you're missing at work.

""You might feel stressed when you begin thinking of the workload you're going to return to,"" Morin said. ""Responding to emails, addressing issues that went unresolved in your absence and learning what you missed may be quite stressful.""

THINKING OF QUITTING YOUR JOB? MAYBE TRY REINVENTING YOURSELF AT WORK FIRST

Morin also pointed out that, in some situations and workplaces, ""vacation shaming"" is a real thing.

""Learning what you missed may be quite stressful.""

Though this goes against the best practices in human resources and general management, she said the reality is that ""some managers may try to embarrass an employee for taking time off. They may even become passive-aggressive and schedule important things during an employee's vacation.""

Know there are times you'll get a pass

Two-week vacations are common for weddings and honeymoons, but you may also take one if you're going on a special trip.

""A trip to Europe or even Hawaii might warrant an extended stay,"" said Morin.

""You should just consider whether the joy of an extended vacation is going to outweigh the risks you face by being away from the office for an extended period,"" she added.

""If you're going to take an extended vacation, make sure it's for something special.""

Understand how a two-week vacation impacts your company

Wendy L. Patrick, JD, PhD, a lecturer in business law at San Diego State University, said that in the corporate world, taking a long vacation can be disruptive for some workplaces and cultures.

She said this is especially true now that offices and other workplaces have lost a number of valuable ""go-to"" employees during the last two years of the ""Great Resignation.""

""A two-week vacation can also be disruptive because it might generate resentment among younger or newer employees who are struggling to afford gas to get to and from work, much less able to plan a two-week vacation,"" she said.

What if the boss does it?

What if a manager or supervisor takes that two-week vacation — and leaves employees more or less on their own for that time period?

Patrick said such a scenario doesn't always set the right tone for others, especially for younger or newer employees with a stricter work ethic.

This is true even for those who can afford such a vacation, she said.

""Supervisors also might be seen as irresponsible when they decide to take a long vacation during a tenuous transition time of establishing new work schedules — which usually means lots of questions by younger employees,"" she added.

Consider these additional insights

Employee productivity can also be affected during a long vacation from work.

""Many employees are good at what they do because they do it every day,"" said Patrick, addressing productivity.

Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., issued a statement about the death of his daughter Gwen, including some words about how she lived her life and some details about the evening before she died.

Gwen Casten, 17, died Monday morning, according to the congressman's office, and so far no cause of death has been revealed. Casten's statement, posted to Twitter Wednesday, did not seem to indicate that anything unusual happened beforehand.

""On Sunday night, we had dinner as a family and then she went out with some friends for a few hours. When she got home, she said goodnight to Kara and I, texted a friend to make sure she got home OK, and didn’t wake up on Monday morning,"" Casten said. ""The only thing we know about her death is that it was peaceful. And the only lesson we can take from that is to savor the moments you have with your loved ones. We want purpose. We want to believe in a brighter tomorrow. But the only thing we can control is our present.""

Police in Downers Grove, Illinois, said they were called to the Casten home around 6:48 a.m. for an unresponsive 17-year-old female and determined that she was deceased.

Gwen's death comes as Casten is in the middle of seeking a third term in Congress in Illinois' newly redrawn 6th district.

""There are no words to describe the hole in your heart when a child dies,"" Casten’s statement said. He described Gwen as ""a happy, healthy, well adjusted young woman"" who was preparing to start college at the University of Vermont in the fall.

He recalled her love of music and activism, specifically her performances with her school’s jazz band, wind ensemble, and pit orchestra, as well as her creation of a school Empowerment Club where she and fellow students dedicated their time to issues including gun violence, the environment, LGBTQ rights, Black Lives Matter rallies, and voter registration.

926,Ron DeSantis’ joke about ‘African-American support’ from Elon Musk slammed by liberal media: ‘This is sick’,Lindsay Kornick,"

Members of the liberal mainstream media didn’t appreciate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ joke about having Elon Musk’s support on Wednesday.

After the Tesla CEO announced that he voted for a Republican for the first time ever on Twitter, Musk also mentioned that he was leaning towards supporting DeSantis as a presidential candidate in 2024.

When DeSantis was informed of Musk's support, he told the press that while he’s primarily focused on the 2022 gubernatorial election, he welcomes ""support from African-Americans,"" referencing Musk, who is White and was born in South Africa.

Many mainstream media pundits attacked this quip by interpreting it in the most uncharitable light possible, suggesting that the joke reveals DeSantis’ racism.

ELON MUSK’S FIRST-EVER GOP VOTE TRIGGERS DEM CONGRESSMAN: MUSK ‘SUPPORTS WHITE SUPREMACY’

""If [sic] said before that @GovRonDeSantis is a humorless, more openly fascist version of Trump. Here he is displaying the former quality in that for him, ‘humor’ means mocking Black Americans with his own, idiotic and offensive version of replacement theory. Black Floridians take note,"" MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted.

""Is there a joke somewhere in here? I don’t get it,"" CNN commentator and ""The View"" co-host Ana Navarro wrote.

CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen tweeted, ""I understand the ugliness of what he‘s doing here because I am a member of a minority too. We are not a punch line & neither are Black Americans. Jokes about skin color & physical features have no place. This is sick.""

""F*ck all these people,"" The Nation correspondent Elie Mystal wrote.

927,Former FBI special agent rips Democrats amid crime surge: 'Politicization of law enforcement',Bailee Hill,"

A former FBI special agent slammed Democrats Thursday for the ""politicization of law enforcement"" as cities nationwide fail to report crucial crime data for last year.

Former FBI special agent and former Navy SEAL Jonathan T. Gilliam joined ""Fox & Friends First"" to discuss the impact the lack of reporting has on tracking violence in city streets.

""I try to stay neutral when I look at these things and say that this is a reason or that's a reason without the politics, but the reality is, and law enforcement is becoming more and more beholden to leftist mayors and governors and even the president,"" Gilliam told co-host Carley Shimkus.

""So when we look at the cities where these reportings are lagging behind, we're looking at predominantly liberal cities where the majority of crime is taking place,"" he continued. ""And they have a myriad of excuses, but the reality is the politicization of law enforcement is so out of control that we can't even get real statistics.""

According to an Axios report, the FBI is missing 40% of crime data for 2021 since law enforcement agencies have failed to send voluntary statistics. This number has spiked 15% since 2020.

""The problem is, if somebody is subscribed to the Democrat or liberal way, they are 100% across the board, local, state and federal, the exact same way in that they handle law enforcement and crime,"" Gilliam said. ""And as we've seen, they do nothing effectively even after this last shooting in Texas.

928,Philadelphia police underreported crime data to FBI for city's bloodiest year on record,Emma Colton,"

The Philadelphia Police Department underreported crime statistics to the FBI for 2021, a historically bloody year for the city, new data show.

Roughly 2.1 million crimes across the country will go unreported to the FBI, according to data examined by The Marshall Project and Axios. Philadelphia is among the roughly 60% of U.S. law enforcement agencies that failed to report a full year of data or no data at all to the federal agency.

All in, Philadelphia reported only nine months worth of data to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System. Local police officials cite the city implementing a new crime reporting system for the gap in data.

The Philadelphia Police Department received nearly $4 million in 2016 to upgrade its reporting system, which was officially launched on April 1, 2021, Axios reported. The FBI also switched to a new recording method last year, the National Incident-Based Reporting System, amid a push to better record crime figures and individual incidents.

PHILADELPHIA’S RECORD VIOLENCE SPILLS INTO NEW YEAR AFTER AT LEAST 3 KILLED, 7 WOUNDED IN SHOOTINGS

Philadelphia Police Sgt. Eric Gripp told the outlet that there was a ""significant project delay"" to upgrade the city’s previous system, which was compounded by the pandemic.

""The Philadelphia Police Department began NIBRS reporting on April 1, 2021. The delay was caused by issues in updating our system to take on the additional data requirements necessary for NIBRS reporting,"" a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Police Department told Fox News Digital of the matter.

Mayor Jim Kenney’s office directed Fox News Digital to the police department’s statement when approached for comment.

Gripp told Axios that the lack of data to the FBI ""will have no impact on the Police Department's relationship with the community,"" and added that the city’s crime data for that year is available on its OpenDataPhilly site.

VIOLENT CRIMES ON THE RISE IN 2022, FOLLOWING PREVIOUS UNPRECEDENTED SPIKE IN MURDERS

About 40% of law enforcement agencies across the country submitted no voluntary data to the FBI for 2021, which is up from 15% in 2020, according to Axios. In Pennsylvania specifically, 31 of about 1,500 agencies reported any data to the FBI last year, which is actually higher than 2020’s figures, when 22 agencies in the state reported crime figures.

Philadelphia set an all-time record for homicides in 2021, recording 562 deaths. The crime has spilled into this year, with the city hitting 200 homicides just after Memorial Day weekend.

The skyrocketing crime in the city sparked an impeachment effort of the city's progressive district attorney, Larry Krasner, which was launched this week by three Republican state representatives.

930,House GOP bill would reimburse Texas for operation to crack down on illegal immigration,Adam Shaw,"

FIRST ON FOX: A bill introduced by House Republicans on Friday would reimburse the state of Texas for the costs of its Operation Lone Star -- the state’s effort to crack down on illegal immigration amid a historic border crisis.

The Lone Star Reimbursement Act, introduced by Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, would reimburse the state for the operation announced by Gov. Greg Abbott last year and which has surged law enforcement to the Texas-Mexico border to stop the flood of illegal immigration coming across.

TEXAS' OPERATION LONE STAR TO GET ANOTHER $500 MILLION TO SECURE BORDER, ABBOTT SAYS

The bill cites estimates that the Texas Military has so far apprehended and referred over 134,000 illegal immigrants to law enforcement, and has turned back or denied crossing to over 16,000 migrants.

""It is the sense of Congress that Operation Lone Star has been a tremendous help to stem the tide of illegal immigration and its members should be recognized for their efforts,"" the bill says.

The bill would make $1.4 billion available to Texas for its FY 2021 and FY 2022 costs. The lawmakers supporting the bill say that because the job of securing the border is that of the federal government, states that take that responsibility should be reimbursed by the federal government.

""To put it simply, border security is national security,"" Fallon said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""As a border state, Texas is disproportionally impacted by illegal immigration, but we shouldn’t be forced to bear the entire financial burden when it comes to securing the entire country. Gov. Abbott launched Operation Lone Star because of a lack of action from this administration. Texas shouldn’t be punished for Biden’s mistake and my Lone Star Reimbursement Act recognizes this.""

MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER HIT NEW RECORD IN MAY, AS NUMBERS KEEP RISING

Co-sponsors on the bill are Texas Reps. Kay Granger, Roger Williams, Jake Ellzey, Ronny Jackson, Randy Weber, Michael Cloud, Brian Babin, Michael Burgess, Troy Nehls, and Louie Gohmert.

""Our southern border is no longer just about families coming to find a better life. The Biden administration has intentionally failed in its responsibility to protect the American people, and Texans have paid the price, both figuratively and literally."" Ellzey said in a statement. ""Over the two years, Texans have spent over $3 billion dollars to secure our border. Per the Constitution, that is a federal function, and we owe Texans every penny they have paid. I am proud to stand with my fellow colleagues in filling the Lone Star Reimbursement Act. If the President won't do his job, Congress will.""

It is the latest move by Republicans in the delegation to reimburse the state for the operation. Burgess has previously offered amendments to various appropriations bills in the House to fund the program -- arguing that ""Texas should not be bearing the sole cost to secure our southern border.""

Although Harris mentioned concern about white supremacy online and privacy protection for abortions in her remarks, neither she nor the memo mentioned far-left Antifa groups doxxing politicians or other dangerous leftist activity online.

Flores, who won a contest Tuesday for an open seat House seat along the nation’s southern border in the Rio Grande Valley, made history as the first Mexican-born congresswoman. And she's the first Republican to win in the heavily Hispanic district since it was created a decade ago.

""The Democrat Party has been in control here in South Texas for over 100 years and feel entitled to our vote. They feel they don’t have to do anything to earn our vote.

Asked why the district’s two counties that border Mexico — Cameron and Hidalgo counties — swung heavily towards her, Flores answered ""because I’m one of them and I’m also standing up for our values. God, family, our community. That’s who we are in South Texas. We’re all about hard work.""

Flores topped 50% — avoiding a runoff — in a four-candidate race, edging Democrat Dan Sanchez by nearly eight points, to fill out the final six moths of the term of former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who resigned in March to take a job as with a lobbying firm.

Not only does Flores’ victory narrow by one seat the House Democrats’ already razor-thin majority in the chamber, but it also gives Republicans more momentum heading into November’s midterm elections, when they aim to flip other Democratic controlled Hispanic majority districts.

""This is just the beginning and I believe that Hispanics throughout the country are going to see that more Hispanics are joining the Republican Party and they will do the research of why and when they do, they’ll realize that their values align with the Republican Party,"" Flores predicted.

And Flores, a respiratory therapist who spotlighted her story as the wife of a U.S. Border Patrol agent and as a Mexican immigrant whose parents brought her to the U.S. as a child, said ""there’s a saying that Hispanics are Republican, they just don’t know it. Well, we know it now.""

A memo released Wednesday by the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is the re-election arm of the House GOP, noted that ""Democrats have dominated elections in the heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley for over 100 years,"" and argued that ""Flores’ victory in the TX-34 Special Election is proof that Republicans have a winning message with Hispanic voters and that no Democrat is safe in the current political environment.""

The seat was one of three border districts in Texas the NRCC was aiming to flip from blue to red this year. They’ve also got their eyes on turning majority Hispanic districts in Arizona and California in November.

""Mayra’s victory proved we have the blueprint for success in South Texas, and it sets Republicans up for even greater success in November,"" the NRCC touted. ""This is the first of many Democrat-held seats that will flip Republican in 2022.""

SPLIT DECISION FOR TRUMP IN TWO HIGH-PROFILE PRIMARIES

Flores and her Republican allies shelled out over $1 million to run TV ads in the special election, vastly outspending Sanchez. National Democratic groups did spend some money at the last minute to help out Sanchez with ads taking aim at Flores. But mostly, they stayed on the sidelines, arguing that it wasn’t worth spending money to protect a seat that would be up again in November.

That’s when Democratic Rep. Vincente Gonzalez, who represents a neighboring district, will run in a newly drawn 34th District, which Democrats say is more favorable to their party.

""MAGA Republican Mayra Flores shouldn’t get too comfortable — she’ll barely have enough time to set up her desk before South Texans send her packing again. It’s all eyes on November now as we gear up to send Vicente Gonzalez back to Congress this fall,"" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney argued.

And DCCC spokesperson Monica Robinson said that ""the only thing the NRCC proved last night is that they can barely get their MAGA Republican candidates across the finish line when they outspend the Democrat 20 to 1 and if only 7% of the electorate turns out to vote. This seat is a rental for Republicans and we look forward to welcoming Vicente Gonzalez back to Congress this fall.""

But Flores disagrees.

""We won because of Cameron County, and we came really close in Hidalgo County. And these counties remain in my district. So, this idea that it’s going to be easier for the Democrats in November, it’s completely wrong,"" she emphasized.

And looking ahead to her November matchup with Gonzalez, she warned ""this is going to be the toughest race he’s ever run in his life.""

938,Baby formula shortage bills pass House amid GOP claims Dems are 'covering up' the real problem,Tyler O'Neil,"

The U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills to address the baby formula shortage Wednesday, with one vote far more partisan than the other and after a Republican leader condemned one measure as ""covering up"" the real problem.

The House voted 414-9 to pass H.R. 7791, a measure that would allow low-income women to purchase more baby formula through the federal Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program.

In a more partisan vote, 231-192, the House passed H.R. 7790, the Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022. The bill provides $28 million in emergency appropriations for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the shortage of FDA-regulated infant formula and prevent further shortages, including efforts to ""prevent fraudulent products from entering the United States market.""

Only 12 Republicans voted for H.R. 7790.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., heralded the legislation as an effort ""to secure important flexibility for the WIC program to help vulnerable families buy infant formula in times of emergency."" She said H.R. 7791 would empower WIC to respond to supply chain disruptions by relaxing ""certain non-safety-related regulations – and in doing so, make sure America's babies get the nutrition they need right now and for the future.""

She also praised the appropriations bill for delivering ""urgently needed resources"" to the FDA.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., sent out a memo Wednesday urging Republicans to vote ""no"" on the appropriations bill, The Hill reported.

He claimed Pelosi proposed the legislation ""in hopes of covering up the administration’s ineptitude by throwing additional money at the FDA with no plan to actually fix the problem, all while failing to hold the FDA accountable.""

SWITCHING BABY FORMULAS? HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., proposed Wednesday a GOP bill to address the shortage, the Babies Need More Formula Now Act. That bill would increase the supply of baby formula by lifting restrictions on the importation of infant formula and reducing barriers to innovation by new brands.

The GOP bill would also establish oversight and accountability at the FDA to ensure that the agency can act quickly to maintain a healthy supply of baby formula in the future.

In comments to Fox Business, Turnaround CEO Harry Wilson, who led the turnaround of General Motors after it filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and who is running for governor of New York, blamed the Biden administration's ""bureaucratic bungling"" for the crisis.

""Because of bureaucratic bungling, slowness and not dealing with the implications of an oversupply economy, we now have this tragic shortage that's really hurting families across the country,"" Harry Wilson said.

Wilson said the recession the U.S. is potentially facing under Biden may be ""more complicated, harder to solve and just as dire"" as the 2008 economic crisis and is partly to blame for the fear and uncertainty many parents are facing following the Abbott plant shutdown.

Wilson claims Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is responsible for sky-high prices affecting consumer across the country and said the negative impact of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package doesn’t end with inflation .

""There are other effects driven by excess demand, driven by federal government spending. So, for example, because there's excess demand, that's putting strain on both freight and labor and well, that's true for the whole economy,"" Wilson said.

President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday and directed the Department of Defense to pick up formula from overseas that meets U.S. health standards.

About 43% of the baby formula supply nationwide was out-of-stock at the beginning of this month, according to Datasembly, which tracks retail stores across the United States.

AMID THE BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE, SC MOM GOES VIRAL FOR POST

The out-of-stock rate increased from between 2% and 8% in the first half of 2021, to 23% in January, then 33% in April.

Abbott, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the U.S., temporarily shut down its Michigan plant and recalled several of its brands, compounding an already-squeezed baby formula supply that had faced supply chain issues.

Four infants who had consumed Abbott's products were hospitalized with bacterial infections, though the company has denied that its formula caused the illnesses.

The FDA reached a deal with Abbott to temporarily reopen that Michigan plant on Monday, but it could be two weeks before production begins and six to eight weeks before formula hits shelves.

939,CNN frets Democrats losing Hispanic voters: Texas election 'big warning sign',Kristine Parks,"

CNN journalists alerted Democrats that the Republican-won Texas special election in a historically Democratic district was a ""big warning sign"" to their party to stop taking Hispanic voters for granted.

Political analyst John Avlon worried that Republicans were appealing to Latinos on the economy and cultural issues, citing Donald Trump winning more Latinos in the 2020 election than he did in 2016.

Avlon warned the Democratic Party was missing the mark by using ""identity politics"" with the ""diverse"" community of Hispanic voters, of whom 52% identified as independent in 2021.

""[T]hat’s ten points higher than the population overall. So you can see why Democrats default to identity politics doesn’t really work. Here is more evidence, polling shows that one in four Hispanic voters have even heard of the politically correct term ‘Latinx’ and only 3% use it to describe themselves,"" he said.

MSNBC ANALYST: DEMS NEED TO ‘SCARE THE HELL OUT’ OF MINORITY VOTERS THAT ‘WE’RE GOING TO LOSE OUR DEMOCRACY’

""This massive American community cannot be taken for granted by Democrats any longer,"" Avlon cautioned.

Political commentator Van Jones agreed that Democrats were losing with Hispanics concerned about the economy and socially conservative issues.



""Democrats don’t see this coming, we overreact to the cultural moves, under-react to the economic appeal and you’re seeing a pay-off for MAGA,"" Jones began.

He described Trump’s populist appeal and Republican wins on the issue of Critical Race Theory in schools as a ""MAGA threat"" stealing away voters from the Democratic Party.

TEXAS DEMOCRATS SLAM PARTY AFTER REPUBLICAN MAYRA FLORES FLIPS HOUSE SEAT: TAKING LATINOS ‘FOR GRANTED’

Jones said Democrats' messaging made them appear out-of-touch to middle class minority voters.

""I have never met a ‘Latinx.’ I’ve never met a ‘BIPOC' (""Black and Indigenous People of Color""). This is obviously weird stuff that these highly educated people say, its bizarre,"" Jones said, referring to the ""weird"" terms progressives use to appeal to young, college-educated liberals.

Latino voters have rejected the politically correct term ""Latinx"" preferred by some Democrats, with one 2021 poll showing only 2% of Hispanic voters even use it. The poll also showed 40% of Latinos were bothered by the term, and 30% said it would turn them off from voting for a candidate who used the term.

AOC ACCUSES PEOPLE OF CREATING DRAMA OVER THE WORD ‘LATINX’ DESPITE OVERWHELMING OPPOSITION TO THE TERM

The CNN political commentator also criticized Democrats for smearing all Republicans as racists and making assumptions about Black and Hispanic voters.

""The normal narrative in America has been all Black and Brown people hate racists, all Republicans are racist so all Black and Brown voters are going to vote for Democrats. All of that doesn’t make sense in the real world. All Republicans are not racist and Republican appeals are not just racial, some of them are economic, some of them are cultural and all Black and Brown folks are not liberals,"" Jones argued.

The same group resurfaced later on Thursday night after the Capitol complex was closed to public visitors and Fox News is told that they took videos and pictures around the offices of two Republican members of Congress, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.

A senior source in the U.S House of Representatives told Fox News that seven individuals associated with Stephen Colbert's show were arrested.

LAWMAKERS WANT ANSWERS AFTER STEPHEN COLBERT EMPLOYEES ARRESTED AT CAPITOL FOR UNLAWFUL ENTRY

The group was unescorted and charged with illegal entry to House office buildings after hours.

Fox News is told that the ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" team applied to get press credentials for the Jan. 6 hearing, but the House Radio/TV Gallery rejected the request because they are not considered ""news."" The issue didn't go to the Radio/TV Correspondents Association, which usually handles credentialing.

In addition to a regular Capitol Hill press pass, a special ""overlay"" is required for members of the press who want to be in the room for the Jan. 6 Committee hearings.

Members of Colbert's team could have been in House office buildings if they were invited, which they were. Fox News is told that Colbert's team conducted interviews earlier on Thursday with members of the Jan. 6 Committee, including Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. and Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla. They also interviewed Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass.

When Capitol Police spotted members of Colbert's team at the Jan. 6 Committee area, they were schooled away, and left the House office building.

At some point, they were let back in to the Longworth House Office Building sometime after 4 p.m. by an aide to Auchincloss and were unattended for several hours. Sources tell Fox News that the aide believed the group had more interviews to do.

Sources tell Fox News that the group apparently roamed the House office buildings while they were unattended for hours.

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has taken issue with predecessor Henry Kissinger’s comments regarding his opinion about Ukraine returning to a ""status quo ante"" to negotiate peace with Russia.

""Ukraine is a free and independent nation and is sovereign over all its land,"" Pompeo told Fox News Digital. ""Ukraine should not be pressured by its partners and allies. This besieged country and its suffering people need our support.""

Kissinger told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, ""Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante,"" which many have interpreted as meaning the division of territory prior to Russia’s invasion.

That concession would leave Crimea in Russian possession.

Pompeo countered that assessment while speaking at the Tikvah Fund’s Jewish Leadership Conference on Sunday, saying, ""Dr. Kissinger just has this one wrong.""

But he went further and told Fox News Digital that the U.S. needs to support Ukraine as the European nation determines its own course.

""Ukraine must possess the means to synchronize all elements of its armed power,"" Pompeo explained. ""This will prove determinative in this war. This capability will support Ukraine’s future as an independent nation, which governs its borders, as well as the future stability of Europe and world markets.

""This is what we must help Ukraine achieve,"" he added. ""We must, with our NATO allies, see that Ukraine has all that it needs to save precious lives. This must be done with American aid but not with any American boots on the ground.""

The former secretary stressed that any negotiations that seek to appease Russia will only embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin with future ambitions.

UKRAINE GRANTED EU CANDIDATE STATUS, FIRST STEP TOWARD MEMBERSHIP

""Putin feeds on weakness, but Ukraine has shown none,"" Pompeo said. ""Any vacillation in support of Kyiv will only encourage Putin to try to occupy illegally more sovereign land.

""Such Russian aggression if left to stand will, in all likelihood, envelop other nations,"" he continued. ""We have to aid Ukraine and make it crystal clear to Russia that Putin’s unconscionable war will fail in all its objectives.""

Russia has found itself in a stronger position now that the ruble has recovered its value, even exceeding its pre-invasion value. Pompeo criticized nations who are ""friends"" of the U.S. but continue to buy Russian oil and gas, which ""fuels Putin’s war machine.""

The federal government could take action against U.S. airlines on behalf of customers, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Saturday.

Many Americans have endured delays, cancelations, and other travel complications during the coronavirus pandemic, and in recent months, after many pandemic-related travel restrictions were lifted.

Following Buttigieg’s own flight being canceled, forcing him to drive from Washington to New York, he said his department has authority to enforce action against airlines that do not sufficiently maintain consumer-protection standards, potentially requiring them to hire more staff.

""That is happening to a lot of people, and that is exactly why we are paying close attention here to what can be done and how to make sure that the airlines are delivering,"" Buttigieg said during an interview with The Associated Press Saturday.

A Boston-area group that opposes Israel is facing accusations of antisemitic ""scapegoating"" and conspiracy theorizing after it promoted a project that alleged ties between Jewish groups, the media, and government institutions, while posting their addresses online.

BDS Boston, which supports the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, posted an endorsement of the Mapping Project, claiming that various organizations and institutions are ""structurally tied"" to police, American imperialism, evictions, and the oppression of Palestinians.

The project features a map with markers for 482 agencies, organizations, media outlets, and politicians, including local police departments, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, Massachusetts Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, the Boston Globe, and groups such as the Jewish Teen Foundation of Greater Boston, Jewish Arts Collaborative, and the Synagogue Council of Massachusetts.

FIRST ON FOX: New documents exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital reveal that the U.S. Army is teaching West Point cadets critical race theory (CRT), including addressing ""whiteness.""

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained the documents from government watchdog group Judicial Watch, whichhad to sue the military twice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to get the information.

""Our military is under attack – from within,"" Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in the press release. ""These documents show racist, anti-American CRT propaganda is being used to try to radicalize our rising generation of Army leadership at West Point.""

MICHIGAN DAD, A MARINE VET, SAYS CRITICAL RACE THEORY CONTRARY TO VALUES LEARNED IN MILITARY

Fitton told Fox News Digital that the material was obtained as part of a request for documents related to the instruction of cadets.

Judicial Watch received over 600 pages of documents from the two lawsuits that were levied after the Department of Defense (DOD) did not comply with the legally-binding requests for documents.

The documents reveal that the Army officers-in-training are receiving lessons on CRT, which included lessons on addressing ""whiteness"" as well as the application of CRT when answering questions.

""In order to understand racial inequality and slavery, it is first necessary to address whiteness,"" one slide reads .

The slide goes on to claim that ""whiteness"" is ""a location of structural advantage, of race privilege,"" is a ""standpoint or place from which white people look at themselves and the rest of society,"" and refers ""to a set of cultural practices that are usually unmarked and unnamed.""

""Do you think Affirmative Action creates an environment for ‘reverse discrimination?’"" one question reads . ""Use CRT to support your answer.""

""What is the difference between desegregation versus integration?"" another question from a slide titled "" Conundrums of Integration "" asks. ""How would you apply a tenant [sic] of CRT to this idea?""

Additionally, slides from an Army memo claim that White Americans ""have primarily benefited from civil rights legislation,"" that racism ""is ordinary,"" and that race is ""socially constructed,"" as well as address ""Queer Theory and Policy"" in another slide.

Another slide titled "" By The Numbers "" includes a graphic titled ""Modern Day Slavery in the USA"" juxtaposed with claims that Black Americans are ""less likely than whites"" to receive ""recommended medical screening tests"" or receive ""a job promotion"" while being more likely than White Americans to be murdered, incarcerated, or live ""below the poverty line.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the DOD for comment on the documents but did not receive a response.

953,The 5 biggest Supreme Court cases awaiting rulings,Ronn Blitzer,"

The Supreme Court's term is drawing to a close in the coming weeks, and the most anticipated rulings will be handed down during this time.

About 18 decisions are still pending before the Supreme Court, covering some of the most divisive and impactful issues facing the country. Here are the ones that are arguably the most significant.

5. Kennedy v. Bremerton School District

High school football coach Joseph Kennedy lost his job after he insisted on reciting post-game prayers on the 50-year-line, despite his employer, the Bremerton School District, instructing him to stop. Kennedy is claiming this violated his First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion, while the school district claims that a prayer from a public school employee ran afoul of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.

The school district told Kennedy to stop reciting prayers on the field after an opposing coach brought it to the principal's attention. He did, temporarily, then notified the school that he would resume the practice. The situation garnered media attention, and when Kennedy announced that he would go back to praying on the field, it raised security concerns. When he did pray after the game, a number of people stormed the field in support.

CONSERVATIVE SCOTUS JUSTICES OFFER TACIT SUPPORT FOR FOOTBALL COACH'S ON-FIELD PRAYER

The school district then offered to let Kennedy pray in other locations before and after games, or for him to pray on the 50-yard line after everyone else had left the premises, but he refused, insisting that he would continue his regular practice. This eventually led to the school district taking action against him.

At issue is whether Kennedy's prayer constituted government speech because he was a government employee, in which case it would not be protected. The court is also looking at whether, if the prayer is protected private speech, the school could still tell him to stop so that they would not be viewed as endorsing religion.

During oral arguments, a number of justices appeared to lean toward Kennedy's side. Justice Clarence Thomas questioned whether Kennedy's prayer could be viewed as government speech if the school district strongly and publicly opposed it.

Justice Elena Kagan raised the issue of possible coercion, as students had been joining Kennedy for the prayer. A lower court opinion noted that the principal had been contacted by a parent who said his son ""felt compelled to participate"" in the prayer despite being an atheist, ""he felt he wouldn't get to play as much if he didn't participate.""

Kennedy's attorney countered that by arguing that the school district never mentioned that when they fired him, and that their only reason at the time was concern for endorsing religion.

4. Biden v. Texas

This case centers on the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly known as the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy under which migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. had to stay in Mexico as they awaited hearings. The Biden administration tried to repeal the policy but was blocked by a lower court.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER ‘REMAIN IN MEXICO’ BORDER POLICY

The crux of the case is whether the federal government can use discretion in carrying out the program or if, as Texas and Missouri are arguing in their lawsuit, the policy is needed to comply with federal law that says migrants cannot be released into the U.S. because the country lacks resources to detain everyone.

Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar claimed during oral arguments that if the policy was needed to comply with the law, then ""every presidential administration in an unbroken line for the past quarter century has been in open violation[.]""

Much of the argument was over statutory language. Prelogar pointed to a statute that said the attorney general ""may return"" aliens from contiguous territory back to that territory while they await a hearing. Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out that the same statute says that if an immigration officer determines that a migrant ""is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted"" to the U.S., the migrant ""shall be detained,"" which the other side was interpreting as a requirement.

3. New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen

In possibly the biggest Second Amendment case before the Supreme Court in more than a decade, the justices are poised to decide whether New York's process for obtaining a license to carry a concealed handgun is overly restrictive. The current rules require applicants to show ""proper cause"" for why they need to carry a firearm, and the government can exercise discretion in determining whether someone has satisfied that requirement. The result is that it is extremely difficult to obtain a license.

SENATE GUN NEGOTIATORS COULD HAVE BILL TEXT MONDAY, AS TALKS PICK UP STEAM IN WAKE OF MASS SHOOTINGS

During oral arguments, conservative justices appeared to challenge the state's position.

""Why isn’t it good enough to say I live in a violent area and I want to defend myself?"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked.

In an exchange with Justice Samuel Alito, New York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood recognized that if an applicant stated that to leave work late at night and have to walk from a subway station through a high-crime neighborhood to get home, that person would be denied because they did not cite a specific threat.

""How is that consistent with the core right to self-defense?"" Alito asked, stating that this is at the core of the Second Amendment.

2. West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency

While this case – which is actually four cases consolidated to be decided together – is not centered on hot-button political issues but on the much drier world of agency action, its outcome can perhaps have the greatest impact of all of these cases.

At issue is whether the Environmental Protection Agency has the power to issue sweeping rules that could overhaul industry practices and the country's electricity grids to address climate change.

In 2015, the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan aimed to reduce carbon emissions at power plants. The plan was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2016, and then repealed by the Trump administration and replaced by the less extreme Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. After President Biden took office, however, the ACE Rule became the subject of litigation that led to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacating that rule as well as the repeal of the Clean Power Plan.

The Supreme Court is now reviewing that decision.

The Biden administration argues that the EPA has the authority to unilaterally enact broad requirements to improve the environment. West Virginia and other states argue that this runs afoul of the ""major questions doctrine."" This doctrine says that even though federal agencies generally have broad rule-making power as delegated by Congress through the statutes that create them, when it comes to issues of major economic and political significance to the country those statutes need to have clear language to support the agency’s action.

The Biden administration is also claiming that the case does not even belong before the Supreme Court because the EPA has said that it will not reinstate the Clean Power Plan, opting instead to develop and implement its own rules. The government argued that without any EPA rule currently in place, the other side is merely litigating over a potential future rule, not any actual current harm.

The case could determine the fate of President Biden's climate agenda, as well as set significant precedent for how other federal agencies can act.

1. Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization

The anticipation for a ruling in this case has already led to protests outside the Supreme Court and the homes of several justices, as well as an attempted murder charge against a man who allegedly plotted to kill Justice Kavanaugh. This was all sparked by the publication of a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito that, if published as the court's opinion, will overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion.

The case came about after Mississippi passed a law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, blatantly going against the standard set by Roe that prohibited bans prior to fetal viability – understood to be at about 23 weeks. The ensuing litigation now puts the Supreme Court in a position to review whether a pre-viability ban should be allowed.

PRO-LIFERS TARGETS OVER 40 TIMES IN ATTACKS, VANDALISM, HARASSMENT SINCE SUPREME COURT LEAK, GROUP SAYS

During oral arguments, some justices appeared interested in finding a way to uphold the 15-week ban without completely doing away with Roe. Chief Justice John Roberts spoke of possibly eliminating the viability standard while still ensuring that women have an opportunity to get an abortion. Both sides of the case expressed skepticism that this was a workable option.

Alito, in his draft opinion, not only said Mississippi's law should stand, but eviscerated Roe and the case that upheld it, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He bluntly said the cases should be overruled, which would put abortion rights in the hands of individual states where elected officials can set their own standards.

After Politico published Alito's draft, the Supreme Court issued a statement noting that it is normal practice for draft opinions to be circulated among the justices as part of the decision-making process, and that the draft does not indicate what the Court's final ruling will be.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The country will now wait and see if Alito's draft, or something similar to it, will do away with Roe v. Wade after nearly 50 years, or if the Supreme Court ultimately decides to go in a different direction.

Last week alone the court released opinions in 11 cases, so if they continue at that pace these cases will all be decided by the end of next week. The court's current term will end once all cases are decided, at which point Justice Stephen Breyer will retire. His replacement, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, will then be sworn in.",https://www.foxnews.com
954,"Florida homeowner speaks out after teens break in to $8 million mansion, throw massive rager",Rebecca Rosenberg,"

FIRST ON FOX: The Florida owner of an $8 million home that became the site of a wild, unauthorized house party, said the revelers stole a $1500 bottle of wine, a $3,500 Yves Saint Laurent purse and a football signed by former Colts quarterback Peyton Manning.

""They went in every inch of my home, every drawer,"" said the owner of the Santa Rosa mansion, who lives there full-time with her husband, 10-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter. ""They were trying on my clothes, my shoes, my swimsuit. They stole my handbags."" The haul included the YSL, as well as Gucci and Stella McCartney purses.

The woman, who asked that her family not be identified by name, said their older kids, who are 15 and 20, do not go to school in Florida and did not know the teens at the party.

""It’s not the material things, it’s the memories,"" said the stay-at-home mom, whose husband is an oil executive. ""The amount of invasion of privacy was just – there was no regard for anything. It was a complete violation.""

FLORIDA TEENS BREAK IN TO $8M HOME FOR WILD PARTY, POST ABOUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA

The family was out of town when the rowdy crowd of about 200 — many of whom attend local high schools — broke in and ransacked the house on Blackwater Street, which is listed for sale on Zillow for $7,950,000.

As music blasted and teens downed booze, the foyer of the five-bedroom, eight-bathroom home was turned into a boxing ring for a match, cellphone clips show.

The owners are avid wine and liquor collectors, and the teens raided their cellar, downing a $1500 bottle of Ace of Spade champagne, snatching a bottle of 1942 Don Julio tequila and dozens of other bottles valued at thousands of dollars.

""They were in every single one of our beds,"" the owner said. ""They were in all my children’s beds, they were in our bed. There were footprints in our bathtub.""

Their son’s Yeezy sneakers and his PlayStation 4 were stolen, while their daughter’s playroom was wrecked. ""She’s a big American Girl lover, and they tore all her toys up and threw the baby dolls that she loves on the roof,"" the mom said.

The home was accessed through accordion doors that face the backyard.

The three locks on the doors were pried off, then the front door was opened to let the revelers in, according to the owner. The community of WaterColor, an upscale subdivision in Santa Rosa Beach, has 24-hour security patrol.

The teens circulated a flyer advertising the Friday night rager five days prior, according to Walton County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Corey Dobridnia.

""We don’t know how they knew the home would be empty,"" said Dobridnia, noting that the family left town Wednesday but had a house guest who was there until Friday afternoon.

""It’s bizarre,"" she remarked. The police were called to the property Saturday morning due to a noise complaint. The owners were contacted and rushed home.

The teens posted videos of the illicit bash to TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram — but most of the content has since expired or been deleted, Dobridnia said.

""We have identified many of the people in the videos,"" she added. ""What we’re trying to do right now is identify who was responsible for the burglary.""

Most of the teens are local and some were given up by their parents, school officials and neighboring police departments.

The same morning of the house party, sheriff’s deputies were shot at during a gas station robbery.

""They’ve wasted our resources, our time, when we had a suspect shooting at deputies the same night,"" Dobridnia said. ""It’s just absolutely absurd.""

Charlie Sheen reversed his stance on his 18-year-old daughter Sami joining OnlyFans, thanks to his ex-wife, Denise Richards, after initially saying he didn't ""condone"" the idea.

""Denise has illuminated a variety of salient points, that in my haste, i overlooked and dismissed,"" Sheen said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. ""Now more than ever, it’s essential that Sami have a united parental front to rely upon, as she embarks on this new adventure. From this moment forward, she’ll have it abundantly.""

Sami, who has nearly 200,000 followers total across every major social media platform, turned 18 in March. She recently moved back in with her mother following turbulent times between the pair, who have since seemed to mend their relationship.

Sami announced earlier this month that she had plans to join the subscription-based service, known for its adult content, where creators can post photos and videos for monetary income. Bella Thorne, Blac Chyna, Cardi B, Carmen Electra and Amber Rose are just a few celebrities with accounts on the site.

Richards once again defended Sami’s choice on Instagram Friday as she addressed her eldest daughter’s decision to join the site after initially declaring: ""Sami I will always support you & always have your back.""

""Lots of negative comments on my social this past week. I have to say, I wish I had the confidence my 18 yr old daughter has. And I also can't be judgmental of her choices,"" Richards wrote. ""I did Wild Things & Playboy, quite frankly her father shouldn't be either.""

She added: ""And to be able to ignore the negativity at her age? It took me many years & I still sometimes struggle. I'm in awe of her ability to be able to shut out the noise. Because it can destroy you.""

Richards shared that she just learned about the online service a few months ago and said she might start her own OnlyFans.

""Is it so bad to control it & monetize it too? I'm sorry, but s— if I can get paid and at my age? To see me in a bikini?!? God bless you. Perhaps I should open my own account."" she continued.

Last year, Sami claimed in a since-deleted TikTok that she was ""trapped"" in an ""abusive home"" living with her mom and Richards' new husband Aaron Phypers. She subsequently moved in with Sheen and stopped attending school.

In February, the former ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star told SiriusXM’s Jeff Lewis that they had a strained relationship, which was ""very difficult.""

""Obviously I would love for her to live with me,"" Richards said. ""She lived with me all these years. But I think it's very difficult raising teenagers now and especially in Los Angeles when there's access to everything. We didn't grow up with Postmates and Uber, where you have everything that you want. There are certain rules and I enforce them. And there's different rules at that [Sheen's] house and that's OK.""

Sami and Denise have since reconciled and are back together living under one roof.

""They are getting along very well,"" a source said at the time, adding that Sami ""loves her dad.""

Sheen and Richards married in 2002 before splitting in 2006. They also share a 17-year-old daughter named Lola Rose Sheen.

956,'Second pandemic'? Biden alarms Twitter with his cryptic comments: 'Here we go again',Gabriel Hays,"

During presidential remarks on COVID-19 vaccines for children under 5 years old, President Joe Biden alarmed Twitter users when he spoke of the government preparing for a ""second pandemic.""

A reporter prompted Biden’s head-turning remarks with a question on what spending the U.S. government is still prepared to do in order to manufacture and distribute more vaccines and maintain the infrastructure necessary to combat COVID-19 as it lingers throughout the country.

Last week, the CDC and FDA authorized emergency use of the COVID-19 vaccine for kids as young as 6 months old.

""I know you’re looking for more money from Congress for this vaccine campaign and for COVID funding going into the fall,"" the reporter told Biden, before asking, ""How much of the supply of vaccines for these small children is there and how many of the nation’s kids will you be able to get vaccinated before you need more money from Congress?""

PARENTS NOW TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL GET THEIR CHILDREN VACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19

Biden responded, ""We’ll get through at least this year,"" before stating, ""We do need more money. But we don’t just need more money for vaccines for children eventually. We need more money to plan for the second pandemic.""

Biden reinforced his revelation: ""There’s going to be another pandemic. We have to think ahead.""

For good measure he slammed the Trump administration, and propped up his own, saying, ""And that’s not something the last outfit did very well. That’s something we’ve been doing fairly well – that’s why we need the money.""

Though Twitter users were mystified and annoyed with Biden’s warnings of ""another pandemic.""

""Right in time for 2024,"" tweeted Fox News contributor and New York Post writer Miranda Devine, insinuating another pandemic may interfere with the upcoming election.

Conservative commentator Ian Miles Cheong expressed confusion about Biden’s statements, wondering, ""Biden said he needed more money to deal with a second pandemic. What did he mean by this?""

Conservative radio host Tara Servatius tweeted, ""Here's the Biden Administration telling us they are planning to hold another pandemic, almost as if they can control the disease. 3 weeks ago, Fauci announced it would occur in the fall ... which corresponds perfectly with the midterm election.""

""Sounds like a threat,"" remarked The Federalist CEO Sean Davis.

957,Bipartisan Senate gun bill gets icy reception from House Republicans,Tyler Olson,"

The bipartisan Senate gun bill cleared a procedural vote Tuesday with support from more than a quarter of Senate Republicans, including top party leaders. But by Wednesday it was clear it wouldn't get the same reception from House Republicans.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., announced he would formally whip against it. House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said the bill ""shreds the Constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans with no effect on deterring criminals."" And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., will oppose the bill, his office confirmed.

""In an effort to slowly chip away at law-abiding citizens’ 2nd Amendment rights, this legislation takes the wrong approach in attempting to curb violent crimes,"" Scalise said in a whip notice Wednesday.

SCALISE TO WHIP HOUSE REPUBLICANS AGAINST SENATE GUN BILL

""Since Biden's election, Democrats have failed at every level. There's literally only one way Republicans can lose the midterms,"" Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said in a press conference. ""That's exactly what these 14 RINOs, Republicans in name only, have done in the Senate.""

She called the bill unconstitutional and said Republicans would try to defund it if it passes.

Officially titled the ""Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,"" the senators involved in the bill released the final text of it Tuesday night after weeks of negotiations.

SENATE VOTES TO ADVANCE BIPARTISAN GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION

The bill would provide funding for states to create programs that could keep weapons away from people who are dangers to themselves or others, often called red flag laws. It would also enhance background checks for gun buyers under 21, add penalties for some gun criminals and provide funding for a variety of health and mental health-related programs.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the top GOP negotiator on the bill, has emphasized that it ""will not infringe on any law-abiding American’s Second Amendment rights."" And Senate Republicans who support the bill are also highlighting what they say are negotiating wins, including that the bill doesn't expand background checks and will include due process requirements for red flag laws.

But multiple House GOP sources said the bill is unlikely to get broad support in the current political environment.

GUN BILL DETAILS AGREED TO BY BIPARTISAN GROUP OF FOUR KEY SENATE NEGOTIATORS

One GOP aide said there’s a good chance the gun bill gets even less House Republican support than the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which garnered 13 GOP votes. The aide said that because red flag laws are so ""demonized"" among conservatives, it will be very hard for most Republicans to vote for the bill.

But at least some are expected to, including Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, who announced Tuesday that he will vote for it.

""My name is Tony Gonzales and I am a survivor of domestic abuse, my stepfather would come home drunk & beat on me and my mother,"" Gonzales said on Twitter. ""One night he decided that wasn’t enough and shoved a shotgun in my mother’s mouth. I was 5 at the time and not strong enough to fend off the wolves.""

Gonzales added: ""As a Congressman it’s my duty to pass laws that never infringe on the Constitution while protecting the lives of the innocent. In the coming days I look forward to voting YES on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.""

Fox News is told the floor is five to six GOP yeas. But that number could grow as high as 15-17 GOP yeas.

Either way, that will not come to nearly as high a percentage of the Senate Republicans who are expected to vote ""yea"" on final passage for the bipartisan gun bill later this week.

958,Migrant encounters at southern border sets new record as Biden prepares to end Title 42,Louis Casiano,"

Border agents encountered nearly 235,000 migrants at the southern border in April, according to a Monday court filing, which accounts for the highest number of encounters in the history of the Department of Homeland Security.

The numbers come as the Biden administration prepares to end Title 42, a Trump-era public health order that allowed authorities to turn away migrants at the border.

FEDERAL JUDGE EXPECTED TO RULE ON TITLE 42 WITHIN DAYS

Also in April, 117,989 migrants were released into the United States and 113,248 were removed. Of that, 98,908 were expelled via Title 42.

Border officials are bracing for an influx of migrants when the health order expires on May 23 if a Louisiana federal court does not hand down a ruling on its fate. In Texas, migrant groups are seen illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico daily.

A DHS source told Fox News that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Del Rio Sector in Texas saw 1,288 illegal crossings within the past 24 hours and such events were up nearly 150% since Oct. 1, 2021.

Texas has been especially aggressive in combating the flow of migrants to its communities. Aside from having the National Guard and other authorities present at the border to deter smugglers, the state has bused more than 900 migrants to Washington D.C. since April.

The move is an effort to bring the issue to the Biden administration, which Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has criticized for not doing more to secure the border.

In a recent interview , Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told Fox News he isn't surprised Biden won't be traveling to the border when he leaves for his trip to Asia later this week.

""He constantly tries to deflect on what's going on at the border, and that's extremely disappointing because if he does not face-up and look at what the reality is, we're just going to continue in this situation,"" Judd told ""America Reports.""

""And it's not just going to [be] like we're going to continue right now… It's going to get worse, especially when Title 42 goes away. Once Title 42 goes completely away, we're in some serious trouble.""

""It's a sad day to be a Raven I must say,"" Lewis said.

Indianapolis Colts team owner Jim Irsay also tweeted his condolences after learning about Siragusa’s death.

""The Goose, Tony Siracusa (sic) has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation,"" he wrote.

Ravens team owner Steve Bisciotti and others would put out statements through the team on Siragusa's passing.

""Renee and I are stunned and heartbroken to learn about the sudden passing of Tony Siragusa,"" Bisciotti said. ""He was a special person and clearly one of the most popular players in Ravens history. Tony’s larger-than-life personality made an enormous impact on our organization and throughout the Baltimore community.

""On the football field, Goose was a difference-maker who contributed immeasurably to the success of many great Ravens defenses, including the record-setting 2000 Super Bowl team.

""Our deepest prayers and sympathies go out to Kathy, their three children and the rest of the Siragusa family.

""This is a tremendously sad day for the Baltimore Ravens. We appreciate everyone who has expressed an outpouring of support for our players, coaches and staff.""

Siragusa joined the Colts in 1990 as an undrafted free agent. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, native was a nose tackle and a defensive tackle for the Colts for seven seasons. He played 96 games for the organization and recorded 16.5 sacks from 1990 to 1996.

He joined the Ravens in 1997 and played for them until 2001. He, alongside players like Ray Lewis, Jamal Lewis, Rod Woodson and Jamie Sharper, defeated the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV.

""This is a tough one. I love Goose like a brother. From the first day we met, I knew that life was different. I knew he was someone who would change my life forever. He was a one-of-a-kind person who made you feel important and special. You can never replace a man like that,"" Ray Lewis said.

960,Florida meningococcal outbreak among gay and bisexual men is one of worst in US history: CDC,Shiv Sudhakar,"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating one of the worst meningococcal outbreaks among gay and bisexual men in U.S. history, according to a recent press release.

""Getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease is the best way to prevent this serious illness, which can quickly become deadly,"" said Dr. José R. Romero, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

""Because of the outbreak in Florida, and the number of Pride events being held across the state in coming weeks, it’s important that gay and bisexual men who live in Florida get vaccinated, and those traveling to Florida talk to their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine .""

The agency has reported at least 24 cases and 6 deaths among gay and bisexual men related to this disease, with approximately half of the outbreak cases among Hispanic men.

CDC PANEL RECOMMENDS SENIORS GET NEWER FLU VACCINES

The cases related to the current outbreak are most among those who live in Florida but also affected some who traveled to the state.

The CDC recommends the MenACWY vaccine, which protects against meningococcal disease caused by four strains of the meningococcal bacteria – A, C, W and Y.

The agency noted all HIV patients should be routinely immunized with the MenACWY vaccine.

The outbreak is caused by serotype C, but there are six serotypes that cause the disease worldwide, although mainly serotypes B, C and Y cause most of meningococcal cases in the United States.

WHO MEETING ON MONKEYPOX, POSSIBLE GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY

The CDC is also monitoring a monkeypox outbreak in countries that normally don’t report the disease, with early data showing high numbers among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.

As of June 23, 173 monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases have been reported in the United States, including approximately 16 Florida cases, per the CDC website.

Meningococcal disease is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis .

Approximately 10% of people are colonized with the bacteria in the back of their nose and throat, which means they are ""carriers"" who harbor the bacteria in their body without being sick.

It is spread by close contact usually through coughing, kissing or prolonged contact.

It is not as contagious as cold or flu germs, so people don’t get infected with the bacteria through ""casual contact"" or breathing the air where someone with active meningococcal disease has been.

But when the bacteria invades the body, it can cause two main illness: septicemia, where the bacteria invades the bloodstream and causes organ damage; and meningitis, which is an inflammation of the protective membranes (known as the meninges) that cover the brain and spinal cord.

Typical symptoms of meningitis may start as flu-like symptoms that rapidly progress into a fever, headache and a stiff neck as the bacteria infect the protective lining of the brain and spinal cord.

Meningococcal septicemia, also known as meningococcemia, causes bleeding into the skin and other organs as the bacteria multiply and destroy the walls of blood vessels, which often leads to a dusky, purple rash in the later stages of the disease.

Septicemia symptoms also include fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, cold extremities, rapid breathing and severe aches in the muscles, joints, chest or belly.

""People can find a meningococcal vaccine by contacting their doctor’s office, pharmacy, community health center, or local health department. Insurance providers should pay for meningococcal vaccination for those whom it is recommended for during an outbreak. In Florida, anyone can get a MenACWY vaccine at no cost at any county health department during the outbreak,"" the CDC said.",https://www.foxnews.com
961,Biden campaign promises included decriminalizing HIV exposure,Caitlin Mcfall,"

President-elect Joe Biden has promised to ""advance LGBTQ equality"" by reversing decades-old criminalization of HIV exposure and transmission laws that have no ""scientific basis"" and contribute to stigmas.

Biden said he supports legislation like U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee’s REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act, which seeks to ""modernize"" laws and policies in 26 states that have HIV exposure laws and characterize the ""blood, semen and saliva"" of people living with HIV as a ""deadly weapon"" – though as pointed out in the bill, HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva.

BIDEN TO ISSUE EXECUTIVE ORDER HALTING ANY TRUMP 'MIDNIGHT REGULATIONS'

""These laws perpetuate discrimination and stigma towards people with HIV/AIDS, and there is simply no ""scientific basis"" for them,"" Biden said in his plans to better LGBTQ policies.

Currently, 37 states have laws that criminalize HIV exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Lee’s bill calls for Congress to implement new policies that would require the attorney general, secretary of health and human services, and the secretary of defense to review state and federal laws, including military policies, addressing regulations and criminal charges surrounding the exposure or transmission of HIV.

The California Democrat’s legislation also points to how the United Nations has adapted its language to encourage the de-stigmatization of HIV by enforcing only ""intentional transmission,"" where an individual can be charged for acting ""with the intention to transmit HIV, and does in fact transmit it.""

The bill argues that updating policies such as these would then take into consideration scientific advances like antiretroviral medications, which allow the virus to run on almost ""undetectable levels"" and make the transmission rate ""near zero"" – which is not taken into account under current criminal laws.

States like California and Washington have passed legislation to reduce the penalty from knowingly transmitting HIV from a felony charge to a misdemeanor.

While opponents to reducing charges argue there is an increased likelihood that knowingly transmitted HIV is spread from person to person, supporters say such law revisions would decrease discrimination – a sentiment echoed by former President Obama in 2010.

BIDEN TRAILS TRUMP, OBAMA AND BUSH IN DRAGGING FEET TO NAME ATTORNEY GENERAL PICK

""While we understand the intent behind these laws, they may not have the desired effect and they may make people less willing to disclose their status by making people feel at even greater risk of discrimination,"" Obama said in a National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

""In many instances, the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment,"" the statement continued.

Biden has selected members of his future administration that reflect his intended commitment to LGBTQ communities in choosing two lesbian officals to serve in his administration -- including Karine Jean-Pierre, former chief of staff for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who has been selected as deputy press secretary, and Pili Tobar, a former aide to Senat Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who will serve as deputy White House communications director, according to NBC News.

962,Twitter slams Gov. Hochul’s anger over SCOTUS gun ruling: ‘Sorry the Constitution happened to you’,Gabriel Hays,"

Conservatives on Twitter slammed Governor Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., after she railed against the Supreme Court ruling which overturned New York’s restrictive concealed carry firearm regulations.

After the Supreme Court issued a ruling on Thursday which struck down the state’s tough regulations regarding those seeking a concealed carry permit, a defiant Governor Hochul made a televised address to her citizens denouncing the decision.

During the press conference, Hochul claimed the Supreme Court ""has stripped away the State of New York’s right and responsibility to protect its citizens."" She added that the decision is ""frightful in its scope"" and ""sending us backwards in our efforts to protect families and prevent gun violence.""

One moment of Hochul’s speech – around seven minutes in – went viral. The governor stated, ""I’m sorry this dark day has come, that we’re supposed to go back to what was in place since 1788 when the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified. And I would like to point out to the Supreme Court justices that the only weapons at the time were muskets. I’m prepared to go back to muskets.""

PRESIDENT BIDEN REACTS TO SUPREME COURT HANDING GUN OWNERS A MAJOR 2ND AMENDMENT WIN

MRCTV host Brittany Hughes slammed Hochul’s point, responding, ""And the only politicians at that time were men. Your point?""

""If Kathy Hochul's security detail doesn't set an example by switching to only using muskets first... then she can f--- right off,"" Washington Times columnist Tim Young tweeted.

Former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller asked, ""Will the criminals rampaging freely across New York be going back to muskets as well?"" He then posed another question to Hochul’s point, ""Also, out of curiosity, what medium is Hochul using to broadcast this message and did it exist in the 18th century?""

Conservative author Carmine Sabia blasted Hochul’s talking point as well, claiming, ""New York Gov. Kathy Hochul threatens that she is ‘prepared to go back to muskets’ as she appears determined to [violate] the Second Amendment.""

Conservative podcast host Monica Crowley asked, ""Hi @GovKathyHochul- remember when you were in Congress and proudly touted your ‘A’ rating from the NRA? Good times.""

In addition to the address, the governor tweeted her frustrations. ""It is outrageous that at a moment of national reckoning on gun violence, the Supreme Court has recklessly struck down a New York law that limits those who can carry concealed weapons,"" she wrote.

The Blaze reporter Jill Savage dinged Hochul’s tweet, commenting, ""Sorry the Constitution happened to you.""

Lawyer and conservative Matthew Kolken responded to Hochul’s tweet, writing, ""Take the loss, Kathy. Or we will see you back in Court.""

Conservative journalist Beth Baumann rebuked Hochul’s post, accusing her of wanting to leave Americans victimized. ""It's outrageous that you want sexual assault survivors like myself to prove we have a ‘need’ for a CCW, even though our past is proof enough. I know what that's like because I lived in your buddy Gavin Newsom's state at the time.""

963,"Black babysitter for white kids felt 'criminalized' after white woman called cops, he says",Lukas Mikelionis,"

A white woman called the police on a black man babysitting two white children and then following them home in Georgia.

Corey Lewis said the woman stopped him outside a Walmart in Cobb County on Sunday and demanded to speak to the kids to check if they were OK.

After refusing the woman’s requests, Lewis began live-streaming the encounter on Facebook, while the woman called the police on him and began following him back home.

Upon arriving at his home, he was met by a police officer who questioned why he was driving around with two white children.

""I didn’t know what was going on, what she wanted to do. I felt like my character was being criminalized."" — Corey Lewis

“I didn’t know what was going on, what she wanted to do,” Lewis told the New York Times. “I felt like my character was being criminalized.”

In the videos, Lewis is heard saying that he’s being “followed and harassed,” to which an officer replies, “I’ve heard.”

The police officer then questions the children, ages 6 and 10, and their parents David Parker and Dana Mango, who all backed up Lewis’ story.

“It just knocked us out of our chair,” Parker told the Times. “We felt horrible for Corey.”

The couple were stunned by the incident. They said Lewis, an “All-American Guy, is a family friend who runs a youth program that their sons is attending.

“B-W-B is the new thing, babysitting while black,” Parker said.

""B-W-B is the new thing, babysitting while black."" — David Parker, the children's father

The father said that while he wants to give the benefit of the doubt to the woman who called the police on Lewis, it was obvious that the children weren’t in any apparent danger as the babysitter was wearing a signature bright green T-shirt with his company’s logo.

“I don’t think you have to watch too many ‘Law & Order’ episodes to realize kidnappers don’t usually wear fluorescent green shirts,” he said.

Parker also said he’s proud of his daughter, who told a reporter that the woman who called the police on her babysitter should be less prejudiced next time.

“She said that, ‘I would just ask her to next time, try to see us as three people rather than three skin colors because we might’ve been Mr. Lewis’s adopted children,’” Parker said.

Lewis told the Times that he’s back working with the children again and that the incident won’t stop him from continuing his work. “You see these things, but they’re like from a distance,” he said. “But then for it to actually happen to you, it’s unbelievable.”

""Once I saw him actually connect and hit the employee in his head, I jumped in, grabbed him like I do in training here, put him down, flattened him like a pancake and then I tied him up like a pretzel in a position called ‘Gift Wrap’ or ‘Twisting Arm Control,’"" Redzovic told the station.

972,Supreme Court gun decision shoots down NY rule that set high bar for concealed carry licenses,Ronn Blitzer,"

The Supreme Court Thursday ruled 6-3 that New York’s regulations that made it difficult to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun were unconstitutionally restrictive, and that it should be easier to obtain such a license.

The existing standard required an applicant to show ""proper cause"" for seeking a license, and allowed New York officials to exercise discretion in determining whether a person has shown a good enough reason for needing to carry a firearm. Stating that one wished to protect themselves or their property was not enough.

""In this case, petitioners and respondents agree that ordinary, law-abiding citizens have a similar right to carry handguns publicly for their self-defense. We too agree, and now hold, consistent with Heller and McDonald, that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual’s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the Court's opinion, referencing two previous gun cases. ""Because the State of New York issues public-carry licenses only when an applicant demonstrates a special need for self-defense, we conclude that the State’s licensing regime violates the Constitution.""

Thomas noted that the state statute does not define what ""proper cause"" means, and that courts had ruled that the standard was met by people who showed a ""special need for self-protection.""

SUPREME COURT SIGNALS IT COULD STRIKE DOWN OR LIMIT RESTRICTIVE NY GUN PERMIT LAW

""This ‘special need’ standard is demanding,"" Thomas wrote. ""For example, living or working in an area ‘noted for criminal activity’ does not suffice.""

In 43 other states, Thomas noted, authorities are required to issue licenses to applicants who meet certain requirements, and officials do not have discretion to say no due to what they believe is an insufficient need.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that Thursday's ruling does not prohibit states from setting requirements to obtain a carry license, and that it ""addresses only the unusual discretionary licensing regimes[.]""

The case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, was the first major gun rights case before the Supreme Court in more than a decade. In the majority opinion, Thomas referenced 2010's McDonald v. City of Chicago and 2008's D.C. v. Heller in his reasoning for Thursday's ruling.

VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS HORSFORD, GOTTHEIMER EXPLAIN VOTES AGAINST BIPARTISAN SUPREME COURT SECURITY BILL

""As we stated in Heller and repeated in McDonald, ‘individual self-defense is ‘the central component’ of the Second Amendment right,’"" the justice cited. He also referenced how Heller made clear that restrictions on carrying guns in ""sensitive places"" is permissible, and how New York was wrong for arguing that it's law was merely doing just that.

""[W]e do think respondents err in their attempt to characterize New York’s proper-cause requirement as a ‘sensitive-place’ law,"" Thomas wrote, explaining that New York viewed ""sensitive places"" as anywhere ""where people typically congregate and where law-enforcement and other public-safety professionals are presumptively available.""

This definition, Thomas said, is too broad.

""Put simply, there is no historical basis for New York to effectively declare the island of Manhattan a ""sensitive place"" simply because it is crowded and protected generally by the New York City Police Department,"" he wrote.

The conservative justice also looked at the plain language of the Second Amendment, which protects the right ""to keep and bear arms."" He described keeping and bearing as two separate things, noting that Heller defines ""bear"" as ""to wear, bear, or carry."" This implies public carrying, Thomas said, because someone would not generally wear their gun in a holster at home, but would ""keep"" it somewhere.

The 63-page opinion also explored historical restrictions on carrying handguns that New York relied on. Thomas explained why they do not justify a current restriction, noting how past regulations from centuries ago focused on ""dangerous and unusual weapons,"" while handguns today are relatively commonplace. While the handgun may have been considering dangerous and unusual during colonial times, the opinion said, in modern times it is ""the quintessential self-defense weapon.""

SENATE VOTES TO ADVANCE BIPARTISAN GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION

The Court's opinion also stated that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms should not be held to a lower standard than other constitutional rights.

""We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need. That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense,"" Thomas wrote.

Justice Stephen Breyer wrote an impassioned dissenting opinion in which he referenced present-day fervor over gun violence, as well as recent events. Joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, Breyer cited statistics including 45,222 Americans killed by firearms in the U.S. in 2020, the number of mass shootings that have already taken place in 2022, and how gun violence is now the leading cause of death for children and adolescents.

""Many States have tried to address some of the dangers of gun violence just described by passing laws that limit, in various ways, who may purchase, carry, or use firearms of different kinds,"" Breyer wrote. ""The Court today severely burdens States’ efforts to do so.""

Justice Samuel Alito, in a concurring opinion, took issue with Breyer's references to recent shootings.

""Does the dissent think that laws like New York’s prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home?"" Alito asked. ""And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.""

Breyer recognized legitimate purposes for guns, such as sport, self-defense, or types of employment like security guards, but he said it is the responsibility of elected officials to balance ""these lawful uses against the dangers of firearms"" when crafting legislation.

The Thomas opinion drew comparisons between abortion and several other political issues that have been addressed by the Supreme Court in recent years.

""In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,"" Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion.

974,Biden calls on Congress to restore Roe v. Wade abortion protections as federal law: 'This is not over',Brooke Singman,"

President Biden on Friday urged Congress to restore the abortion protections of Roe v. Wade by codifying abortion rights into federal law after the Supreme Court Friday overturned the landmark decision, while urging protesters to remain peaceful and saying ""violence is never acceptable.""

The president, from the White House Friday, slammed the high court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which protected ""a woman’s right to choose"" and ""her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor, free from interference of politics.""

SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINION: LIVE UPDATES

Biden said Roe v. Wade ""reaffirmed basic principles of equality that women have the power to control their own destiny, and to reinforce the fundamental right of privacy.""

The president also said Roe v. Wade ""was a correct decision"" on a ""complex matter through a careful balance between a woman’s right to choose.""

""Let me be very clear and unambiguous: the only way we can secure a woman’s right to choose—the balance that existed—is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law,"" Biden said. ""No executive action from the president can do that.""

SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINION

The president said voters ""need to make their voices heard"" in November’s midterm elections, saying they ""must elect more senators, representatives who will codify a woman’s right to choose in the federal law once again.""

""Elect more state leaders to protect this right at the local level,"" he said. ""We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land. We need to elect officials who will do that.""

Biden said that this fall, ""Roe is on the ballot.""

""Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality—they’re all on the ballot,"" Biden said. ""Until then, I will do all in my power to protect a woman’s right in states where they will face the consequences of today’s decision.""

The president said that while the Supreme Court’s decision ""casts a dark shadow over large swaths of the land,"" there still are ""many states in this country that still recognize a woman’s right to choose.""

""So, if a woman lives in a state that restricts abortion, the Supreme Court’s decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home state to the state that allows it,"" Biden explained.

Meanwhile, the president urged ""everyone, no matter how deeply they care about this decision, to keep all protests peaceful, peaceful, peaceful, peaceful.""

TRUMP PRAISES SUPREME COURT DECISION OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE, SAYS RULING 'WILL WORK OUT FOR EVERYBODY'

""No intimidation. Violence is never acceptable,"" Biden stressed. ""Threats and intimidation are not speech. We must stand against violence in any form regardless your rationale.""

The president's plea for peaceful protests come amid promises from a pro-choice extremist group, ""Jane's Revenge,"" to deliver a ""NIGHT OF RAGE"" if the court overturns Roe v. Wade.

The group, which previously called for an ""open season"" against pro-life centers and has taken credit for dozens of attacks across the country, has threatened: ""To our oppressors: if abortions aren’t safe, you’re not either.""

Their threats come after an armed man was charged with the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He had told detectives he was upset over the leaked draft opinion.

Biden, last week, signed a Supreme Court protection bill that provides for 24-hour protection for Supreme Court justices' families.

On Friday, the president also said that while many are ""frustrated and disillusioned that the court has taken something away that's so fundamental, I know so many women are now going to face incredibly difficult situations.""

""I hear you. I support you. I stand with you,"" Biden said.

Criticizing the conservative majority of the high court, the president said shows ""how extreme it is"" and ""how far removed they are from the majority of this country.""

Former President Trump, during his administration, appointed conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

With those appointments, the high court became majority conservative, with Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett.

""They made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world,"" Biden said. ""But this decision must not be the final word.""

GOP SENATORS URGE DOJ, DHS TO TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT ABORTION-RELATED EXTREMIST VIOLENCE AFTER ROE OVERTURNED

Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elana Kagan, all appointed by Democratic presidents, dissented the majority opinion Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Meanwhile, Biden said his administration will ""use all of its appropriate lawful powers,"" but urged Congress to ""act with your vote.""

""You can act. You can have the final word,"" Biden stressed. ""This is not over.""

The ruling came in the court's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which centered on a Mississippi law that banned abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Republican-led state of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to strike down a lower court ruling that stopped the 15-week abortion ban from taking place.

""We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the court's opinion.

Alito's opinion began with an exploration and criticism of Roe v. Wade and its holding that while states have ""a legitimate interest in protecting ‘potential life,'' this interest was not strong enough to prohibit abortions before the time of fetal viability, understood to be at about 23 weeks into pregnancy.

""The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe’s reasoning,"" Alito wrote.

Breyer, Kagan and Sotomayor dissented, writing that Roe and Casey ""understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the abortion issue,"" and by overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, a woman ""has no rights to speak of.""

""The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different views about the 'moral[ity]' of 'terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage,'"" they wrote. ""And the Court recognized that 'the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting' the 'life of the fetus that may become a child.'""

""So the Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete,"" they wrote. ""It held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman’s life or health.""

""Today, the Court discards that balance,"" they wrote. ""It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.""

""With sorrow--for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection--we dissent,"" they wrote.

President Biden continues to attempt to make the public believe his actions toward Ukraine will be substantially helpful toward the outcome in its conflict with Russia, but that might not be completely true, retired Col. Douglas Macgregor told Fox News on Thursday.

Macgregor, who served in the Gulf War, predicted on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that despite $1 billion in weapons and other aid being to Ukraine paid for by American tax dollars, that will not be enough to turn the tide.

He analyzed the battlefield and told host Tucker Carlson the military fighting going on in the eastern Donbas region and stretching along the seacoast is the ""final annihilation of what remains of Ukraine's best forces"" in that area.

Macgregor also surmised that Biden believes his actions will lead to a settlement with the Kremlin.

""I really think the president and his supporting advisers believe that somehow or another, they're going to arrive at a negotiating table in the future where they will be able to dictate terms to Moscow,"" he said.

""And that's not going to happen.""

If the Russians do not eventually seek detente, Macgregor predicted Western Ukraine will ""just become a firing range.""

Putin's troops have shown that their chief interests lie in the eastern half of Ukraine, Macgregor said.

976,Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade in landmark abortion decision,Ronn Blitzer,"

The Supreme Court on Friday overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively ending recognition of a constitutional right to abortion and giving individual states the power to allow, limit, or ban the practice altogether.

The ruling came in the court's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which centered on a Mississippi law that banned abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Republican-led state of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to strike down a lower court ruling that stopped the 15-week abortion ban from taking place.

""We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the court's opinion.

Alito's opinion began with an exploration and criticism of Roe v. Wade and its holding that while states have ""a legitimate interest in protecting ‘potential life,'' this interest was not strong enough to prohibit abortions before the time of fetal viability, understood to be at about 23 weeks into pregnancy.

LIVE UPDATES: SUPREME COURT ROE V. WADE DECISION

""The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe’s reasoning,"" Alito wrote.

Chief Justice John Roberts agreed that the viability line ""never made any sense,"" but said he would have taken ""a more measured course"" with this case. Rather than overturn Roe v. Wade altogether, Roberts said he would have continued to recognize a right to get an abortion, and that the right should ""extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further.""

The court's majority took a firmer stance against Roe v. Wade and the subsequent case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, holding ""that Roe and Casey must be overruled."" They countered the Roberts concurrence by claiming that such an approach ""would only put off the day when we would be forced to confront the question we now decide.""

The court described how the Roe opinion did not specifically explain where the right to abortion came from, rather it provided several areas of the Constitution that might provide such a right. Alito wrote that the Casey decision ""did not defend this unfocused analysis,"" instead grounding the right in the ""liberty"" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

MORE THAN 2 DOZEN STATES TO RESTRICT ABORTIONS AFTER ROE V. WADE OVERTURNED

The court's opinion recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause has been found to guarantee certain rights that are not spelled out in the Constitution, but that those rights are ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."" Abortion, the court said, ""does not fall within this category,"" as ""such a right was entirely unknown in American law"" until the late 20th century.

The earliest sources for a right to an abortion, the Court said, are ""a few"" state and district court decisions from ""shortly before Roe,"" and ""a small number of law review articles from the same time period.""

Alito referenced the dissenting opinion from Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor, stating that it ""is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a ‘deeply rooted’ one, ‘in this Nation’s history and tradition.’""

""The dissent's failure to engage with this long tradition is devastative to its position,"" Alito wrote.

The majority opinion also noted that the dissent did not provide any ""serious discussion"" of the states' interest in protecting the life of a fetus, while also making clear that the Court's ruling ""is not based on any view about if and when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth.""

The court then addressed the concept of stare decisis – the tradition of following established court precedent.

""Overruling a precedent is a serious matter,"" Alito wrote. ""It is not a step that should be taken lightly.""

Still, he said, if the Supreme Court never overturned precedent, ""American constitutional law as we know it would be unrecognizable, and this would be a different country.""

The Court then asserted that there are five reasons why Roe and Casey should be overruled: ""the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the ‘workability’ of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance.""

The Court explained that Casey's test of whether a law places an ""undue burden"" on the ability to get an abortion ""has scored poorly on the workability scale,"" citing the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who said that the test is ""inherently standardless.""

The majority criticized Casey for its vagueness and ambiguity, and its failure to give a ""clear answer"" as to how to apply its undue burden test.

The opinion went on to explain that Roe and Casey disrupted other areas of law, claiming that they ""have diluted the strict standard for facial constitutional challenges,"" ignored key judicial principles, and ""distorted First Amendment doctrines.""

MORE THAN 2 DOZEN STATES TO RESTRICT ABORTION AFTER ROE V WADE OVERTURNED IN DOBBS DECISION

Addressing the issue of reliance, the Court stated that such an interest typically arises ""where advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity."" Alito wrote that Casey itself ""conceded that those traditional reliance interests were not implicated because getting an abortion is generally ‘unplanned activity.""

As for Casey's claim that people have made decisions about their relationships in reliance on abortion being an available option, the Court said that this is not concrete enough, and that ""this Court is ill-equipped to assess ‘generalized assertions about the national psyche.’""

Alito then addressed the argument made in Casey that ""[t]he American people’s belief in the rule of law would be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an institution that decides important cases based on principle, not ‘social and political pressures.’""

While he recognized that there is indeed ""a special danger"" that the public will view a decision this way, Alito countered that ""we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public’s reaction to our work.""

ABORTION RIGHTS TO EXPAND IN BLUE STATES AFTER ROE V. WADE OVERTURNED

Public reaction to a possible overruling of Roe well before the Court handed down Friday's decision. A leak of a draft opinion by Alito from February that reached the same conclusion caused nationwide debate and promoted pro-choice activist protests at the homes of the six conservative justices.

In addition, dozens of pro-life pregnancy centers were vandalized since the opinion leak, Catholic churches were targeted for protests and unrest, and a suspect was charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Despite this, Alito wrote that the response to the Court's ruling was unknown at the time the case was decided, nor would it matter.

""We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision,"" he wrote. ""We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.""

As for any future constitutional challenges to abortion restrictions, the Court said those laws should generally be valid as long as they have a rational basis.

The dissent accused the majority of ignoring a woman's interest in making decisions about child bearing for herself.

""It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs,"" Breyer, Kagan and Sotomayor said.

""Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child,"" they added.

The dissent also claimed that the court's ruling jeopardizes other rights, such as the rights to contraception and same-sex marriage.

""They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over the most personal of life decisions,"" the dissenting justices said.

PENCE SAYS THE 'SANCTITY OF LIFE' WILL SPARK ‘RENEWED ENTHUSIASM’ FOR REPUBLICANS IN MIDTERMS

A number of Republican-led states have already passed ""trigger laws,"" in the event Roe was overturned, that would immediately restrict access to abortion.

Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina all have laws banning abortions after the six-week mark, which have been ruled unconstitutional but would likely be revisited if Roe is overturned, the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion research group, has reported.

On the other hand, pro-choice advocates will have to work to codify Roe or enact looser abortion restrictions by passing state-level legislation.

New York passed a bill in 2018 designed to codify Roe, and other blue states are expected to follow suit after the Supreme Court's ruling.

Public opinion polling has also indicated that despite that more than six in 10 registered voters think the court should uphold Roe, the majority of Americans are in favor of some restrictions on abortion.

When Americans were asked in a recent Fox News poll about how they would feel if a law banning abortions after 15 weeks were passed in their state, just over half of voters favor it (54%) while 41% are opposed.

At the federal level, the Senate failed to advance a bill to codify federal abortion protections in Roe v. Wade in the week following the leaked draft.

LT. COL. DANIEL DAVIS: I don't even think it's a long shot. I think when you look at the military fundamentals, just what has historically always been the difference between winning and losing, and when you look at the balance of power, especially the forces on the ground, they are overwhelmingly in favor of Russia. There is no rational basis upon which to hope that the war can turn around because Russia is methodically moving through and destroying the Ukrainian armed forces in the Donbas, more than capturing territory, they're destroying their ability to defend the country anywhere else. And even the sum total of all of the weapons that we have pledged, much less has shown up — it's barely a 10th of what would be the minimum necessary. And when you look at those two things right there alone, there is no rational path to a victory for Ukraine.

And therefore, even the path that we want to harm Russia is a temporary one, a short-term one, but it comes at a profound cost, like you say, to the Ukrainian people in their country, in their livelihood and in their armed forces.

979,North Carolina pregnancy center defiant after pro-abortion vandalism: 'Spiritual warfare',Jon Brown,"

A Christian faith-based pregnancy center in North Carolina recently vandalized by a radical pro-abortion group asserted that their organization is ""not going to live in fear"" amid ongoing threats.

""We don't force [pregnant women] into any choice or decision,"" said Kristi Brown, the executive director of Mountain Area Pregnancy Services (MAPS) in Asheville, North Carolina. ""So for us to be attacked because we're viewed as limiting choice, they don't even understand what we do in this building. That's the crazy part about this.""

MAPS was among the several crisis pregnancy centers nationwide damaged earlier this month in acts of arson or vandalism, later claimed by the radical pro-abortion group dubbed Jane's Revenge. The group has declared ""open season"" on such pro-life establishments since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization draft opinion leaked, which suggested the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Police, at the time, said they found broken windows and red paint splattered along the side of the building in West Asheville. Along with an anarchist symbol, graffiti demanded ""no forced births"" and warned, ""If abortions aren't safe, neither are you!"" The message was scrawled in red on the side of the building and the sidewalk in front of it.

PRO-LIFERS TARGETED OVER 40 TIMES IN ATTACKS, VANDALISM, HARASSMENT SINCE SUPREME COURT LEAK, GROUP SAYS

Police also said a forensic team found blood on one of the broken windows, suggesting the vandal may have been injured.

""It was disheartening to drive on property the day it happened and see the vandalism,"" Brown said, noting how the destruction was ""visually alarming for sure.""

""But we're not living in fear,"" she continued. ""We're continuing to serve clients and to do what we do best. We're being smart, for sure. We're aware of our surroundings, that's why we have this extra security on site right now. So we're being smart about future steps, but we're not going to live in fear because of this.""

PELOSI PRESSED ON WHETHER DEM RHETORIC FUELING VIOLENCE AGAINST CHURCHES, PRO-LIFE CLINICS

Brown explained how her organization remains unsure whether those who vandalized their property were locals or from out of town. Still, she noted how in their June 14 statement claiming responsibility, Jane's Revenge indicated they have groups all over.

""You have seen that we are real, and that we are not merely pushing empty words. As we said: we are not one group but many,"" Jane's Revenge wrote in the letter, which was first disseminated to email subscribers as an ""Abolition Media"" blog post. The group has also called for a ""Night of Rage"" beginning at 8 p.m. on whatever date the Dobbs decision is handed down.

The group appealed to anyone ""with the urge to paint, to burn, to cut, to jam"" to commit violence.

Explaining how MAPS is ""a Christ-centered 501(c)(3) nonprofit"" based on biblical principles, Brown said she and her organization see the increasing vandalism of pro-life establishments as ""truly spiritual warfare.""

ACTIVIST GROUP THREATENS TO ‘BURN EUCHARIST’ IN DISPLAY OF ‘DISGUST’ TOWARD CATHOLICS: ‘BIGOTRY’

""I have defined what happened to our building as pure evil, that's how I define that,"" she said. ""And it's definitely spiritual warfare. Because the irony in this is the pregnancy centers are being attacked because we're viewed as anti-choice, anti-abortion. And yes, we are life-affirming and don't refer for abortion, but every woman that sees us and that we serve has total choice as to what she wants to do.""

LETTER SIGNED BY RADICAL ABORTION GROUP JANE'S REVENGE DECLARES ‘OPEN SEASON’ ON PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS

As the pending Supreme Court decision looms, Brown's organization is taking extra steps to prevent another attack on its facilities. The group has undergone two security assessments in the past week to determine what they are doing well and how they can improve. She said their existing camera and alarm system might need an overhaul, and they are also taking measures to make it harder to break their windows.

They are also taking steps to shore up their cybersecurity and have considered hiring private security. However, off-duty officers from the Asheville Police Department (APD) have been patrolling their property lately. A spokesperson for APD told Fox News Digital that their investigation into the incident remains active, but that they had no updates.

""I told someone last week, I do not think any pregnancy center in America right now is safe,"" Brown said. ""You never think it's going to happen to you and, you know, it happened to us. I think the longer we wait on the Supreme Court ruling, I think that does not help the situation because everybody's anxious as to how they are going to rule.""

""We hope and pray that we're not further attacked in any capacity,"" she added.

Barstad said the motive of the shooting was not immediately evident and it was unclear whether the shooting had any connection to the Pride Parade, according to The Guardian.

""Police are in contact with the organizers of the Pride event this Saturday,"" Barstad said, according to The Guardian. ""There will be a continuous assessment of what measures police should take to protect that event and whether this incident has a connection to Pride at all.""

Leader of the largest police department in the country, Sewell said that the case has been remanded to the lower court, so ""it’s important to know today that nothing changes.""

""If you have a premise permit, it does not automatically convert to a carry permit,"" she said. ""If you carry a gun illegally in New York City, you will be arrested. Nothing changes today.""

""When we open the universe of carry permits, it potentially brings more guns to the city of New York, to the streets of New York City, and that should concern us all,"" Sewell added.

NY BAIL REFORM SECURES RELEASE OF SERIAL SHOPLIFTER WITH 122 ARRESTS WHO DA BRAGG WANTED JAILED: REPORT

Despite the Supreme Court ruling applying to private citizens applying for concealed carry permits because they want to protect themselves, Adams earlier in the press conference said the decision has and will continue to keep him up at night and ""will put New Yorkers at further risk of gun violence.""

The mayor also claimed in a statement that such a ruling could allow New York to become ""the Wild West.""

New York has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, and despite this, has seen surging crime ushered in since the height of the defund police movement. Republicans have blamed surging crime on lax prosecution by liberal district attorneys and the state’s controversial cashless bail law.

Earlier this year, when two NYPD officers were shot and killed while responding to a domestic incident, Adams met with President Biden and launched initiatives to tackle the illegal trafficking of guns.

""We have been preparing for this decision and will continue to do everything possible to work with our federal, state, and local partners to protect our city. Those efforts will include a comprehensive review of our approach to defining ‘sensitive locations’ where carrying a gun is banned, and reviewing our application process to ensure that only those who are fully qualified can obtain a carry license,"" Adams said in a statement Thursday. ""We will work together to mitigate the risks this decision will create once it is implemented, as we cannot allow New York to become the Wild West.""

""One thing is certain: We will do whatever is in our power, using every resource available to ensure that the gains we’ve seen during this administration are not undone, to make certain New Yorkers are not put in further danger of gun violence,"" Adams added. ""This decision may have opened an additional river feeding the sea of gun violence, but we will do everything we can to dam it.""

Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has defended her state's controversial bail reform law that critics claim allow violent repeat offenders back onto the streets, was defiant in her reaction to the Supreme Court ruling on concealed carry permits, vowing ""We're just getting started"" on gun restrictions.""

The case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, was the first major Second Amendment case to come before the Supreme Court in more than a decade. New York's law required a person to show ""proper cause"" before being able to obtain a concealed carry license. The ""proper cause"" standard allowed state officials to determine whether applicants had supplied a specific reason for needing a firearm, denying access to people who stated they simply wanted to protect themselves.

""In this case, petitioners and respondents agree that ordinary, law-abiding citizens have a similar right to carry handguns publicly for their self-defense.

Ricci Tres, who also goes by Ricci And Tres, took the top title in the women's division of The Boardr Open , taking home $500.

In second place was Shiloh Catori, a 13-year-old girl who is 133 in the Boardr Global Ranks, which are based on performance in skateboarding competitions. Tres, by comparison, sits at 838 in the rankings.

Four of the six competitors in the tournament were under age 17, and the youngest was Juri Iikura, who is only 10 years old, came in fifth place.

TITLE IX'S 50th ANNIVERSARY: DEBATE OVER TRANSGENDER ATHLETES

Many on social media excoriated the tournament for the biological and age disparities between the competitors, including female skateboarder Taylor Silverman, who spoke out in May after having repeatedly placed second in skateboarding contests against biological males.

""I have been in three different contests with trans women, two of which I placed second,"" Silverman wrote in an Instagram post on May 17, which met with a barrage of negative comments. She went on to explain that the transgender competitor she lost against in a Redbull Cornerstone skate event took home $1,000 in qualifiers, $3,000 in finals and $1,000 in best trick.

""This totaled $5,000 of the prize money meant for female athletes,"" Silverman noted.

Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., questioned from her personal Twitter account why 28- and 29-year-olds were ""competing against children.""

Broadcaster Tim Pool wrote that biological males have a physical advantage in skateboarding because they ""have higher centers of gravity granting advantages that cannot be removed with [hormone replacement therapy].""

The Boardr did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

The skateboarding competition comes amid a national debate over whether biological men have a competitive advantage over biological women.

On the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the Biden administration has indicated that it wants transgender athletes to enjoy the same protections that Title IX originally afforded women when it passed half a century ago.

984,Oklahoma Democrat floats mandatory vasectomies in 'tongue-in-cheek' abortion response,Timothy Nerozzi,"

An Oklahoma state representative put forward a piece of ""tongue-in-cheek"" legislation in response to state Republicans' ban on abortion.

State Rep. Mickey Dollens introduced a bill mandating vasectomies for every male that reaches puberty in Oklahoma. The bill was meant as a farcical argument against the abortion ban, attempting to draw connections between abortion and the male fertility operation.

""[The abortion ban] allows people to sue doctors for performing an abortion and defines life at the moment of 'fertilization.' Here’s an idea: mandatory vasectomies - if signed into law would be the first Oklahoma statute to control the male reproductive system,"" Dollens said of the bill.

""No more unwanted pregnancies,"" he added.

986,School districts pricing out parents on record requests by charging tens of thousands in 'exorbitant fees',Hannah Grossman,"

Parents around the United States are being charged tens of thousands of dollars, including some fees into the millions, for public records requests in their school districts, Fox News Digital has learned.

Fox News Digital spoke with parents around the county – such as in Michigan, Oregon, and Rhode Island — as well as with public records experts who said they believed schools were using exorbitant fees in order to price parents out of the information they are legally entitled to, such as those related to curriculum.

A parent from Frederick County Public Schools in Maryland told Fox News Digital that she requested emails that spanned one month between various entities and was asked to pay $5,000. ""I never got the [records] because that's well beyond what I'm willing to pay for information my tax dollars already paid for,"" she said. FCPS was contacted for comment but did not immediately respond.

In Oregon, the Oregon Department of Education slapped on $10 per email review in various requests. For example, to review 963 emails, the fee was $9,630; for 382 emails, the fee was $3,820; and 109 emails would cost $1,090, according to a complaint with the attorney general that was reviewed by Fox News Digital. The total fees subject to the complaint were ultimately reduced from nearly 15K to a few hundred bucks.

NORTH KOREAN DEFECTOR: I AM TERRIFIED OF THE 'MASSIVE INDOCTRINATION COMING FROM THE LEFT' IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Another request a parent sent into ODE came back with a fee of $1,525. ""You may narrow the scope of your request to reduce your overall cost estimate,"" a rules coordinator at ODE said, according to an email reviewed by Fox News Digital.

""How could I narrow my request? Is this not a single document?… I do not understand what you mean by narrowing or how 1 document costs $1,525 to download and email to me. Or why 3 hours of time is needed by IT to again download 1 document and email it. Please explain,"" the parent asked. Fox News Digital reached out to ODE for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

In Rochester, Michigan, the district reportedly charged fees as high as $18 million to complete their requests. ""I don’t know what they’re hiding, but they’re definitely hiding information. Why make it so difficult for parents to get [public records] if they don’t have something to hide,"" a parent told local media.

Another parent in the district said she had a public records fee of $172,951.67.

""There are some parents who have in the millions and most parents are afraid to speak out,"" parent Laurie Madigan said.

""FOIA allows the District to charge certain fees incurred for processing and responding to FOIA requests when a failure to charge a fee would result in unreasonably high costs to the District because of the nature of the request,"" the school district told Fox News Digital in a statement. Examples they provided included voluminous requests, requests that require time-consuming searches, and significant redaction.

The parents' fears of sharing their fee stubs with the media are due to stories of school districts acting against parents. One district was accused of spying and creating a list tracking over 200 parents; Rochester School District ultimately paid 190K in a settlement agreement with a parent in March who alleged her employer was contacted by someone in the district, causing her to lose her job. The parent had been advocating on social media in support of kids returning to in-person learning.

Rochester's counsel denied any wrongdoing, that they engaged in retaliation as well as the existence of the list. ""Rochester Community Schools does not have a dossier. The notion of a dossier appears to have been conceived by an attorney for litigation purposes. Rochester Community Schools does not have a list of names of parents who are on social media,"" the district previously said.

""I didn't know that anyone was monitoring anything until I was called into the HR office,"" the parent, Elena Dinverno, said. A deputy superintendent, Debra Fragomeni, contacted her employer to let them know she was participating in a Facebook group that had ""threatening behavior,"" local media reported. Fox News Digital reached out to Fragomeni but did not immediately receive a response.

""The fact that they were doing it in secret, the fact that they were compiling dossiers of parents… was shocking to me,"" the parent said.

""How dare you? How dare you track me,"" a parent named Stephanie Van Deal said in a school board meeting.

In a statement to Fox News Digital the district said, ""Recent tragic experiences of violence in other districts, such as Uvalde, Texas, and even closer to home, demand that we pay attention to all forms of media, publications and broadcasts, including social media comments, which have been shown to contain clues that could have prevented the loss of life had they been acted upon.""

In Rhode Island, South Kingstown, a parent activist named Nicole Solas sent in requests that amounted to 74K regarding the school's curriculum for her daughter, who was in kindergarten at the time. She told Fox News Digital it was her last resort as the school refused to answer her questions.

""If public information is priced outside of affordability, and it's not really public information, it's a government secret,"" Solas said.

""I don't think [this fee] is reasonable under any circumstances,"" her attorney Jon Riches of the Goldwater Institute, said, in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""I mean, the parents have a right to know what their kids are going to learn; and that includes getting access to the curriculum, to lesson plans and anything else in the classroom. There should be no charge for [it]. There shouldn't be a formal public records process. The district should put that information up on a publicly available website so parents and their kids can make informed decisions.""

Then, Solas was slapped with a lawsuit by a teachers union, the National Education Association. ""Essentially [they were] trying to stop the public records process,"" Riches said. ""I think it was a pure intimidation tactic to tell parents that they know what's best for their kids. And if parents are going to be active and be responsible and try and get information, then, well, you know, they don't like it. And then you're going to be on their list next.""

""Being sued by a special interest group, the NEA, that has $300 million in a slush fund that's available to just bully stay-at-home moms like me was a real eye-opener to how public school really operates,"" Solas said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the NEA for comment but did not immediately receive a response. However, Bob Walsh, the union’s executive director, had previously argued that he believed Solas should get access to the school's curriculum. The lawsuit, he said, sought to prevent faculty's private information in order to ""stop the school committee from releasing anything that’s 100% protected under law"" and to ""impose a balancing test on whether individual names should be released — whether the privacy interests of individual teachers outweigh any underlying elements of the requests."" He added that Solas was named in the suit because the ""law requires all interested parties to be named in the complaint.""

""This case has nothing to do with Nicole Solas,"" Walsh said.

In December, a Florida dad who has a son with autism sued the Hillsborough County Public Schools superintendent, Addison Davis, after he was quoted a fee of $8,020 for a request he made on mask mandates; the father believed virtual learning was discriminating against his son. Fox News Digital reached out to Davis but did not immediately receive a response.

""I’m just some random Black guy in Tampa,"" Blake Warner said. ""If I could realize all these harms to kids, I’m sure school board members and administrators could as well.""

The district released a statement to Fox News Digital, which said, ""The public records request in question was very broad and produced 70,000 pages of documents including emails over a two-year time span. Many public records, including emails, contain information that may need redaction for privacy reasons. Because this would utilize extensive use of technology and clerical resources, the requestor would be charged by the hour for the work required to pull, redact, and produce the information.""

The statement continued, ""As always, a requestor can lessen the scope of a request to produce fewer pages that will result in no charge. The requestor in this case was not charged $8,000. He was given an estimate on how long it would take to produce and redact 70,000 pages of documents. He decided not to pay for the time it would take to produce the information.""

Additionally, journalists are also being charged exorbitant fees for requests. In Iowa, a journalist named Jacob Hall requested records relating to ""Transgender Week"" at Linn-Mar High School; it would cost $604,000 for the records. Fox News Digital reached out to the principal for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Randy Evans, who is the executive director of the Iowa Freedom of Information Council, told Fox News Digital that the 604K was the highest he has seen thus far. However, he routinely sees fees in the thousands, which he believes is too high. ""The reality is that for most ordinary folks in Iowa having to write a check for a $1,000 or $1,200 dollars to get records about what is occurring in their school district seems exorbitant to me.""

Districts counter-argue that the ballooning requests they are sent cause them to hire more people and to pay thousands to respond with the information. Depending on the nature of the request, schools may need to meticulously redact, or they opt to send the records to an attorney for review.

For example, New Hanover County Schools in North Carolina decided last year to begin charging fees due to the voluminous requests sent their way. In one example, a request they received pulled up 400,000 emails, which they estimated would cost $100,000 to print.

And in Minnesota, a law firm called Equality in Education filed a request at the Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan district that spanned 41 pages, which was estimated to cost $900K to fulfill. According to the superintendent, Kent Pekel, it would take 13,000 hours to produce all the records. A local paper strongly criticized the request. They said, ""We wish them good luck as they peruse the tens of thousands of pages of documents in their search for a third-grade teacher’s text message that uses the words ‘race’ and ‘critical’ in the same sentence.""

However, the public records expert from Iowa counters that while he agrees there ""is a cost associated with public records,"" schools should be looking for ways to keep the fees down. Evans said that schools should pay lawyers to issue a memorandum to train staff on what they legally need to redact and withhold, in order to – for example – avoid violating students' privacy – or the Family Rights and Protection Act (FERPA).

""I just don't believe that the only way that you can guard against violating the FERPA statute is by having a lawyer half a state away reviewing every email that is up for consideration to be released,"" Evans said.

""I think that government is using the cost as a way to place records out of reach of ordinary folks,"" he continued.

And in addition to the alleged tactic to use exorbitant fees to restrict public access, sometimes schools deny they have records that parents may strongly believe exist.

For example, Carol Beth Litkouhi heard that a public high school in Rochester was teaching ""Ethnic and Gender Studies."" When Litkouhi asked the school for the records, they gave her a lesson plan and informed her if she wanted more she would need to send public records requests.

The mom sent requests for months but received denials that the records she was requesting did not exist, she told Fox News Digital.

""They've been avoiding sending responses to other parents, too, but they use other kinds of tactics, like they were charging people these exorbitant fees for information,"" she said.

Litkouhi sued the district about the matter.

""In fact, before the lawsuit was filed, Rochester Community Schools had provided or made available the requested materials which were knowingly in its possession,"" the district told Fox News in a statement. ""An invitation was also extended to allow the requesting party an opportunity to arrange an in-person review of any copyrighted works responsive to the FOIA request, consistent with our obligations to the copyright holders under applicable law. The requesting party has not scheduled a time to review the copyrighted materials.""

Carol Beth rebutted this claim, saying that it was ""factually incorrect and misleading.""

""In the FOIA response for the Ethnic and Gender Studies class, the district claimed no public records exist, apart from one lesson plan for the first two weeks of school. Accordingly, the district did not extend an invitation to review any records related to this particular FOIA request,"" she said.

As for what parents should know about these requests, her attorney, Steve Delie of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, said, ""Every state has a freedom of information law and parents… should remember these are public records – these are all of our records. And we should be able to access them. And if they find barriers to that, they should look for legal representation that can help them out.""

988,High school football coach scores big win at Supreme Court over post-game prayer,Ronn Blitzer,"

The Supreme Court handed a big win to a former Washington high school football coach who lost his job over reciting a prayer on the 50-yard line after games.

At issue was whether a public school employee praying alone but in view of students was engaging in unprotected ""government speech,"" and if it is not government speech, does it still pose a problem under the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.

The Supreme Court ruled Monday in a 6-3 decision that the answer to both questions is no.

""Here, a government entity sought to punish an individual for engaging in a brief, quiet, personal religious observance doubly protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. And the only meaningful justification the government offered for its reprisal rested on a mistaken view that it had a duty to ferret out and suppress,"" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the Court's opinion. ""Religious observances even as it allows comparable secular speech. The Constitution neither mandates nor tolerates that kind of discrimination.""

CONSERVATIVE SCOTUS JUSTICES OFFER TACIT SUPPORT FOR FOOTBALL COACH's ON-FIELD PRAYER

Joe Kennedy was a junior varsity head coach and varsity assistant coach with the Bremerton School District in Washington from 2008 to 2015. He began the practice of reciting a post-game prayer by himself, but eventually students started joining him. According to court documents, this evolved into motivational speeches that included religious themes. After an opposing coach brought it to the principal's attention, the school district told Kennedy to stop. He did, temporarily, then notified the school that he would resume the practice.

The situation garnered media attention, and when Kennedy announced that he would go back to praying on the field, it raised security concerns. When he did pray after the game, a number of people stormed the field in support.

The school district then offered to let Kennedy pray in other locations before and after games, or for him to pray on the 50-yard line after everyone else had left the premises, but he refused, insisting that he would continue his regular practice. After continuing the prayers at two more games, the school district placed Kennedy on leave.

WASHINGTON FOOTBALL COACH WOULD RETURN TO FIELD ‘IN A HEARTBEAT’ IF HE WINS SCOTUS PRAYER CASE

The school district's reasoning was that if they allowed Kennedy, their employee, to pray on the field at a school game, it would violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which protects separation of church and state.

""That reasoning was misguided,"" the majority opinion said. ""Both the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment protect expressions like Mr. Kennedy’s. Nor does a proper understanding of the Amendment’s Establishment Clause require the government to single out private religious speech for special disfavor. ""

Gorsuch stated that not just the Constitution, but ""the best of our traditions"" call for ""mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike.""

The Court's ruling also stated that there is a distinct reason for why speech like Kennedy's is protected by both the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses.

""That the First Amendment doubly protects religious speech is no accident. It is a natural outgrowth of the framers’ distrust of government attempts to regulate religion and suppress dissent,"" Gorsuch wrote.

The Court explained why Kennedy's prayer is not government speech, even though he was a government employee. The opinion stated that his words were not ""pursuant to a government policy,"" he was not ""seeking to convey a government-created message,"" and he was not acting in the normal scope of his duties because the game was over, he was not providing instruction or game strategy, and that he prayed at a time when he was free to do other things like ""attend briefly to personal matters.""

Justice Samuel Alito also recognized in an concurring opinion that Kennedy prayed ""while at work but during a time when a brief lull in his duties apparently gave him a few free moments to engage in private activities.""

The Court's majority opinion noted that Kennedy had ""voluntarily discontinued the school tradition of locker-room prayers and his postgame religious talks to students,"" and that the school district only took action against him ""only for his decision to persist in praying quietly without his players after three games in October 2015.""

At the District’s request, he voluntarily discontinued the school tradition of locker-room prayers and his postgame religious talks to students. The District disciplined him only for his decision to persist in praying quietly without his players after three games in October 2015.""

A dissenting opinion from Justice Sonio Sotomayor, who was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, claimed that the majority's opinion ""misconstrues the facts"" of the case.

""The record reveals that Kennedy had a longstanding practice of conducting demonstrative prayers on the 50-yard line of the football field,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""Kennedy consistently invited others to join his prayers and for years led student athletes in prayer at the same time and location. The Court ignores this history.""

Sotomayor also pointed to claims that players had felt pressured to join Kennedy out of a desire to win favor and playing time. During oral arguments, Kennedy's attorney addressed the assertion that Kennedy' prayer had a coercive effect, noting that the school district did not bring it up as a reason for ending his employment.",https://www.foxnews.com
989,More than 1 million voters switch registration to GOP as suburbs break from Biden,Anders Hagstrom,"

More than one million U.S. voters have switched their party affiliation to the GOP over the past 12 months, painting a grim picture for Democrats in the 2022 midterms.

The GOP is benefiting most in the suburbs of large and medium cities, where voters who supported President Joe Biden in 2020 are struggling with inflation and growing increasingly critical of Democratic social issues, according to an analysis from The Associated Press.

Roughly 1.7 million Americans have changed their party affiliation over the past 12 months. Two-thirds of those have gone to the GOP, while just 630,000 have switched to the Democratic Party, according to the report.

While not the final nail in the coffin for Democrats, the voter trend is yet another indicator that Republicans stand to make large gains in Congress and state governments across the country in November.

Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel attributed the big gains for her party to ""Biden’s gas hike, the open border crisis, baby formula shortage and rising crime.""

""Biden and Democrats are woefully out of touch with the American people, and that’s why voters are flocking to the Republican Party in droves,"" McDaniel told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""American suburbs will trend red for cycles to come.""

992,NY Supreme Court strikes down law allowing noncitizens to vote,Ronn Blitzer,"

The New York Supreme Court ruled Monday that a New York City law that allowed noncitizen residents to vote in municipal elections is illegal.

The law, passed in December 2021 by the New York City Council, created a class of voters called ""municipal voters,"" comprised of noncitizens who reside in the city for at least 30 days before an election and register or pre-register to vote. Under the law, municipal voters were granted the right to participate in elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, and council member.

""The New York State Constitution explicitly lays the foundation for ascertaining that only proper citizens retain the right to voter privileges,"" Richmond County Supreme Court Judge Ralph Porzio said in the court's ruling. ""It is this Court's belief that by not expressly including non-citizens in the New York State Constitution, it was the intent of the framers for non-citizens to be omitted.""

The bill first became law automatically after former Mayor Bill de Blasio and current Mayor Eric Adams both declined to either sign or veto it. De Blasio had openly expressed concerns about it, recognizing that there were ""big legal questions"" surrounding it. He had also stated that he was worried the noncitizen residents of the city – estimated to be somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million people – would have less incentive to become citizens.

WHERE ARE NONCITIZENS ALLOWED TO VOTE IN THE US?

The Republican National Committee and New York Republican State Committee joined a group of officeholders and individual voters who sued city officials over the law, arguing that it violates the New York State Constitution, state election law, and the Municipal Home Rule Law. They also claimed that their votes would be diluted by allowing noncitizens to vote.

Upon examining Articles II and IX of the State Constitution, Judge Porzio added that ""it is clear to this Court that voting is a right granted to citizens of the United States,"" and thus the city law granting the right to noncitizens violates the constitution.

Porzio also cited New York Election Law section 5-102(1), which states: ""No person shall be qualified to register for and vote at any election unless he is a citizen of the United States."" He also found the city law to be in violation of the Municipal Home Rule Law, which states that local governments can adopt their own laws so far as they are ""not inconsistent with"" the state constitution or other laws ""relating to its property, affairs of government[.]""

""There is no statutory ability for the City of New York to issue inconsistent laws permitting non-citizens to vote and exceed the authority granted to it by the New York State Constitution,"" Porzio concluded, granting a declaratory judgment stating that the city law is void, as well as an injunction prohibiting city officials from registering noncitizens to vote.

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, shock jock Howard Stern said it may be time for him to run for president and revealed several things on his political checklist.

""I’m actually going to probably have to run for president now,"" the SiriusXM host said Monday on the ""Howard Stern Show.""

Should he run for office, Stern said he would put an end to the Electoral College, a longtime subject of angst for liberals. However, as president he could not unilaterally do this.

""I am going to do the very simple thing that’ll set the country straight: one vote, one person,"" Stern said.

HOWARD STERN DISTRAUGHT OVER END OF MASK MANDATES, BLAMES REPUBLICANS: 'THE WACKOS ARE WINNING'

Stern’s radical aim to disband the U.S. electoral system was spurred by his claim that Donald Trump lost the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.

""A guy who lost the vote won the election,"" Stern said. ""How long can we keep electing people who lost the election?""

At one point in the show, Stern claimed that the issue facing most presidents is that their agenda is too big. But Stern’s agenda is much smaller in scope, although vague.

""The only agenda I would have is to make the country fair again,"" he announced, before segueing into criticism of the conservative Supreme Court justices.

Stern first singled out Clarence Thomas, who he described as a ""dormant Darth Vader"" waiting around for ""other kooks"" to join the Court. He also said that overturning Roe v. Wade was ""horrible,"" citing women who find out their child has birth defects, women who are raped and the questionable quality of some forms of contraception.

""The other thing is, if I do run for president, and I’m not f-----g around, I’m really thinking about it — because the only other thing I’m going to do is appoint five more Supreme Court justices,"" Stern said.

His words marked his first public comments on abortion since the Supreme Court’s decision was handed down.

Should he run for president, it would not be the first time Stern has thrown his hat in the political ring.

995,School Apologizes After Students Pray to Allah on Field Trip to Mosque,Todd Starnes,"

A Massachusetts school district has apologized to parents after a group of schoolchildren participated in midday Muslim prayers during a field trip to a Boston-area mosque.

The incident occurred in May when a social studies class from Wellesley Middle School toured the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, one of the largest mosques in the Northeast.

Parents were told their children would be learning about the architecture of a mosque and they would be allowed to observe a prayer service. But the students wound up being given a lecture on the Prophet Muhammad, and some boys participated in a midday prayer service.

The field trip was videotaped by a parent whose child was on the trip. At one point, the video shows a spokeswoman for the mosque telling students, “You have to believe in Allah, and Allah is the one God, the only one worthy of worship, all forgiving, all merciful.""

Attorney Rob Meltzer represents the parent, who asked not to be identified. He’s launched an investigation into the incident and says he may consider filing a lawsuit or complaint against the school district.

“Personally, I was appalled,” Meltzer told FOX News Radio. “We are obviously very concerned about how much control parents were given and the lack of informed consent.”

The sixth graders were also reportedly told that jihad is a personal spiritual struggle that has nothing to do with holy war, and girls on the field trip were told that Islam is pro-women.

“Islam was actually very advanced in terms of recognizing women’s rights,” an unidentified mosque spokeswoman says in the video. “At the time of the Prophet Muhammad, women were allowed to express their opinions and vote. In this country, women didn’t gain that right until less than a hundred years ago.”

Dennis Hale, a spokesman for Americans for Peace and Tolerance, which has been critical of the mosque, told Fox News Radio that the students were then instructed on how to pray during the midday service.

He said mosque officials separated the group by gender and invited male students to join traditional Muslim prayers. The video shows young boys bowing and prostrating themselves – with their heads touching the floor. At no point during the event did any school teacher or school official intervene.

But the Muslim American Society of Boston told the Boston Globe that no one asked the students to participate in the prayers.

“Certainly in our tours we do not invite kids to take part, but if someone wants to come and pray and take part, we shouldn’t prevent them,” the group's president, Bilal Kaleem, told the newspaper. “It’s more an issue with the school.”

But Hale says the mosque was engaged in proselytizing. “You can easily imagine what would have happened if a Catholic priest had taken some kids from a school to teach them about Catholicism and have them take communion without telling the parents,” he told Fox News Radio. “The furor would be visible from outer space.”

On Thursday, nearly four months after the incident, the Wellesley School District sent a letter to parents apologizing for what happened.

“I extend my sincere apologies for the error that occurred and regret the offense it may have caused,” Superintendent Bella Wong wrote in a statement provided to FOX News Radio. “In the future, teachers will provide more clear guidance to students to better define what is allowed to fulfill the purpose of observation.”

Wong explained the field trip was part of a course titled, “Enduring Beliefs and the World Today.” It included a visit to a synagogue and a mosque – along with a gospel music concert and a meeting with representatives of the Hindu religion.

She acknowledged that five students participated in the midday Muslim prayers, and she confirmed that a parent videotaped the incident.

“It was not the intent for students to be able to participate in any of the religious practices,” she wrote. “The fact that any students were allowed to do so in this case was an error.”",https://www.foxnews.com
996,'There is no God but Allah'? School accused of Islamic indoctrination,Todd Starnes,"

Maury County, Tennessee is in the heart of the Bible Belt. So it’s understandable why the local church ladies got all shook up when they discovered that school children had been forced to declare, “There is no God but Allah.”

Seventh graders at Spring Hill Middle School spent three weeks covering Islam in a Social Studies class – enraging some parents who say the lessons crossed the line into indoctrination and proselytization.

Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch – a must-read for Conservatives.

Could you imagine the outcry from liberal activists if the students had been forced to write “Jesus is Lord’?

“I am not pleased that my 12-year-old was taught the Islamic conversion prayer,” parent Brandee Porterfield told me.

Joy Ellis was a bit fired up, too. She discovered the Islamic lessons after examining her daughter’s class work.

“I was very angry that my child, my Christian child, was made to profess that Allah was the only God,” she told me.

According to the lessons, students were instructed to write the “Shahada” – “There is no God but Allah; Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.” Students also learned the five pillars of Islam.

“That was crossing the line between teaching the culture and teaching them the Islamic faith,” Porterfield told me. “This is not teaching. This is indoctrination.”

Could you imagine the outcry from liberal activists if the students had been forced to write “Jesus is Lord’?

Porterfield said she does not have a problem with the school teaching Islam – so long as they give other major religions equal time. But that did not happen.

“They told me they would not be teaching Christianity,” she said. “Because they only taught this one faith – to me that is state-sponsored prayer in schools.”

Ellis said it appears the school is advancing a pro-Muslim agenda.

“It tells me they are trying to convert my children to being Muslim,” she said.

School officials defended the lessons and disputed some of the allegations from the irate moms and dads.

“We are not trying to convert,” Dr. Jan Hanvey, the district’s middle school supervisor, told the Columbia Daily Herald.

Hanvey said the curriculum has been in place for more than 30 years. She also disputed the allegations that the Islamic religion was taught for three weeks, telling the newspaper they spent three weeks talking about the geography, culture, economics and government surrounding the religion.

So what about other religions – like Christianity? Buddism? Judaisim?

Hanvey said the chapter on Christianity was “put off” until a later date. She told the Daily Herald by the end of the school year the students will have studied other faiths.

Porterfield told me she spoke with her daughter’s teacher – and was told a very different story.

“She said they would not be covering it because Christianity is not in the school standards,” Porterfield said.

Porterfield and Ellis also took issue with the “white-washing” of the Islamic faith. There were no discussions about extremists slaughtering Christians and Jews. There were no chapters on the extremists beheading people.

“The textbook is a very cleaned up version of Islam,” Porterfield said.

Hanvey told the local newspaper that modern events have caused “fear” of Islam – going so far as to compare it to how Japanese people were treated after Pearl Harbor was bombed.

Well, Dr. Hanvey -- flying jetliners into skyscrapers in the name of Allah tends to cause folks to be a bit fearful.

I’ve been documenting the rise of Islam in American public school classrooms for a number of years. There’s a chapter dedicated to it in my last book, “God Less America.”

The Islamic faith is being accommodated while the Christian faith is being marginalized. If you need proof, just consider this:

A few weeks ago, a Mississippi high school marching band was ordered not to play “How Great Thou Art” during a half time show. And yet just a few states away public school children are learning the Islamic profession of faith.

I wonder what the Islamic term is for double-standard?

997,"Defense Department reverses rule, allows HIV-positive members to serve",Timothy Nerozzi,"

The Department of Defense published a document Wednesday announcing individuals with HIV are no longer barred from service.

The document, dated June 6, cites advances in medical technology as justification for the change in regulation.

Effective immediately, individuals who are HIV-positive but asymptomatic and with an undetectable viral load will be allowed to deploy. Additionally, individuals covered by the new policy cannot be separated from their peers or discharged due to their illness.

""In view of significant advances in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), it is necessary to update DOD policy with respect to individuals who have been identified as HIV-positive,"" the document states.

JUDGE RULES US MILITARY CANNOT DISCHARGE HIV-POSITIVE TROOPS

""Individuals who have been identified as HIV positive, are asymptomatic and who have a clinically confirmed undetectable viral load (hereinafter, 'covered personnel') will have no restrictions applied to their deployability or to their ability to commission while a service member solely on the basis of their HIV-positive status.""

HIV-positive service members will be expected to follow treatment and evaluation in line with the standard procedure for troops with chronic illnesses.

""A service member with laboratory evidence of [HIV] infection will be referred for appropriate treatment and a medical evaluation of fitness for continued service in the same manner as a service member with other chronic or progressive illnesses, including evaluation on a case-by-case basis,"" the document continues. ""Covered personnel will not be discharged or separated solely on the basis of their HIV-positive status.""

The policy change follows a pair of federal court cases in Virginia that ended with the judge ruling exclusion of HIV-positive troops as employment discrimination.

The cases involved two service members that the Air Force attempted to discharge, as well as Sgt. Nick Harrison of the D.C. Army National Guard, who was denied a position in the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps.

U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said in a written order dated April 6 that her ruling bars the military from taking those actions against the plaintiffs and any other asymptomatic HIV-positive service member with an undetectable viral load ""because they are classified as ineligible for worldwide deployment ... due to their HIV-positive status.""

The Department of Justice argued before the 4th Circuit that the Air Force determined the two airmen could no longer perform their duties because their career fields required them to deploy frequently and because their condition prevented them from deploying to the U.S. Central Command’s area of responsibility.

In its written ruling, the 4th Circuit panel said a ban on deployment may have been justified at a time when HIV treatment was less effective at managing the virus and reducing the risk of transmission.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.

Conservative actor James Woods was quick with a response Thursday after left-leaning fellow thespian Alyssa Milano decried the recent surge in gun sales in the U.S.

“Americans bought over 2 million firearms in March of 2020, over a million more than this time last year,” wrote Milano, who backs Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.

Tying the gun statistics to the coronavirus outbreak, Milano then shared her advice for how the public should deal with the crisis.

NRA FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST CALIFORNIA OVER 'TARGETING' OF GUN STORES AMID CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN

“We have to keep each other safe by social distancing and washing our hands and not bringing dangerous firearms into our homes,” she wrote, adding the hashtags, #StopTheCoronavirusGunSurge and #NoRA.

In his reply, Woods suggested some gun buyers may have very pragmatic safety reasons for planning weapons purchases.

“Thank you for the reminder,” Woods wrote to Milano in retweeting her post. “When the looting starts, always be prepared. Buy more ammo!”

Some recent news seemed to back Woods’ concerns.

With many businesses closed and Americans struggling to find items they need amid the outbreak, reports of burglaries and other crimes have been in the news.

In California, authorities in Stanislaus County said this week that 10 suspects had been charged with looting, which refers to thefts that occur during emergency situations.

Police in Modesto say a man and woman were recently seen in a store parking lot pushing a shopping cart containing about $400 in items for which they allegedly hadn’t paid, the Modesto Bee reported. The woman was arrested but the man remained at large.

In another incident, police arrested two men who allegedly broke into surrounding businesses so they could access the ATMs at a Wells Fargo Bank branch, the Bee reported.

In New York City, police say burglaries at commercial addresses have risen 75 percent since March 12, when Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Seattle has seen burglaries rise 21 percent, including an 87 percent spike in the city’s downtown area, police recently told radio station KTTH-AM.

Rising crime and rising anxiety – such as that prompted by the coronavirus pandemic -- often lead to a rise in gun sales, gun store owners and others recently told Fox News.

""Firearms are a psychological symbol of being safer in uncertain times,” Dennis Santiago, a California-based firearms instructor, and financial risk analyst, said last month. “People will gravitate to them. They are not acquiring them to use them. They are purchasing them, hoping they won't have to.”

1003,"Most illegal immigrants in US receive government benefits, costing taxpayers billions: experts",William La Jeunesse,"

This week, the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to count self-identified illegal immigrants in the 2020 census. Cities worry adding the citizenship question could undercount 6.5 million people. Their argument, however, isn't just about political power but billions of dollars in federal funds states expect.

The case underscores what experts say is a growing cost to taxpayers from the surge of Central American families and unaccompanied minors.

""We're talking about billions of dollars in taxpayer benefits over the next few years,"" said Dan Stein, director of the right-leaning think tank, Federation for American Immigration Reform. ""The payout for the taxpayer is enormous and income to the Treasury is miniscule.""

A FAIR study in 2017 found illegal immigrants are a net consumer of taxpayer benefits worth more than $100 billion a year, not including the cost of enforcing the border.

While federal benefits are supposed to be off limits, in practice many are not. More than 25,000 undocumented workers receive subsidized housing, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Children receive free education and most qualify for English lessons and free school breakfast and lunch.

NEW MEXICO COUNTY DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY OVER SURGE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CROSSING THE BORDER

Illegal immigrants do not qualify for Obamacare but under federal law, hospitals and clinics are required to provide urgent medical care without regard to legal status. Pregnant women are entitled to prenatal and postpartum care under the Women, Infants and Children program. Infant delivery costs are paid for by Medicaid. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found a federal-state immigrant insurance program cost $2 billion a year in emergency treatment, not including the $1.24 billion in infant delivery expenses.

Illegal immigrants are not entitled to food stamps, but families with U.S.-born children are. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, 31% of such families use the SNAP program and more than 50% of Central American families in the U.S. use at least one welfare program.

This is especially true of asylum seekers said Art Arthur, a former immigration judge now with the Center for Immigration Studies, an immigration think tank. Arthur said because there is a three to five year lag time between apprehension and court appearance, young asylum seekers put down roots, allowing many to access programs they are initially unaware or afraid to use.

""You're going to buy a house, get a job, have kids,"" he said. ""So their entire life changes, and that means their claim changes. Because of a lack of a bright line for immigration judges, appeals are endless and people don't leave.""

Recognizing that many illegal workers fill jobs communities need, 26 states offer them *state-funded* benefits. New York state offers up to $300 a month in cash assistance. Eleven states offer free or subsidized medical and hospital care. California offers food stamps, legal services and benefits for those over 65 or disabled. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently asked for an extra $50 million from lawmakers to serve the state's illegal immigrant population.

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: CONGRESS MUST ACT TO END THE CRISIS ON OUR BORDER

Such sanctuary states and immigrant-friendly cities are an obvious draw, but others say it is all about finding work not using benefits.

The Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2018 found Central American families may struggle financially in the U.S. but they work (76%) at high rates than native-born Americans (73%).

""At the end of the day people are going to go where their jobs are, not necessarily where the services are,"" said Ali Noorani, director of the National Immigration Forum. ""So yes, 26 states may provide state-funded access to public benefits. But if those states don't have a growing economy and don't have jobs that are open immigrants, much as anybody else, they're not going to see them.""

Up to 70% of immigrants apprehended at the border this fiscal year are families or unaccompanied minors claiming asylum. Unlike other border crossers, after six months asylum seekers qualify for work permits and most taxpayer subsidies. But because most are unskilled and uneducated, they earn minimum wage or less.

Almost half, according to the census survey, never finished high school. They earn 40% less than U.S.-born workers and about 50% of families live in poverty, requiring community support for food and cash for necessities. Some have sponsors, but most are usually immediate families that are not much better off.

""There is a cost for communities for sure,"" Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., said last week outside a Salvation Army shelter in Yuma. ""Whether it is in uncompensated care in hospitals or the education system in different ways. It has never really been measured, but it is very real.""

Advocates for illegal immigrants argue most studies are flawed because they do not account for their economic contribution to the economy as a whole. Not just because they perform jobs Americans won't, but studies don't account for their lower wage differential that produces cost savings to U.S. consumers.

""We need an immigration system that treats the American taxpayer fairly,"" Noorani said. ""Right now, our immigration system doesn't treat the American taxpayer fairly and I would argue it really treats nobody fairly. At the federal level, what the Congress and the president need to do is work together to create an immigration system that is fair to the taxpayer and 10 or 11 million people who are undocumented.""

The Intercept’s D.C. Bureau Chief Ryan Grim described what he saw as a habit in left-wing advocacy groups such as Time's Up of ""using a moment of public awakening to smuggle through standard grievances cloaked in the language of social justice.""

""In fact, it’s hard to find a Washington-based progressive organization that hasn’t been in tumult, or isn’t currently in tumult,"" Grim noted.

While noting dozens of liberal political groups have sprung up since the Trump administration, he wrote how most of them have since been buried in personal internal squabbles.

He offered story after story of progressive groups that ate their own in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the racial reckoning. Charges of systemic racism turned inward and organizations were shaken up.

At first, 2021 brought Democrats new hope, but by the summer, most of the foundation-backed organizations that make up the backbone of the party’s ideological infrastructure were still spending their time locked in virtual retreats, Slack wars, and healing sessions, grappling with tensions over hierarchy, patriarchy, race, gender, and power,"" Grim wrote.

""So much energy has been devoted to the internal strife and internal bullshit that it’s had a real impact on the ability for groups to deliver,"" said one organization leader who departed his position that Grim quoted. ""It’s been huge, particularly over the last year and a half or so, the ability for groups to focus on their mission, whether it’s reproductive justice, or jobs, or fighting climate change.""

Grim also remarked how this behavior embodies the ""caricature"" of the left that was popularized by right-wing critics.

BIDEN BEING ‘SENT OUT TO PASTURE’ AS 2022 DEMOCRATS FLEE, MEDIA CHALLENGES FLAILING PRESIDENT: WATTERS

""This is, of course, a caricature of the left: that socialists and communists spend more time in meetings and fighting with each other than changing the world. But in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential election, and then Joe Biden’s, it has become nearly all-consuming for some organizations, spreading beyond subcultures of the left and into major liberal institutions,"" Grim wrote.

Despite expressing disappointment at these meltdowns, Grim added that some work confrontations were ""long overdue"" and may help better the organizations in the long term.

""The reckoning was in many ways long overdue, forcing organizations to deal with persistent problems of inclusion, equity, and poor management,"" he wrote.

""In the long term, the organizations may become better versions of themselves while finally living the values they’ve long fought for. In the short term, the battles between staff and organizational leadership have effectively sidelined major progressive institutions at a critical moment in U.S. and world history.""

Grim concluded, ""Winning power requires working in coalition with people who, by definition, do not agree with you on everything; otherwise they’d be part of your organization and not a separate organization working with you in coalition. Winning power requires unity in the face of a greater opposition, which runs counter to a desire to live a just life in each moment.""

1006,"Israeli Prime Minister Bennett announces retirement from politics, paving the way for Netanyahu’s return",Ruth Marks Eglash,"

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced Wednesday that he was withdrawing from political life and that he would not take part in the country’s next national election, a move that could possibly ease the return of long-serving leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who was ousted from office a year ago.

Bennett’s statement to stand down, at least for now, comes just over a week after he informed the public that he could no longer hold together his fragile coalition, sending the country to the polls for the fifth time in less than four years. An election is likely to take place in late October or early November.

A poll taken by Israeli TV’s Channel 12 News immediately following Bennett’s announcement on Wednesday showed Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party gaining at least 15 seats more than its closest rival and gaining enough support from other right-wing factions and those loyal to the former leader to form a government with a small majority.

In a brief televised statement from Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, Bennett said, ""I do not intend to compete in the coming elections but will remain a loyal soldier in the service of this country.""

ISRAELI PARLIAMENT'S COALITION CHAIR RESIGNS, OPENING DOOR TO NEW ELECTIONS, BIBI NETANYAHU COMEBACK

""The state of Israel is the love of my life,"" said Bennett, who entered into office a year ago heading a broad government coalition made up of eight parties spanning the political spectrum and including for the first time an Arab-Israeli party. Ultimately, it was the clash of ideologies that brought Bennett’s coalition to an end last week.

Israel’s parliament is expected to be dissolved on Thursday and be replaced with a caretaker government led by Bennett’s coalition partner, Yair Lapid, who will run the country through what is expected to be a fraught four-month election period.

Lapid, a former journalist and media personality, stands apart from other Israeli prime ministers as he does not have a strong military background and did not graduate from high school. Unlike other Israeli prime ministers, Lapid served as a correspondent for an army magazine during his compulsory military service before becoming a newspaper reporter and eventually a regular face on Israeli TV screens, including hosting the nightly news.

However, being in the top office as Israelis head to the polls will put Lapid, who for the past year has served as Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister, in a prime position to showcase his political skills and go head-to-head with his main rival, Netanyahu.

NETANYAHU WARNS IRAN COULD ‘TAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD HOSTAGE’ IF WEST APPROVES NEW NUKE DEAL

As interim prime minister, Lapid will be the one to meet with President Joe Biden when he makes his first visit as president to Israel next month and might also be the one to work with the White House as it encourages normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which the president also intends to visit during his Middle East trip.

Biden is also expected to meet with Netanyahu, who formally heads the opposition in Israel’s parliament. The two leaders have a long but temperamental relationship. When Biden visited Israel as vice president in 2010, while Netanyahu was prime minister, an announcement of new settlements in East Jerusalem created a crisis between the two leaders.

Since 2019, Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, have struggled to form a stable coalition government because of the fragmented nature of the country’s parliamentary system, which allows a host of small parties and requires that the government controls a majority of the seats. Bennett struggled over the past three months to keep his coalition together after members of his own faction quit over ideological differences.

Pundits said that Bennett’s decision to stand out this election will most likely work in Netanyahu’s favor.

""We have already seen by the polls just published that Bennett’s withdrawal paves the way for Netanyahu,"" Aviv Bushinsky, former media advisor and chief of staff for former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Fox News Digital.

The Channel 12 poll shows Netanyahu’s Likud party receiving some 35 seats in Israel’s 120-seat parliament if elections were held today. While 35 is not enough alone to form a government, the culmination of four or five other parties that have remained loyal to Netanyahu, who served as prime minister for a combined total of 15 years, will allow him to form a coalition.

""Bennett said he was going to take time out from politics, but it's clear that he was pushed to it, and it is not something he really wants to do,"" Bushinsky added. ""He will, however, stay in his position until the government dissolves in order to prevent Netanyahu from forming a government in the current parliament.""",https://www.foxnews.com
1007,Oregon school teaches kids 'antiracist' curriculum on why 'being color blind is not the best choice',Hannah Grossman,"

EXCLUSIVE – An Oregon elementary school taught kids that they should not be ""color blind"" to the race of their peers, according to course materials.

Errol Hassell Elementary in Beaverton taught a 21-day antiracist curriculum as part of a school-wide initiative for the first days of January 2022. The curriculum instructed elementary children to describe their race, informed them about microaggressions and systemic racism.

""This challenge is for all of us, staff and students,"" the curriculum said. ""Each day, for the first 21 school days of 2022, we will gather as a school and learn about social justice together.""

Teachers were also instructed that if a child asked a question that made them feel uncomfortable, they should ""write them down"" and a staff member would come in and address them.

In discussion questions they were asked, ""Why is being color blind not the best choice?"" and ""What are some invisible ways that racism shows up in our lives?""

OREGON 'BIPOC' TEACHERS CLAIMS EYE-ROLLING IS AN EXAMPLE OF A 'HARMFUL PRACTICE ROOTED IN WHITE SUPREMACY'

On the first day, students were asked to ""Think of one or two words that describe the color of your skin"" and ""draw or paint a self-portrait.""

However, the curriculum cautioned that kids had to ""ask… permission"" and had to use ""the appropriate colors.""

""You may include another other person in your picture, but make sure to ask their permission and use the appropriate colors to show the of shade their skin,"" the curriculum said.

Another day of the challenge focused on ""defining microaggressions"" and addressed ""how to respond"" when another kid microaggresses them. The curriculum said that kids should ""talk to a grown up about it.""

""Microaggressions are defined as every day, subtle, intentional or unintentional interactions or behaviors that communicate some sort of bias toward historically marginalized groups,"" the curriculum said. ""These can be comments, interactions, body language or other behaviors that make a person or group of people feel less than another person or group.""

Examples of microaggressions, according to the curriculum, included criticizing foods from other cultures, ""commenting on someone's hair,"" comparing skin tones, and pointing out ""attire such as hijab, yamakas, hoodies and more.""

Probing into the students' identities, the curriculum asked:

""What words do you use for your race?""

When did you first learn about your race?

What does your race mean to you now?

""We pledge to be changemakers in our community by ________.""

The curriculum also suggests that children should become activists. ""How can you use your voice to bring about change? How can you be an activist?"" it said. The suggestions included making signs and marching in protest.

""Enough is Enough! We can take actions to make our community a better place by us all. Use your voice to speak up and out. Together we can Heal Our World but we have to get into good trouble,"" the curriculum said.

The students were also shown clips about racism, such as ""A Kid Asks About Systemic Racism.""

The school tried to block a parent named Jeff Myers' questions about the materials. The father spoke with Fox News Digital and said he was concerned where the program would go. Myers said his daughter was instructed to remain outside the classroom for three mornings while the lessons were being taught.

""Kids coming late to school would pass by her and stare, wondering if she was out there for being in trouble. My daughter was also upset with me, as she was told I asked for it,"" Myers said. ""The district had this principal's back and supported all the decisions she made, including removing my daughter without our knowledge or consent. She never even bothered apologizing to my daughter or the teacher who she stuck in the middle of this.""

The principal, Cynthia Lam Moffett, resigned Friday, according to the parent.

The curricula also contained the district's vision statement which stated that, ""Beaverton School District owns that our student outcomes currently point to our part in perpetuating institutional racism, and we commit to actions that address the current culture that is leading to these outcomes.""

It continued, ""We will work to dismantle policies and systems that perpetuate institutional racism and barriers to education and other school-related activities… Eliminating racism and all forms of bias is fundamental to our work — not just a part of our work. We commit to removing racism, white supremacy, hate speech and all forms of bigotry from our schools and communities.""

1008,House Republicans demand answers from Biden admin over grants 'to promote atheism worldwide',Houston Keene,"

FIRST ON FOX: Several House Republicans are demanding answers from the Biden administration regarding a grant program the Republicans say will ""promote atheism worldwide.""

Republican Study Committee (RSC) chairman Jim Banks of Indiana led the letter with 14 of his GOP colleagues to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken regarding the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor’s (DRL) grant program promoting atheism and ""humanism.""

""The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) was officially titled ‘DRL FY20 IRF Promoting and Defending Religious Freedom Inclusive of Atheist, Humanist, Non-Practicing and Non-Affiliated Individuals,’"" Banks and the Republicans wrote.

HOUSE GOP GRILL STATE DEPT ON SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR RACIAL EQUITY AND JUSTICE, ‘LEFT-WING SOCIAL AGENDA’

""It announced a ‘competitive’ process that would award grants of up to $500,000 to organizations committed to the practice and spread of atheism and humanism, namely in South/Central Asia and in the Middle East/North Africa,"" they continued.

The Republicans pointed out that atheism and ""humanism"" are both ""official belief systems"" protected under the First Amendment’s right to religious freedom and said they would ""like to know what other United States government programs supported with appropriated funds are being used either to encourage, inculcate, or to disparage any official belief system – atheist, humanist, Christian, Muslim, or otherwise.""

Banks and his colleagues wrote that it ""is one thing for the Department to be tolerant and respectful of a wide range of belief systems"" and ""to encourage governments to respect the religious freedom interests of their citizens.""

b""It is quite another for the United States government to work actively to empower atheists, humanists, non-practicing, and non-affiliated in public decision-making,"" the letter read. ""Any such program – for any religiously-identifiable group – in the United States would be unconstitutional.""

""In addition to its constitutionally dubious legal foundation, we also question how such a grant or cooperative agreement program advances the foreign policy interests of the United States,"" it continued. ""Were such programs known by the citizens of the target countries, we would expect that local populations, interest groups, and governments would bristle at what any ‘objective observer’ would see as ‘covert’ funding from a foreign power designed to shatter local religious and cultural relationships.""

The Republicans wrote that this is ""not ‘religious freedom’"" and the DRL’s NOFO on the subject ""prioritizes atheists and humanists above all other potential recipients."" They also argued that the prioritization violates ""both the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses"" as well as the ""the No Religious Test Clause of Article VI"" of the Constitution.

""In the NOFO, the State Department characterizes atheists as a unique religious group while then encouraging the building of ""networks and advocacy groups"" for atheists,"" the letter read. ""This would be analogous to official State Department promotion of religious freedom ‘particularly for Christians’ in China, with the express goal being to build a corresponding missionary network.""

""Obviously, this goal that would never pass constitutional muster and would be derided by radical leftist bureaucrats in your agency as completely out-of-bounds,"" they continued. ""So why is this atheist NOFO not viewed with similar objection?""

HOUSE OVERSIGHT GOP PROBE BLINKEN ON STATE DEPARTMENT’S ‘GLOBAL WOKE CZAR’

The lawmakers wrote that ""Americans rightly discern this as a part of the broader effort on the part of your administration to promote radical, progressive orthodoxy abroad"" and highlighted that atheism ""is an integral part of the belief system of Marxism and communism.""

""A few weeks ago, the United States Embassy in Germany erected a ‘Black Lives Matter’ flag. Americans should be very alarmed at this. It’s not only that ‘Black Lives Matter’ remains a highly divisive and increasingly unpopular movement here in the United States; the display is also denoting a promotion of a specific radical organization. Other recent initiatives of the State Department include creating a ‘Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice,’ whose mission will be to spread Critical Race Theory and other progressive dogmas worldwide, and working to remove restrictions on abortion around the globe.""

Banks and his colleagues concluded the letter with a list of 12 questions regarding the grant program and how it helps U.S. foreign policy.

Joining Banks on the letter are several prominent Republican lawmakers, including Reps. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, Lisa McClain of Michigan, and Tim Walberg of Michigan.

Banks’ caucus is already taking steps to address the Biden administration’s adoption of leftward policies.

The RSC 2023 budget proposal would ""ban any funds from going to any attempt by the State Department to promote anti-American ideas such as Critical Race Theory (CRT) or to allow the U.N. to audit the U.S. human rights record.""

""Last year, the State Department invited the U.N. Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on minority issues for an official visit to examine the U.S. human rights record,"" the RSC budget reads. ""The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism E. Tendayi Achiume, is a member of the critical race studies program and is a proponent of CRT.""

The Republicans’ letter comes as the Biden administration takes heat for its slew of liberal policies that have raised serious red flags.

A bust of President Abraham Lincoln and a plaque of the Gettysburg address have been removed from a Cornell University library.

""Someone complained, and it was gone,"" Cornell biology professor Randy Wayne told the College Fix of the matter.

The bust of Lincoln and the bronzed plaque of the former president’s historic 1863 address had been in the Kroch Library, where the university’s Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections is located, since 2013.

Wayne said that he noticed the display was missing a few weeks ago and asked librarians what happened. He was told the display was removed after some type of complaint, but did not provide further details, according to the College Fix.

The communications team for Cornell told Fox News Digital that the display was a ""temporary exhibit"" installed to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address in 2013.

""President Lincoln’s bust was part of a temporary exhibit on the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address. The bust was on display in the Rare and Manuscript Collections from 2013 to 2021,"" Rebecca Valli, director of media relations at Cornell University, told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

""Cornell proudly possesses one of five known copies of the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln’s hand. The original is safely sequestered, with a digital facsimile on permanent display. Additionally, five electronic Lincoln exhibitions are available for 24/7 viewing online,"" Valli added.

Valli did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on Wayne’s claim that librarians had informed him the display was removed after a complaint. Fox News also reached out to the school’s library inquiring about his claim but did not receive a response.

Photos of where the display was once held show the area now sits barren.

Before Valli issued comment about the display to the media, Wayne had emailed Cornell’s president, Martha E. Pollack, on June 23 inquiring whether she was aware the display was removed and why, according to email correspondence reviewed by Fox News Digital. The email went unanswered until Tuesday when a staffer for Pollack’s office responded that ""President Pollack isn’t typically made aware of changes with exhibitions in the library, which I believe are decided upon by library staff.""

Wayne said he believes no one ""has the whole story at this time"" about the removed display, and emphasized the importance the Gettysburg Address has for him and his students.

1012,"Supreme Court hands Biden victory, allows end to 'Remain in Mexico' policy",Ronn Blitzer,"

The Supreme Court ruled Thursday in a 5-4 decision that the Biden administration can repeal the Trump administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly known as the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, reversing a lower court ruling.

Under that policy, migrants seeking entry into the U.S. had to stay in Mexico as they awaited hearings. The Trump administration put the policy in place so that migrants would not be released into the U.S. The Biden administration had tried to repeal the policy but was previously blocked by a lower court. At issue was whether the Department of Homeland Security's suspension and subsequent termination of the policy violated a federal law that requires that migrants be detained or, if they arrived from a contiguous country, sent back.

""[T]he Government’s rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act], and the October 29 Memoranda did constitute final agency action,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the Court's opinion.

The statute Roberts cited, 8 U.S.C. Section 1225, says that someone applying for admission ""shall be detained for a proceeding"" unless they are ""clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted,"" and also says if they are from a contiguous territory like Mexico, ""the Attorney General may return the alien to that territory"" as they await a hearing. Texas and Missouri had pointed to this language in arguing that the Remain in Mexico policy was necessary to adhere to this law. Without the ability to detain everyone, the states argued in their lawsuit, sending them back when possible is necessary.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER ‘REMAIN IN MEXICO’ BORDER POLICY

The court's majority pointed to the language in the law that says the government ""may return"" migrants to a contiguous territory, noting the ""discretionary"" nature of the wording. While all sides agreed on that, it was the states' interpretation – and that of a lower court ruling -- that a return is required if a person is not detained that the court disputed.

""The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that,"" Roberts wrote in his opinion, in which he was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh. Roberts explained that had Congress meant for a return to be mandatory in the event that there was a lack of compliance with the detention requirement, it would have said so in clear language.

JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS WON'T BE FIRED FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY DESPITE STUDENT OUTRAGE

""The statutory grant of discretion here contains no such caveat, and we will not rewrite it to include one,"" Roberts wrote.

The court also pointed to ""the foreign affairs consequences"" of requiring a return, pointing to how the Constitution only authorizes the Executive Branch to handle ""direct diplomacy"" with other countries, and how the lower court's ruling against the Biden administration would have ""imposed a significant burden upon the Executive’s ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico.""

The court argued that the Return to Mexico policy ""applies exclusively to non-Mexican nationals who have arrived at ports of entry that are located 'in the United States,'"" and that therefore the Executive Branch ""cannot unilaterally return these migrants to Mexico."" Roberts cited a Biden administration claim that the policy has negatively impacted other areas of relations with Mexico.

""Yet under the Court of Appeals’ interpretation, section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorized the District Court to force the Executive to the bargaining table with Mexico, over a policy that both countries wish to terminate, and to supervise its continuing negotiations with Mexico to ensure that they are conducted ‘in good faith,’"" Roberts wrote. ""That stark consequence confirms our conclusion that Congress did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to tie the hands of the Executive in this manner.""

The court also noted that Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security the discretion to utilize a third option for migrants, which is parole.

""Every administration, including the Trump and Biden administrations, has utilized this authority to some extent,"" the court said.

Ruling that repealing the Remain in Mexico policy does not violate the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Supreme Court said the lower court should now look for the first time at whether the Biden administration's Oct. 29, 2021 memo terminating the policy was in compliance with Administrative Procedure Act protocols that govern the actions of federal agencies.

Justice Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, also referenced the parole option, stating that both parole and return ""are legally permissible options,"" meaning that the Return to Mexico policy is not mandatory.

SUPREME COURT DEALS BIDEN CLIMATE AGENDA SERIOUS BLOW WITH EPA DECISION

Justice Barrett, in a dissenting opinion, said she agreed with the majority's view of the relevant immigration law, but believed that the court's opinion in a separate case issued two weeks ago impacted the issue of whether lower courts had the jurisdiction to hear the case in the first place. Instead of ruling on the case, she argued, the Supreme Court should have sent the case back down for the lower court to consider the recent decision.

""I agree with the Court’s analysis of the merits—but not with its decision to reach them,"" Barrett wrote.

In a more contentious dissent, Justice Samuel Alito – joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch – argued that the government does not have the authority to release migrants into the U.S. if it is believed that they are not eligible for admission.

""When it appears that one of these aliens is not admissible, may the Government simply release the alien in this country and hope that the alien will show up for the hearing at which his or her entitlement to remain will be decided? Congress has provided a clear answer to that question, and the answer is no,"" Alito wrote, citing statutory language that in such a case, a migrant ""shall be detained"" for either removal or consideration of an asylum application.

While Alito acknowledged – as Roberts and Kavanaugh had – that returning a migrant who came from a contiguous territory is only one alternative along with parole, he cited a separate law that said parole is only to be used ""on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit.""

When pressed on whether the Secret Service members would speak on growing narrative discrepancies in witness testimonies, Cheney demurred.

Two Secret Service agents are prepared to testify before Congress that then-President Donald Trump did not lunge at a steering wheel or assault them in an attempt to go to the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot, a source close to the Secret Service tells Fox News.

The explosive new allegations were made on Tuesday by Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.

When Trump's top Secret Service agent Robert Engel told the former president that he could not go to the Capitol for security reasons, Trump exploded at him, according to Hutchinson.

""When Bobby had relayed to him we're not, we don't have the assets to do it… the president had very strong, very angry response to that. Tony described him as being irate,"" Hutchinson said.

Gloria Allred, a high-power attorney representing 33 women who accused Bill Cosby of misconduct, has said that she is proceeding with a new civil trial against the disgraced actor in Los Angeles County.

Cosby, 83, served more than two years of a three to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia after being convicted of aggravated indecent assault. He was released on Wednesday after his conviction was overturned on technical grounds.

In a press conference held after Cosby's release, Allred, who also represents accusers in various other high-profile sexual misconduct suits, said that ""Mr. Cosby is not home free"" and stated that she will pursue a new civil suit.

In the lawsuit, Allred will represent a woman who alleges that she is a victim of child sexual abuse by the ""Cosby Show"" star. The accuser claims Cosby abused her at the Playboy mansion in Southern California in her youth.

Allred will hold a status conference with the court in Santa Monica, Calif., in August to inform the Los Angeles County Superior Court of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to overturn the conviction at that time.

""We do expect that a date will be set for any further discovery and for trial of our case very soon by the court,"" she said.

The new case will include a second deposition under oath of Cosby, Allred said.

In other words to appear to answer questions under oath again,"" the attorney said. ""Over his objection, the court granted our motion to compel a second deposition of Mr. Cosby.""

The second deposition was also stayed until the conclusion of the criminal trial.

""Because his criminal case is now concluded and because he is not in jeopardy of being criminally prosecuted, he will not be able to invoke his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination in our case.""

Three Kentucky police officers and a police canine were killed and at least four other officers were injured following a shootout in a residential area in the city of Allen Thursday night, police said.

Prestonsburg Police Capt. Ralph Frasure and Deputy William Petry were identified among the deceased, as well as K9 Drago and Canine Handler Jacob Chaffins, Kentucky State Police said.

Lance Storz, 49, was taken into custody following a shootout at his home, as two officers arrived to serve him an arrest warrant shortly before 7 p.m. Storz, armed with a rifle, opened fire and struck both officers, the Prestonsburg Police Department said.

Floyd County Sheriff John Hunt told reporters Friday that the officers encountered ""pure hell"" when they arrived on the scene, saying they had ""no chance.""

Other officers from different jurisdictions responded to the incident and at least four were injured, they added.

""It’s heartbreaking, you know, anytime you have a loss of life,"" Trooper Matt Gayheart of Kentucky State Police told Fox 56.

1019,Trump considering early 2024 announcement amid opposition from other Republicans: reports,Kyle Morris,"

Former President Donald Trump has hinted for some time that he may announce a third bid for the White House, and some Republicans, including those that have expressed opposition to another run from Trump, suggest that announcement could come sooner rather than later as GOP voters weigh their best option for a 2024 candidate.

While most candidates announce a run for the presidency around one year prior to the election, several Republican strategists, according to reports from The New York Times and The Associated Press, suggest that Trump is eager to announce his candidacy even though many Republicans feel at odds with the idea.

Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist, said that he believes Trump's announcement could come before more Republican voters begin to consider other candidates.

""There’s some evidence that some Republican voters are trying to slow-walk from Donald Trump,"" Jennings told the Times. ""If you’re in his shoes, you have to try to put that fire out. Because the more it burns.""

Other Republicans have signaled that it's time to move on from Trump in hopes of winning back the White House in the next presidential election.

2024 WATCH: TRUMP, PENCE PRAISE SUPREME COURT RULING, BUT PENCE PUSHES TO FURTHER FIGHT AGAINST ABORTION

In the wake of recent hearings on the January 6 Capitol protests, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told The Associated Press that voters are ""concerned"" with whether Trump could pull off an election victory in 2024. ""People are concerned that we could lose the election in ’24 and want to make sure that we don’t nominate someone who would be seriously flawed,"" Christie said.

Similarly, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is rumored to be considering a run for president in 2024, suggested Trump is liable to lose the election.

""His approval among Republican primary voters has already been somewhat diminished,"" Hogan said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""Trump was the least popular president in American history until Joe Biden.""

Also echoing comments from Hogan and Christie is Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence, an individual considered by many to be a likely 2024 Republican candidate.

""Republican activists believed Donald Trump was the only candidate who could beat Hillary,"" Short told The Associated Press. ""Now, the dynamic is reversed. He is the only one who has lost to Joe Biden.""

BILL MAHER: TRUMP COULD WIN 2024 ‘SO EASY’ IF HE'D ‘JUST LET GO’ OF 2020

Jason Shepherd, a Georgia Republican Party state committeeman and a former aide to Newt Gingrich, said voters will have a wide-variety of candidates to choose from in the 2024 election, suggesting that Trump could have trouble garnering the nomination outright.

​​""There will be a number of Republicans who many Republicans feel cannot only unite the party but would govern with strong, conservative policies,"" Shepherd told the Times.

Likely to face opposition from many within his own party over a run for president in 2024, Trump is sure to have the backing of several prominent Republicans.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who often saw eye to eye with Trump and sometimes pushed back on statements from the former president that he disagreed with, insisted that Trump's success if he should run will depend on what he says and how he acts. Graham said he must compare and contrast the economic climate from two or three years ago with what Americans are witnessing today.

""It’s up to him if he runs or not,"" Graham said in an interview shared by the Times. ""But the key to him being successful is comparing his policy agenda and policy successes with what is going on today.""

Several potential 2024 candidates have vowed not to challenge Trump should he run for re-election, including Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who served as ambassador to the United Nations under Trump. But now, with everything that has taken place since Trump left the White House, Haley hinted to reporters that she might reconsider.

""If it looks like there’s a place for me next year, I’ve never lost a race, I’m not going to start now,"" Haley said. ""I’ll put 1,000% in and I’ll finish it. And if there’s not a place for me, I will fight for this country until my last breath.""

Haley told host Harris Faulkner on ""The Faulkner Focus"" that she will reveal her decision on whether to seek the presidency early next year.

A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released Friday showed that 64% of registered voters believe President Biden ""is showing he is too old to be President,"" while another 71% said Biden should not seek another term in the White House. Sixty-one percent of voters who were surveyed said Trump should not run for office again, citing his role in division among Americans, his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol protests, and his unpredictable behavior.",https://www.foxnews.com
1020,Pools close as lifeguard shortage hits American cities this summer,Cortney Moore,"

The U.S. has a shortage of lifeguards, and it’s taking a toll on swimming centers throughout the country.

Cities such as Indianapolis and Chicago, have responded to the shortage by closing pools and limiting hours of operation in order to keep the public safe from accidental drowning, the Associated Press reports.

Professionals in the lifeguarding space are also worried that Americans will turn to beaches and lakes where there are no lifeguards on duty, which of course puts swimmers at a higher risk of drowning, especially when summer heat waves lead people to seek out ways to cool down.

Bernard J. Fisher II, the director of health and safety at the American Lifeguard Association, told the Associated Press he thinks the current shortage ""is a disaster.""

AMERICA'S LIFEGUARD SHORTAGE WILL BE 'A TOTAL DISASTER COME AUGUST'

He noted that lifeguard certification programs were temporarily stopped during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and starting pay can be low in some cities compared to other jobs.

In 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that lifeguards and other recreational protective service workers made a mean hourly wage of $13.14 and a mean annual wage of $27,320.

Current data from the career website and job board Zippia suggests that there might be more than 67,656 certified lifeguards who are working in America.

That number is small when factoring in how many commercial swimming centers and natural bodies of water there are in the country.

Statisticians at the Association of Pool & Spa Professionals estimate there are 309,000 public swimming pools while geologists estimate there are tens of thousands of beaches and lakes, respectively.

NYC CANCELS SWIM CLASSES AMID LIFEGUARD SHORTAGE NATIONWIDE

Lifeguard requirements vary by city and state, but generally, candidates should be able to swim a long distance, tread water, complete a timed rescue and know how to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillation (AED).

For example, lifeguards in New York City must be at least 16 years old, have at least 20/30 vision in one eye and 20/40 in the other and be able to swim 50 yards in 35 seconds or less with proper form, according to the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation, while lifeguards in New York State must be at least 17 years old, have at least 20/70 vision in both eyes and swim 100 yards in 75 seconds or less, according to the NYS Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

In the state of Florida, the minimum age is 15 years old (varies by city) and prerequisites include being able to swim 300 yards continuously, tread water for two minutes, complete a timed event in under two minutes and surface dive seven to 10 feet and retrieve a 10-pound object, according to LifeguardAndSafetyTraining.com – a nonprofit lifeguard certifier.

Beaches, of course, have more challenging swim requirements, given the nature of changing tides, rip currents, natural debris and wildlife.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there are 3,960 fatal unintentional drownings and 8,080 nonfatal drownings in the U.S. each year.

LA LIFEGUARD'S PAY TOPS $500,000, INVESTIGATION DISCOVERS

A ""Lifeguard Effectiveness"" report published by the CDC found that American lifeguards rescue an estimated 100,000 people from drowning annually.

""Lifeguards play an important role in a swimming facility’s risk management program,"" the CDC wrote.

""The presence of lifeguards may deter behaviors that could put swimmers at risk for drowning, such as horseplay or venturing into rough or deep water, much like increased police presence can deter crime,"" the CDC’s report added.

""Lifeguards are trained to monitor the aquatic environment, supervise patrons, inform patrons about the potential for injury, educate them about the consequences of injury producing behavior, and enforce rules and regulations that prevent injuries,"" the agency added.

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem was asked during CNN's ""State of the Union"" if her state would force a 10-year-old to have a baby after a girl in Ohio was denied a procedure due to the state's abortion ban.

""Because this is a trigger law that was passed before you became governor, I wanted you to be clear — will the state of South Dakota going forward force a 10-year-old in that very same situation to have a baby?"" CNN's Dana Bash asked the governor during Sunday's show.

The Indianapolis Star reported Friday that a 10-year-old girl in Ohio who was six weeks and three days pregnant was unable to receive an abortion due to Ohio's law banning abortions after six weeks when fetal cardiac activity begins.

The girl was on her way to Indiana where an abortion ban is yet to take effect. State lawmakers have scheduled a special session on inflation and abortion for July 25 where they are expected to include an abortion ban, according to WFYI.

""As much as we talk about what we can do for that little girl, I think we also need to be addressing those sick individuals that do this to our children.""

Noem said the law in South Dakota stated abortions were illegal unless to save the life of the mother. Bash then asked if Noem would be OK with having a 10-year-old girl have a baby.

""No, I am never OK with that. In fact, that story will keep me up at night,"" Noem said in response.

Bash asked if South Dakota would change the law to have an exception, but Noem did not directly address the question.

""How is a 10-year-old girl physically — probably can't even carry a baby without, being never mind emotionally and mentally tormented, but physically hurt. Would you consider that the life of a mother at risk?"" Bash asked Noem.

Noem said it would be up to the doctors, family members, and those closest to her that would have to make a decision on the matter at hand.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in a landmark decision on June 24, handing down the question of abortion to the states. The decision ultimately ended the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion.

""The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority.

Several Republican states have already passed ""trigger laws"", immediately restriction abortion access after the decision was announced. Likewise, many pro-choice advocates are working to codify Roe or pass looser abortion restrictions at the state level.

Police have not taken a suspect into custody.

Around the same time a man was grazed in the head by a bullet close to the scene of Friday's Chinatown shooting, with the man telling police he heard people arguing nearby before gunfire erupted. The 18-year-old man was taken to Stroger Hospital and was listed in good condition. Police do not have a suspect in custody.

On Sunday afternoon at 12:48 p.m., a man who is between 25 and 35 years old was shot multiple times in the head, upper torso, and body, according to police. He was transported to Christ Hospital and pronounced dead. Police say the victim was walking down S.

1024,Ethan Liming 911 call prompts more questions about 17-year-old's beating death,Audrey Conklin,"

FIRST ON FOX – A 911 call made to police in Akron, Ohio, on June 2 prompts more questions about the fatal beating of 17-year-old Ethan Liming.

Liming was beaten to death on his last day as a junior in high school after what authorities describe as a fight between the two friend groups that began when Liming's friends discharged a toy water bead gun at a group of men on a school basketball court.

""We’re at the I Promise school in Akron, Ohio,"" a 911 call from one of Liming's friends placed at 10:42 p.m. on the night of the fight says. ""Our friend just got knocked out. We don’t know what to do.""

The operator asks if there is a fight going on at the caller's location.

A voice in the background of the call can be heard saying, ""Hey, man. We’re sorry, man. We didn’t mean it.""

The caller then responds to the operator's question, saying ""there was"" a fight going on before adding, ""Yeah. It’s okay, though. It’s cool now. It’s cool now.""

The operator asks whether Liming is breathing, to which the caller responds, ""Yeah, he’s breathing. He’s breathing.""

At that point, a voice in the background of the call can be heard saying, ""I’m not trying to fight, though,"" along with some other indiscernible voices and noises before the call abruptly ends, leaving the operator hanging.

It is unclear if the fight had ended or escalated at that point.

Akron officials arrested three suspects connected to Liming's killing on June 11, including 20-year old Deshawn Stafford Jr., 19-year-old Tyler Stafford, and 21-year-old Donovon Jones. They are being held on $1 million bond. Each pleaded not guilty during Monday’s arraignment.

Police said during a June 8 press conference that they had received a phone call just before 10:50 p.m. on June 2 regarding a fight in a parking lot next to an elementary school basketball court.

ETHAN LIMING DEATH: POLICE SAY TEEN, 17, WAS ‘ASSAULTED’ FOLLOWING WATER GUN INCIDENT

The court — which is apparently lit at all hours of the night, according to Liming's father, Bill Liming — is part of a public elementary school in Akron supported by the LeBron James Family Foundation called the "" I Promise School .""

Officers arrived within three minutes of the first 911 call and found Ethan lying on the ground in the parking lot. Authorities attempted life-saving measures but were unable to revive the teenager, and he was pronounced dead at the scene, Akron Police Chief Steve Mylett told reporters.

Ethan and three of his friends had driven into the parking lot of the basketball court that night so that they could text their friends to make plans for the remainder of the evening, the elder Liming previously told Fox News Digital.

Two of his friends got out of the vehicle and started shooting a toy ""SplatRBall"" gun, which is described as a rechargeable, full-auto and semi-auto water bead gun. The water beads explode when they hit a target. The toy gun is listed as $68 on Walmart's website.

DHS WARNS OF ‘HEIGHTENED THREAT ENVIRONMENT,' VIOLENT MONTHS AHEAD

Ethan's father said his son has hit him with the toy gun before, and the gel bullets feel like a ""rubber band snap.""

The two boys playing with the water bead gun then began shooting toward a group of four individuals playing on the basketball court. Eventually, an altercation ensued between the four individuals on the basketball court and the four boys in the parking lot, including Ethan.

Three occupants of the vehicle, including Ethan, were assaulted, according to the elder Liming.

Police documents previously obtained by Fox News Digital described how suspects Deshawn Stafford and Tyler Stafford ""took Liming’s car and drove it to the other end of the lot"" when Ethan's friends tried to take him to the hospital, but one of the men’s attorneys cast doubt upon the pair’s intentions when moving the vehicle.

Jonathan Sinn, who represents DeShawn ""Shawn"" Stafford, said that while the suspects did take away the water bead gun and the car after the alleged fight, they were not moving the car to prevent Liming from getting to the hospital. Instead, they did so to keep Ethan and his friends on the scene until police arrived, Sinn said — despite that his client and the other suspects also allegedly fled the scene afterward.

Police arrived at the parking lot near the basketball court that night to find ""nobody was on scene,"" Mylett told reporters.

Earlier this week, Sinn told the court Shawn Stafford was trying to defend himself after Shawn, his brother and his cousin saw ""a car-load of teenagers … with, what at the time seemed to be a fully automatic firearm,"" referencing the SplatRBall gun.

Ethan was an honors student at a public school in Akron , where he achieved a 4.03 GPA and played baseball and football, his father told Fox News Digital. He aspired to become a lawyer.

1025,"This July 4th, COVID is still killing hundreds of Americans each day",Fox News Staff,"

Summer in America right now — in terms of the coronavirus — means many infections but relatively few deaths compared to prior versions of the virus, said officials cited by the Associated Press.

COVID-19 is still killing hundreds of Americans each day — yet the virus is not nearly as dangerous as it was last fall and winter.

""It’s going to be a good summer and we deserve this break,"" Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, told the AP.

With more Americans shielded from severe illness through vaccination and infection, COVID-19 — at least for the time being — has transformed into an unpleasant, inconvenient nuisance for many.

ADVENTUROUS CHILDHOOD PLAY MAY BUFFER AGAINST ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION: STUDY

""It's like having a bad cold or the flu,"" one woman in Massachusetts said recently.

She also said, ""If I get it, I get it — and I'll get over it."" She's been doubled vaxxed and boosted against COVID, she said.

Depending on location, many Americans are still wearing masks when they enter grocery stores or go to other public places, even though the stores or venues may not require them. Many are still masking up outdoors, too, when they're among large crowds.

Some shops are also still requiring masking in order to enter.

Yet other Americans want nothing to do with masks at this point.

Dr. Dan Kaul, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, told the AP that things ""feel cautiously good right now.""

""For the first time that I can remember, pretty much since it started, we don’t have any [coronavirus] patients in the ICU,"" he said.

As the nation marks July 4th this year, the average number of daily deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. is hovering around 360.

AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL; 50 MUST-SEE LANDMARKS THAT TELL OUR NATIONAL STORY

Last year, during a similar summer lull, that number was at roughly 228 per day in early July.

That remains the lowest threshold in U.S. daily deaths since March 2020, when the virus first began to spread across the U.S.

Today, in the third year of the pandemic, it’s easy to feel confused by the mixed picture.

But there were far fewer reported cases at this time last year — fewer than 20,000 a day.

Now, it’s about 109,000 — and likely an undercount as tests done at home aren’t routinely reported.

Today, in the third year of the pandemic, it’s easy to feel confused by the mixed picture: Repeat infections are increasingly likely, the AP reported, and a sizeable share of those infected will face the lingering symptoms of what has become known as long COVID-19.

Many worries are also now eased, however.

""We’re now at a point that everyone’s immune system has seen either the virus or the vaccine two or three times by now,"" Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told the AP.

""What we’re seeing is that people are getting less and less ill on average,"" Dowdy said.

As many as 8 out of 10 people in the U.S. have been infected at least once, according to one influential model, the AP pointed out.

Big differences separate the flu from COVID-19. Health experts continue to be surprised by the behavior of the coronavirus.

Recently the death rate for COVID-19 has been a moving target. It's now it's fallen to within the range of an average flu season, according to data analyzed by Arizona State University health industry researcher Mara Aspinall.

At first, some people said coronavirus was no more deadly than the flu — ""and for a long period of time, that wasn’t true,"" Aspinall said.

Back then, people had no immunity. Treatments were experimental — and vaccines weren't yet available en masse.

Aspinall said that today, the built-up immunity has driven down the death rate to solidly in the range of a typical flu season. (In the past decade, the death rate for the flu was about 5% to 13% of those hospitalized.)

Big differences separate the flu from COVID-19. Health experts continue to be surprised by the behavior of the coronavirus. It's also still unclear whether it will settle into a flu-like seasonal pattern.

Last summer — when vaccinations first became widely available in the U.S. — the U.S. had to suffer through the delta surge and then omicron, which peaked last February and took the lives of 2,600 Americans a day, the AP reported.

The fast-spreading omicron subtypes BA.4 and BA.5 may also contribute to a change in the death numbers, said experts.

Experts agree it is possible that a new variant might arise and be capable of escaping the population’s built-up immunity. The fast-spreading omicron subtypes BA.4 and BA.5 may also contribute to a change in the death numbers.

In the next weeks, deaths could edge up in many states but the U.S. as a whole is likely to see deaths decline slightly, said Nicholas Reich, who aggregates coronavirus projections for the COVID-19 Forecast Hub in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""We’ve seen COVID hospitalizations increase to around 5,000 new admissions each day from just over 1,000 in early April. But deaths due to COVID have only increased slightly over the same time period,"" said Reich, a professor of biostatistics at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Unvaccinated people have a six times higher risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with people with at least a primary series of shots, the CDC estimated based on available data from April.

US RELIGIOUS LEADERS EXPLAIN WHY FAITH IN GOD HIT LOWEST LEVEL EVER, SAY COVID MADE IT WORSE

This summer, consider your own vulnerability and that of those around you, especially in large gatherings since the virus is spreading so rapidly, said Dowdy of Hopkins.

""There are still people who are very much at risk,"" he said.

Many vaccinated Americans, however, are shunning yet another booster.

GOING AWAY THIS SUMMER? MAKE SURE TO AVOID CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING

""I'm double-vaccinated and I've been boosted once,"" one New Yorker told Fox News Digital. ""That's enough. No more boosters for me.""

He also pointed out that in his ""civilian"" opinion (he is not a doctor), it's quite possible that those who are perishing from COVID today had pre-existing conditions or other complications.

1027,Rob Schneider slams Alec Baldwin's 'SNL' Trump portrayal: 'I don't find his impression to be comical',Jennifer Earl,"

Rob Schneider thinks Alec Baldwin's ""Saturday Night Live"" Donald Trump impersonation is ruining the show because Baldwin has let his personal politics take center stage.

""The fun of 'Saturday Night Live' was [...] you never knew which way they leaned politically,"" Schneider told The New York Daily News on Friday. ""You kind of assumed they would lean more left and liberal, but now the cat's out of the bag [and] they are completely against Trump, which I think makes it less interesting because you know the direction the piece is going.""

The former ""SNL"" regular compared Baldwin's performance to comedian Dana Carvey's impression of George H.W. Bush in the late '80s and '90s.

Carvey recently appeared on ""Conan"" to discuss his 25-year friendship with the former president. Over the years, Carvey said he grew close to Bush, even exchanging phone numbers.

""You kind of assumed they would lean more left and liberal, but now the cat's out of the bag they are completely against Trump, which I think makes it less interesting because you know the direction the piece is going."" — Rob Schneider

""We had so many warm moments with them ... It was a different time,"" Carvey admitted.

ANN COULTER'S UC BERKELEY DEBACLE: ROB SCHNEIDER DEFENDS FREE SPEECH

Schneider says Baldwin's impression of Trump is different from Carvey's playful impersonation of Bush.

""Carvey played it respectfully,"" Schneider said. ""To me, the genius of Dana Carvey was Dana always had empathy for the people he played, and Alec Baldwin has nothing but a fuming, seething anger toward the person he plays.""

And it's clear from looking at Baldwin's Twitter account, Schneider says, that he has very strong opinions about the Trump administration.

GEORGE H.W. BUSH 'SNL' IMPERSONATOR DANA CARVEY RECALLS 'FUNNY MOMENT' WITH FORMER PRESIDENT

""I don't find his impression to be comical,"" Schneider told the Daily News. ""Because, like I said, I know the way his politics lean and it spoils any surprise. There's no possible surprise. He so clearly hates the man he's playing.""

""Alec Baldwin has nothing but a fuming, seething anger toward the person he plays."" — Rob Schneider

This isn't the first time Schneider has scolded a public figure for their words and actions against Trump. In January 2017, Schneider came under fire for calling out Rep. John Lewis for not attending Trump’s inauguration and for telling ""Meet the Press"" he's not a “legitimate president.”

“Rep. Lewis, you are a great person. But Dr. King didn’t give in to his anger or his hurt. That is how he accomplished & won Civil Rights,"" Schneider said in a since-deleted tweet posted on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Schneider also attacked UC Berkeley for cancelling conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speech last April, arguing it limited Americans' right to free speech.

""UC Berkeley, after you done eliminating speech you don't like & words you don’t like what’s next?"" the comedian tweeted. ""Maybe add burning books to the curriculum.""

Berkeley asked Coulter to postpone her appearance for a month after protests over the planned speech grew into a nationally watched firestorm.

Schneider reportedly used to consider himself a Democrat but he's since become an Independent — a move he realizes may not be popular with all of his fans.

""Literally if you don't go the party line — you're out. There's a real ugliness to it,"" he explained.

He clarified his comments in a tweet early Friday, saying he ""greatly admires"" Baldwin but adds it's ""more fun to play the middle.""

Schneider is now starring in his own Netflix series called ""Real Rob,"" which is based on his family and struggles with fame. He says Season 3 of the comedy is on its way.

1030,Somali music festival boos Ilhan Omar in Minnesota: 'Get the f--- out of here',Peter Aitken,"

A viral video shows Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., arriving to a chorus of jeers and booing at a mostly Somali crowd in her homes state over the July 4th weekend.

Omar, 39, made an appearance at the concert featuring Somali singer Soldaan Seraar at the Target Center in Minneapolis on Saturday night, but not everyone was happy to see her.

Omar shared a 14-second clip of her and husband Tim Mynett walking out on stage, but longer videos – which circulated around social media – include people chanting ""get out!"" and telling the Democrat to ""get the f--- out of here.""

The videos do not show what prompted such a strong response, but Newsweek reported that some have blamed Omar’s support for abortion and LGBTQ rights for the backlash.

DEMOCRATS FLOOD AIRWAVES WITH ABORTION ADS IN THE WEEK SINCE MONUMENTAL SUPREME COURT ROE V. WADE RULING

Omar was one of the representatives to appear at pro-choice rallies in Washington, D.C. following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on June 24.

""In almost half of this country, states are ready to ban abortion,"" Omar said at a protest at Union Station. ""Outright ban abortion. That means if you are sick, if you are raped, there is incest, you are forced to have that baby or die,""

Omar has also remained a strong supporter of more aggressive legislative measures to protect abortion rights, such as ending the filibuster so that Congress can try to codify abortion rights into federal law or expanding the Supreme Court to pack it with more liberal judges.

1031,AOC faces backlash as critics point out she wasn't in Capitol building during riot,Sam Dorman,"

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is facing criticism over initial claims she made about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with many noting that she wasn't even in the Capitol when it occurred.

The controversy erupted after the New York congresswoman posted a video in which she described a confrontation with Capitol Police at her office, which is located on the larger Capitol complex. But it is not in the Capitol itself — which includes the dome, the House, and the Senate — and was where many rioters stormed in and were seen breaking windows.

Her office is located in the Cannon building, which is accessible through underground tunnels connected to the Capitol as well as via a short stroll down a walkway and across the street. It was also one of the buildings where staff was told to evacuate after suspicious packages were found in the area. Law enforcement found pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails in the vicinity.

In response to the incident, the congresswoman said: ""I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive."" She also accused Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, of almost having her ""murdered,"" touching on accusations that Cruz and others incited the attack through their rhetoric about the election.

AOC QUESTIONS IF CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER TRIED TO PUT HER IN A 'VULNERABLE SITUATION'

""I can tell you that I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die,"" she said in a video last month.

In her more recent video, she offered an emotional recollection of how she hid behind a bathroom door and heard the police officer break into her office.

""I thought I was going to die,"" she said, noting that she didn't initially realize the person trying to enter her office was police. ""I have never been quieter in my entire life.""

She added that the situation ""didn't feel right because he was looking at me with a tremendous amount of anger and hostility -- and things weren't adding up. There was no partner there and no one was yelling, he wasn't yelling like, 'this is Capitol Police, this is Capitol Police.'""

AOC'S TED CRUZ TWEET SPARKS GROWING PUSHBACK FROM HOUSE REPUBLICANS

Capitol Police did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

On Wednesday, she faced a wave of backlash. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., also blasted media coverage, tweeting that insurrectionists never stormed the hallway that she shares with Ocasio-Cortez. The hashtag #AlexandriaOcasioSmollet trended, an apparent comparison to actor Jussie Smollett, who falsely claimed to be the victim of a hate crime.

Ocasio-Cortez responded to some of the criticism, suggesting that it was ""the latest manipulative take on the right.""

""They are manipulating the fact that most people don’t know the layout the Capitol complex,"" she said. ""We were all on the Capitol complex — the attack wasn’t just on the dome.""

In another tweet, she said: ""People were trying to rush and infiltrate our office buildings — that’s why we had to get evacuated in the first place. The attempts of attackers & publicly available communications show how they tried to gain access and share location info on finding members for physical harm.""

It wasn't immediately clear what she was referring to, and her office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

She later posted about those questioning her account.

1032,"Highland Park shooting suspect description, name released after July 4 parade attack",Michael Ruiz,"

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES : Illinois police are looking for a White male suspect with black hair and a slim build after a gunman attacked an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, a wealthy suburb of Chicago, according to authorities and everyone living near the scene was being told to shelter in place. Investigators believe he is around 19 years old.

Police have recovered a rifle but said the unidentified gunman is still considered armed and dangerous. Authorities identified 22-year-old Robert E. Crimo III, who is considered to be armed and dangerous, as a person of interest and later a suspect. He was driving a 2010 Honda Fit with an Illinois license plate DM80653. He is from the area, authorities said.

He killed at least six people and wounded about two dozen more from a rooftop perch before fleeing, Lake County Sheriff's Office Deputy Chief Chris Covelli said during an afternoon news briefing. Five of those killed were found at the scene and were adults, authorities said. Another was taken to a hospital where they died.

A child was among those hurt and was critically injured, authorities said.

""The families of six individuals woke up today to join a community celebration of our nation's independence,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a news briefing. ""They will go to bed tonight less than whole. There are no words I can offer to lessen the pain of those families who will no longer associate the Fourth of July with celebration, but instead, with grief.""

HIGHLAND PARK, ILLINOIS, FOURTH OF JULY PARADE SHOOTING

The governor said he spoke with President Biden, who pledge federal support.

Gunfire broke out at the intersection of Central Avenue and 2nd Street in Highland Park around 10:24 a.m. CT Monday, according to authorities. The gunman remained at large as of 3 p.m., and police said he had not barricaded himself anywhere or taken hostages to their knowledge.

Covelli said the suspect used ""a high-powered rifle"" but declined to give a detailed description of the weapon. The attack began near the last leg of the parade route, he said, and targeted spectators along the sidelines.

He added that the attack marked a ""very random, very intentional and a very sad day.""

Authorities said the gunman accessed a roof of a business possibly via a ladder in an alley attached to the building.

State police and Chicago officers raced to the scene to assist Highland Park Police in the investigation, and so did deputies from the Lake County Sheriff's Office. The FBI is also assisting, authorities said, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was working on tracing the weapon used in the attack.

ILLINOIS MANHUNT UNDERWAY AFTER 4TH OF JULY PARADE SHOOTING IN HIGHLAND PARK; AT LEAST SIX CONFIRMED DEAD

Officials are asking residents to avoid the area as they continue to hunt for the suspect.

""All we know right now is that he's not in custody, and he's not deceased,"" said Mike Verden, a local resident, the founder and CEO of The Lake Forest Group security consulting firm and a former Secret Service agent, police officer, and senior director of security for the NBA. ""Sometimes these guys get away… Some want to do suicide by cop, some kill themselves, and some just don't want to get caught.""

Verden lives just four miles from the parade route and said he could hear police responding after the attack from his home. Like other area residents, he said he was sheltering in place as police conducted a large-scale search for the suspect.

""The biggest thing right now is that this person is not in custody,"" he said. ""Usually in these types of incidents, they die at the scene…This is kind of unique.""

He said it's normal for authorities to assume the suspect is still armed after recovering a weapon because active shooters typically carry more than one firearm.

The Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned aircraft from flying over Highland Park. The agency issued a five-mile ""Temporary Flight Restriction"" for up to 3,000 feet before canceling it at 3 p.m. local time.

Officials at Highland Park Hospital said they received 26 patients, of which 25 sustained gunshot wounds. The ages of the victims ranged from 8 to 85 years of age. Around 4 to 5 children were among those hurt. Of those injured, 19 were treated and released. Two patients were transferred to Evanston Hospital, said Dr. Brigham Temple, medical director of NorthShore University Health System.

While speaking with reporters, Pritzker advocated for elected officials to do more to prevent gun violence.

""It is devastating that a celebration of America was ripped apart by our uniquely American plague,"" he said. ""I'm furious that yet more innocent lives were taken by gun violence. While we celebrate the Fourth of July just once a year, mass shootings have become our weekly, yes weekly, American tradition.""

The parade began around 10 a.m. at the intersection of Laurel and St. Johns Avenues, less than a mile from the scene of the shooting at Central Avenue and 2nd Street. A celebration called Fourth Fest was supposed to follow the parade at 11 a.m., located at Sunset Park. Authorities canceled the event.

Anyone with video surveillance, phone video, still images, is asked to contact investigators. Business owners in the area asked to review security cameras and share with police, Covelli said, ""even if you don’t see anything in there.""

Phone video posted to social media that appears to have been taken at the scene captured the sound of more than 30 gunshots booming out over the parade as spectators fled in a panic.

1033,"Rush toward green energy has left US 'incredibly' vulnerable to summer blackouts, expert warns",Michael Lee,"

Every area of the U.S. could be in danger of experiencing power outages this summer amid a push to convert to renewable energy sources while taking traditional sources of power offline.

""I think the entire country is incredibly vulnerable, because the entire country is facing a huge energy shortage and I don’t think there is any place that is truly safe,"" Daniel Turner, founder and executive director at Power the Future, told Fox News.

At issue are blackouts that could become widespread across the country this summer as grid operators struggle to meet the increased demand, a problem that has plagued some states for years but now could threaten much of the country.

Turner said some states are under increased threat this year, especially those that have made political pushes to switch over to so-called sources of ""green energy.""

RENEWABLE ENERGY DEPENDENCE COULD LEAD TO ROLLING BLACKOUTS IN MICHIGAN THIS SUMMER

""The areas of the country I’d be most concerned about are the ones that already have inherent weaknesses,"" Turner said. ""Texas, California, New Mexico, New York, all of New England. These are areas whose policies and political decisions have weakened their electric grid.""

The potential outages come as many states have moved to quickly take plants that produce traditional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas offline and switch production over to renewable energy sources, which currently do not have the capacity to keep up with the demand of a hot summer.

Part of the issue with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is that it is dependent on variables outside human control, with some areas not having enough wind or sunshine to continuously produce power. Batteries are in development that could help store excess energy production for later use, but the technology is currently expensive and not fully developed.

That could force grid operators into tough decisions to maintain the integrity of the overall electric grid when demand picks up, but Turner argues that the move to renewable energy is a mistake altogether.

TEXAS POWER GRID OPERATOR URGES RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE ENERGY AS PLANTS GO OFFLINE

The Midwest is particularly vulnerable this summer, even though it has for decades been more immune to the rolling blackouts and brownouts that typically plague the West.

Regulators in Illinois have warned of controlled outages that could occur this summer, with one electric company sending a warning letter to customers during potential heatwaves.

""A recent generation capacity auction has revealed that the Midwest could fall short of needed generation capacity to serve the summer peak load under certain conditions,"" SouthEastern Illinois Electrical Cooperative said in the letter. ""In the event that this happens, your Cooperative would be directed to disconnect a portion of the load in order to prevent an electric grid failure.""

Critics have blamed the potential shortages on Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker’s vow to move the state to 100% renewable energy by 2045, which has caused investment in traditional sources of energy generation to plummet.

""If you look at any country worldwide, or any state in America, that has pushed green energy mandates by government action, not one of them has been successful,"" Turner argued. ""And you can measure that on multiple levels of success, in terms of what they’ve actually purported to or claim that they would produce in terms of electricity, reliability, cost. In terms of actual construction, or cost to the consumers.""

Grid operators in Michigan have also been bracing for the possibility of blackouts this summer, with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's seasonal assessment finding ""capacity shortfalls in both the north and central regions of MISO… leaving those areas at increased risk of temporary, controlled outages to preserve the integrity of the bulk electric system,"" JT Smith, the MISO executive director, told NPR last month.

Michigan has been one of the states pushing to switch over to renewable energy sources while simultaneously taking traditional plants offline, with the Michigan Public Service Commission currently considering taking two more plants offline in the near future.

""Michigan is going down the same route that before it, New Mexico has gone, California has gone,"" Turner said.

GRID OPERATORS WARN OF ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE AMID SWITCH TO RENEWABLES: REPORT

Electric companies in the state have resorted to calls for action, taking to social media to urge their customers to demand the state keep the plants online.

""We need your help to keep the lights on in Michigan this summer and beyond,"" Thumb Electric Cooperative General Manager Dallas Braun said on Facebook Monday. ""Electric reliability is at risk today and demand is projected to grow. As soon as this WEEK Michigan regulators are considering closing down more power plants in Michigan. Please join ME in telling them that reliability matters and that they shouldn’t prematurely close these plants.""

Joe Trotter, the Energy, Environment, and Agriculture Task Force director for the American Legislative Exchange Council, told Fox News last month that policymakers should be more aware of the impact their decisions will have on their constituents.

""Our leaders need to be real cognizant of the day-to-day impact,"" Trotter said. ""It’s great to look at the future, but the present has a huge impact on their constituencies.""

STAYING SAFE DURING EXTENDED POWER OUTAGES: WHAT TO DO IN THE ABSENCE OF HEAT, REFRIGERATION AND ELECTRICITY

Meanwhile, Turner argued that the outages are most likely to affect people from poor and minority neighborhoods.

""They will choose what neighborhoods go into darkness,"" Turner said. ""Historically, when we have done this, we have chosen poor and usually minority neighborhoods to do that.""

Previously planned power outages in states such as California have a history of disproportionately impacting poor neighborhoods, including one instance in 2019 where a poor, mostly Hispanic neighborhood in Sonoma County had its power cut for eight days in October. The deliberate outages not only plunged residents of the area into darkness for days, but the resulting food spoilage strained already tight budgets.

""Even if the electricity doesn’t arrive… the bills do,"" one resident said at the time.

HIGHER GAS PRICES ARE ‘ACCEPTED’ BY AMERICANS AMID TRAVEL DEMAND, ENERGY ECONOMIST SAYS

""Look who they shut off. Have you ever seen a Kardashian complain about lack of power, or Silicon Valley… Facebook’s headquarters? They’re all fine… they’re never the ones plunged into darkness,"" Turner said.

Turner noted that there are trade-offs when policymakers decide to switch to renewable sources of energy, arguing that one such trade-off is increased suffering for people.

""Just watch and see what neighborhoods get turned off,"" he continued. ""Watch and see what happens in neighborhoods in California, New Mexico, and New York that are turned off the grid. That will tell you what our politicians think about their constituents and will tell you what effect the green agenda has on our country.""

RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES DRAIN TEXAS COUNTY'S FUEL BUDGET, PUT PRESSURE ON FIRST RESPONDERS

But some argue that renewable energy sources are not the problem, instead pointing to climate change-driven heatwaves that stress the grid beyond its limits, regardless of what source of energy is used.

""Climate change is fueling extreme heat, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes, which are overtaxing America’s outdated power grid,"" Climate Nexus said in an analysis earlier this month, citing a North American Electric Reliability Corporation report that argued ""extreme temperatures, ongoing drought, and supply chain issues could strain the power grid in vast regions across the country.""

The analysis noted that there is a ""growing rate of record-breaking climate events,"" which it argued contributes to both climate change and the stress it places on the grid.

""Fossil fuels are both a root cause and exacerbating influence on these blackout events,"" the analysis reads. ""The extraction and burning of oil, gas, and coal are the primary drivers of climate change, while outdated fossil infrastructure accompanied by wild market volatility have made these fuel sources expensive and unreliable.""

But Turner argues that there are few rewards for the environment when grids switch over to wind and solar.

""The notion that they have baptized themselves as green is a joke,"" Turner said. ""They use more fossil fuels in the production, installation, and then the redundancies of wind and solar than if they just burn those fossil fuels directly to make electricity. So the idea that they’re green is just purely a lie.""

""It just amazes me that we look at this, we look at all the data, and politicians are still hell-bent on pushing renewable energy when it’s proven to be nothing but a failure,"" he added.

Turned said that the U.S. was already the cleanest country in the world before the push toward renewable energy sources.

CITADEL CEO SAYS ENERGY POLICY IN THE US AND EUROPE IS A ‘TRAIN WRECK’

""We all want clean air and clear water and a clean earth. No one does it better than the United States of America. By far we are the cleanest nation on Earth,"" Turner said, adding that the switch from reliable energy sources will ""plunge entire neighborhoods into darkness.""

He pointed to other examples of countries that have been ahead of the U.S. on switching to wind and solar such as Germany, arguing that people there have still yet to see any benefit from the transition.

""Germany pays the highest electricity price for the developed world. … they pay almost five times what we do for electricity,"" Turner said.

The move towards renewables has also caused Germany to be dependent on Russian natural gas to fill the void in their capacity, while the country has even begun to bring some coal plants back online. They have also resorted to buying energy from neighboring France, which produced over 80% of its electricity with nuclear power.

HANNITY: LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE AND EXPOSE THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE LIES

Turner believes nuclear could be a solution in the U.S. as well, but he notes that a move to more nuclear energy would receive plenty of pushback.

""Nuclear is absolutely one of the strongest solutions. Nuclear is absolutely a viable solution that has the smallest footprint,"" Turner said. ""The biggest problem nuclear has against it is there is a very aggressive and very effective fear campaign.""

Turner placed much of the blame for the current situation on the Biden administration, considering President Biden's renewal of the push to switch the country over to wind and solar.

But energy prices are now soaring as families already deal with decades-high inflation, leaving little hope for relief in the near future.

THIS IS AMERICAN ENERGY'S BIGGEST THREAT

""Natural gas right now is trading at probably more than three times what it should,"" Turner said. ""There are runs on natural gas, we have a huge shortage of it and the price is insane. Coal is probably four times what it should be, and these are all the results of Biden’s energy policies.""

The rush to convert to renewable energy has not been limited to Democratic administrations, with Republican-run Texas having outage issues amid a transition to wind power.

A winter storm last year caused widespread outages across Texas, with many of the windmills that failed being deliberately turned off, so they wouldn't freeze. The problem was exacerbated because the state lacked adequate backup from natural gas plants to keep the lights on in many communities.

""It’s bipartisan stupidity,"" Turner said. ""It was Republican governors of Texas who for years pushed renewable energy mandates. If that can happen in Texas, then we’re doomed as a country.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""There was no backup. Why? Because Republican governors bought into this lie that all we need is wind and we’ll be fine,"" Turner said.

Texas' vulnerability to outages has already started to show this year, with the state needing to dip into power reserves already this month amid a surge in demand.

Grid operators in Texas insist that they have the resources in reserve to power the state through the coming summer months, while Texas Oil & Gas Association President Todd Staples said the state ""has excess capacity available when plants are online and renewables are able to put power on the grid.""

But Turner is skeptical, arguing that policymakers should start pushing back against the ""green agenda.""

""It takes an awful lot of political courage to say ‘this is all just a load of nonsense, right?,’"" he said. ""These are failed technologies, very expensive technologies, made in Chinese slave camp technologies, and they’re not green, that’s the biggest lie.

""My question for the Biden administration or any other governors is, why do you continue to go down this path?""",https://www.foxnews.com
1034,Highland Park 4th of July shooting person of interest: Who is Robert Crimo?,Tyler O'Neil,"

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES AND VIDEO : Authorities have arrested the man suspected of opening fire at the Highland Park, Illinois, 4th of July parade shooting Monday, killing six and injuring 36 others. Authorities identified the suspect as 21-year-old Robert ""Bobby"" E. Crimo III.

""During the attack, Crimo was dressed in women's clothing,"" in order to ""conceal his facial tattoos and his identity,"" Christopher Covelli, a spokesperson for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, said at a news briefing Tuesday. Covelli said Crimo fired ""more than 70 rounds,"" then blended into the crowd. Covelli said there are no indications anyone else was involved in the shooting.

Authorities had not yet determined a motive for Crimo, Covelli added.

Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering told NBC's ""Today Show"" that she was Crimo's cub scout leader when he was a child, and said she is waiting for prosecutors to file charges against him for the shooting. She further said that the gun that was used in the shooting was obtained legally.

Paul Crimo, the suspected shooter's uncle, told Fox 32 that there were ""no warning signs"" suggesting that the young man would carry out the attack. The uncle also described his nephew as ""a real quiet kid.""

An FBI wanted poster describes Robert E. Crimo III as a thin White male with brown eyes and neck-length brown hair, weighing 120 pounds. The poster also describes his tattoos: ""four tally marks with a line through them on his right cheek, red roses and green leaves on his neck, and cursive script above his left eyebrow.""

Crimo is also known as ""Awake the Rapper.""

IMDB describes Crimo as a ""six foot Hip hop phenom"" born on Sept. 20, 2000. ""He's the middle child of three.""

Crimo began uploading his music to the internet at age 11, but first gained traction with his 2016 track ""By The Pond"" featuring Atlas, according to IMDB. His estimated net worth is ""$100 thousand.""

Crimo is the son of Bob Crimo, president at Bob's Pantry & Deli in Highland Park. According to his Facebook account, the father ran for Highland Park mayor in 2020.

The rapper released a cryptic track called ""Are You Awake"" on Oct. 15, 2021. The track appears to suggest that Crimo was planning a life-defining act beyond his ability to stop. The video includes drawings of a man aiming a rifle at another person.

The video also includes an image of a newspaper clipping about Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated President John F. Kennedy, and another image of a victim shot with blood spraying from the body.

""Like a sleepwalker, I am unable to stop and think,"" he says in the track. ""My actions will be valiant and my thought is unnecessary. I know what I have to do, I know what's in it, not only for me, but for everyone else.""

""There is no past or future, just the now,"" he adds. ""It is more abstract than I can ever imagine. I can feel the atmosphere pushing me in. It's unstoppable, like a wave pulling me under, I can't breathe without it.""

""I need to leave now, I need to just do it. It is my destiny, everything has led up to this,"" Crimo says. ""Nothing can stop me, not even myself. Is there such thing as free will, or has this been planned out, like a cosmic recipe?""

UKRAINIAN TROOPS HOLD BACK RUSSIA FROM TAKING PRIORITY CITY IN DONBAS

Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces were ""holding"" the ""defensive perimeters"" but reports Wednesday suggested Russia was continuing to make gradual gains in the brutally contested city of Sievierodonetsk.

If Russian forces are able to capture the city, this would give Moscow complete control over the Luhansk region and would allow it to more easily push its forces west into north Donetsk and potentially beyond.

The U.K.’s defense ministry said Wednesday that ""Russian ground operations remain tightly focused"" in Luhansk with significant firepower concentrated in the streets of Sievierodonetsk.

The ministry said Russian troops were ""pushing closer to the town center"" and assessed they had gained control over half of the city.

Sievierodonetsk has become the site of one of the most fierce ground assaults in Ukraine since the war began with the infamous Chechen fighters believed to have joined the fight there – prompting some to be concerned Ukraine could see a repeat of the brutality that was carried out in Mariupol.

Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the situation in eastern Ukraine was challenging because forces there lacked adequate weaponry.

""In the east, it is difficult for us because of the lack of appropriate weapons,"" he told reporters from Kyiv.

1038,Ethan Liming death: Suspect's attorney questions narrative of events in police affidavit,Stephanie Pagones,"

An attorney representing one of the three Ohio men accused of beating 17-year-old Ethan Liming to death is questioning the series of events that preceded and followed the fatal fight earlier this month.

Donovon Jones, 21, DeShawn Stafford Jr., 20, and Tyler Stafford, 19, remain behind bars in Summit County Jail, where they are being held on $1 million bond on charges related to Liming’s June 2 death. Just days after police documents obtained by Fox News Digital described how the Staffords ""took Liming’s car and drove it to the other end of the lot"" when Liming’s friends tried to take him to the hospital, one of the men’s attorneys is casting doubt upon the pair’s intentions when moving the vehicle.

Jonathan Sinn, who represents DeShawn ""Shawn"" Stafford, conceded that the suspects did take away the water bead gun and the car during the night’s events.

But they were not moving the car to prevent Liming from getting to the hospital, Sinn said. Instead, they did so to keep Liming and his friends on the scene until police arrived, Sinn said – despite that his client and the other suspects also allegedly fled.

""My understanding is it wasn't moved in an effort to try and prevent anyone from getting help,"" Sinn said. ""It was more of a situation of, 'You guys are going to stay here. You guys are gonna stay here until the cops come, you're going to have to explain the situation.’ So they didn't want the other boys taking off because they really felt they were in the right.""

""Our family is confident that when the facts of the case are presented in court, Ethan will get justice."" — Bill Liming, father of Ethan Liming

Police arrived at the scene that night to find ""nobody was on scene,"" Akron Police Chief Steve Mylett told reporters.

Sinn noted that he has received the narrative of events from Stafford's family. Earlier this week, he told the court Shawn Stafford was trying to defend himself after Shawn, his brother and his cousin saw ""a car-load of teenagers … with, what at the time seemed to be a fully automatic firearm.""

ETHAN LIMING MURDER: THREE ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO BRUTAL BEATING OF OHIO TEEN

The firearm in question was an orange and white SPLATRBALL water bead gun, police said.

Liming was an honors student at a public school in Akron, where he achieved a 4.03 GPA and played baseball and football, his father told Fox News Digital. He aspired to become a lawyer.

Liming’s father, Bill Liming, said in a statement on Tuesday that his family ""is confident that when the facts of the case are presented in court, Ethan will get justice.""

""People are going to say what they are going to say,"" he added.

Jones and the DeShawn and Tyler Stafford were each charged with murder and felonious assault, records show. Authorities also charged Jones with disrupting public service.

Each pleaded not guilty during Monday’s arraignment.

Sinn said none of the three men would be able to make bail, and added that his client had never met or spoken with Liming prior to June 2. He said his client was not injured by the water bead gun, but ""had his head split open"" during the fight.

Asked why his client did not turn himself in or go to the police sooner, he said Shawn was ""working with family to try and obtain counsel. He wanted to go with a lawyer.""

""My heart goes out to Ethan's family,"" Sinn said. ""But none of us know what happened that night. None of us were there. We're going to have to let the court system play out.""

LOOKING BACK AT WHAT AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID

Liming, 17, died after suffering blunt force trauma to his head on the night of June 2. Police said Liming was in a vehicle with friends as the group was ""riding around the surrounding area shooting a SPLATRBALL Water Bead Blaster at objects and possibly unsuspecting people.""

The group then pulled into the Promise School, a property that is supported in part by The Lebron James Family Foundation, and made its way toward the basketball court.

""The teens then appeared to have targeted or approached the subjects who were on the court and fired the gel soft gun at them,"" police said. ""The collective actions of the teens in the car appear to have unfortunately provoked the altercation.""

At least two of the people who were in the car with Liming exited the vehicle and fired the water bead gun at the crowd on the basketball court, cops said. They then allegedly ran back to the car, where both groups converged, and a fight broke out.

Meanwhile, affidavits related to the suspects’ arrests describe in sum and substance how the men were involved ""in an altercation with Liming"" and his three friends. They allegedly ""punched"" and ""assaulted"" each of the four victims, and ""beat Liming until he was unconscious."" They each ""then beat him more"" while ""he was unconscious on the ground,"" the affidavit states.

Rapper Lil Pump doubled down on his support of Donald Trump by attending the president’s campaign rally in Florida on Sunday.

The “Gucci Gang” rapper became notoriously pro-Trump after he took a look at Joe Biden’s tax plan and reasoned that he would end up paying more to the federal government under a Biden presidency due to his wealth.

Lil Pump posted two videos to his Instagram Story on Sunday showing that he was in the front row of the president’s recent rally in the swing state. The video opens with an excited-looking Lil Pump sporting a red “Make America Great Again” hat as he listens intently to Trump speak.

He then turns the camera to show the president at the podium during his rally before turning the camera back to himself to emit a gleeful laugh before ending the video. There's no one except what appears to be Secret Service agents between the rapper and the stage, implying he was given a front-row seat to the event.

In his speech, Trump criticized Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, lockdowns, and insisted the pandemic was ""rounding"" the turn.

Lil Pump’s public support for Trump began last week when the “Be Like Me” artist took to Instagram to share a photoshopped image of himself shaking hands with the president. He captioned the picture, “THE DAY I MET TRUMP #trump202022020.”

The parents of accused Highland Park, Illinois, shooter Robert ‘Bobby’ Crimo III were ""a problem"" and always the last to pick him up from his afterschool sports program, the suspect's former coach told Fox News Digital.

""I remember the parents more than him because they were kind of a problem,"" recalled Jeremy Cahnmann, who ran an afterschool sports program at Lincoln Elementary School. ""There wasn't a lot of love in that family.""

The accused shooter, 21, is in police custody after allegedly gunning down revelers at the Highland Park July 4 parade, killing at least six people and injuring more than 36.

Crimo was 9 or 10 when he was enrolled in Cahnmann's Nerf football program, along with his younger brother. ""Every week, the Crimos were the last kids there, and we'd have to call their parents to pick them up,"" the former coach said, speaking of Crimo's dad, Bob Crimo, 58, and his mom, Denise Pesina, 48.

Pesina, however, was a handful, he said. ""She got into it once with one of the heads of the program, she was yelling,"" he recalled. ""It seemed like her kids were a nuisance to her.""

The accused shooter, an aspiring rapper, grew up with his parents, younger brother and older sister on McDaniels Avenue in Highland Park, outside of Chicago.

Under the stage name ""Awake the Rapper,"" Crimo posted a disturbing music video in 2021 that featured drawings of a stick figure wearing tactical gear carrying out an attack with a rifle, and a newspaper clipping about Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated John F. Kennedy.

""The signs were there for a long time,"" said a neighbor of Crimo. ""There were always police cars at the house. The parents were arguing, fighting all the time.""

""He was so nice, he always gave the kids free candy and treats,"" the neighbor said.

The mom seemed unstable while the father was well liked in the community, locals told Fox News Digital.

At the time of the shooting, the younger Crimo was living with his father and uncle at a home in nearby Highwood. Neighbors said Pesina still lived in the Highland Park home, which had become an eyesore in the upscale suburb.

""I walk by the house every day, it looks like it should be condemned,"" said a local. ""The landscaping is seven-feet high. I was thinking to myself the other day, we should really do a welfare check.""

1043,New York approves gun law requiring buyers to provide social media handles,Landon Mion,"

New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a new gun control bill Friday after the Supreme Court ruled last week that the state's rules that make it difficult for residents to obtain a concealed carry permit were unconstitutional.

The latest legislation was signed into law shortly after New York's Democratic-controlled Legislature passed the proposal. Hochul had called the Legislature back to Albany on Thursday for an ""extraordinary session"" to work on the bill in response to the high court's decision.

The law struck down by the Supreme Court stated that gun owners would have to demonstrate ""proper cause"" to receive a concealed carry license.

The new law will require people trying to purchase a handgun license to hand over a list of social media accounts they have maintained over the last three years, so officials can verify their ""character and conduct.""

SUPREME COURT GUN DECISION SHOOTA DOWN NY RULE THAT SET HIGH BAR FOR CONCEALED CARRY LICENSES

According to the measure, applicants must prove they have ""the essential character, temperament and judgment necessary to be entrusted with a weapon and to use it only in a manner that does not endanger oneself and others.""

""Sometimes, they’re telegraphing their intent to cause harm to others,"" Hochul said at a news conference.

Individuals applying for a license to carry a handgun will also be required to provide four character references and take 16 hours of gun safety training and two hours of shooting practice at a range. They will be subject to periodic background checks and will have to turn over social media accounts and contact information for adults living in their household.

EX-BOYFRIEND OF NEW YORK CITY WOMAN SHOT DEAD WHILE PUSHING STROLLER ARRESTED

Licenses will have to be renewed after three years and an appeals process will be established, the law notes.

Under the law, concealed weapons will be prohibited from a number of areas, including Times Square, subways, buses, bars, government buildings, churches, schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks and homeless shelters.

Firearms will also be barred from private establishments unless business owners explicitly state that they are allowed. Businesses must post a sign granting permission to armed patrons. In many other states, businesses that do not permit guns typically have to post signs indicating that firearms are not allowed.

Friday's bill altered a recently passed law that banned the sale of certain bulletproof vests, although that legislation had failed to cover the type of protection worn by the 18-year-old gunman who fatally shot 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo in May.

1044,Multiple Texas counties to declare border crisis an ‘invasion’ as numbers increase,Adam Shaw,"

Multiple Texas counties on Tuesday will declare that the migrant crisis at the southern border is an ""invasion,"" Fox News has learned, a move that could lead to similar declarations across the state.

Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan is expected to announce the move at a news conference Tuesday afternoon, along with a number of other officials from other counties who will join him.

Kinney County Attorney Brent Smith told Fox News Digital that he believes approximately 12 to15 counties could end up having declared an invasion by the end of the month.

With migrant numbers hitting historic levels, and with more than 239,000 migrant encounters in May alone, there has been considerable talk in conservative circles about the merits of declaring the crisis an ""invasion"" -- which could open up a number of potential legal avenues for states.

They have pointed to language in Article I of the Constitution, which allows for States to ""engage in War"" when it has been ""actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay"" without the approval of Congress. They also note Article IV says the U.S. ""shall protect each [state] against invasion.""

The idea scored a major win in February, when Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich issued a legal opinion declaring the crisis an invasion, arguing that the definition of ""invasion"" contained under the U.S. Constitution is not limited to hostile foreign states, and can include ""hostile non-state actors.""

REPUBLICANS, HAWKS FEAR BORDER CRISIS WILL GET WORSE AFTER SCOTUS ‘REMAIN-IN-MEXICO’ RULING

""The violence and lawlessness at the border caused by transnational cartels and gangs satisfies the definition of an ‘invasion’ under the U.S. Constitution, and Arizona therefore has the power to defend itself from this invasion under the Governor’s authority as Commander-in-Chief,"" Brnovich wrote. ""An actual invasion permits the State to engage in defensive actions within its own territory at or near its border.""

Cuccinelli told Fox News Digital that the move by the Texas counties was significant and should now put more pressure on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to make the declaration himself.

""The key here is you've got the first legal ruling that the southern border situation is an invasion,"" he said. "" One, that's obviously very significant, and two it's going to -- as it should -- put enormous pressure on Governor Abbott to adopt that position themselves and to respond accordingly.""

Kinney County itself is a rural county and officials there have estimated that they have seen thousands of illegal immigrants crossing through the county in recent weeks.

Kinney County Attorney Smith told Fox News Digital that he saw the move as standing with Gov. Abbott in taking unprecedented action against what he believes is a failure by the Biden administration to take appropriate action at the federal level.

""Last week Governor Abbott was in Eagle Pass and he said something to the effect of unprecedented times calls for unprecedented action or measures. And the counties that have declared an invasion agree with Governor Abbott that these are unprecedented times where local and state governments have to work together and take unprecedented action,"" he said.

""And the only reason we have to do this is because President Biden has failed to secure the border at all. So we're standing with the governor and we're declaring an invasion in the hope that he will stand with us in doing so,"" he said.

The move comes after the state was dealt a defeat at the Supreme Court last week when the high court ruled against Texas, finding that the Biden administration could unravel the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)",https://www.foxnews.com
1045,"McDonald's responds to 20-year-old burger, says it's 'by no means the same as the day it was purchased'",Michael Hollan,"

As it turns out, there’s likely nothing unusual going on with that 20-year-old McDonald’s burger that hasn't started to rot.

Last week, David Whipple of Utah revealed that an old hamburger he purchased from the fast-food chain hadn't decomposed, despite the fact that he bought it in 1999. But according to a professor of food science at Rutgers, it’s possible for this sort of preservation to occur under the right conditions.

McDonald's was the first to respond to news of Whipple's burger, telling Fox News that despite looking fine, the burger had definitely undergone some changes.

“In the right environment, our burgers, like most other foods, could decompose,” said Anne Christensen, Director of Field Brand Reputation for McDonald’s. “But, in order to decompose, you need certain conditions — specifically moisture.”

She continued: “Without sufficient moisture – either in the food itself or the environment – bacteria and mold may not grow and therefore, decomposition is unlikely. So if food is or becomes dry enough, it is unlikely to grow mold or bacteria or decompose. Food prepared at home that is left to dehydrate could see similar results. Similarly, this particular burger is likely dried out and dehydrated, and by no means the same as the day it was purchased.”

TACO BELL THIEF BREAKS INTO RESTAURANT, COOKS MEAL, THEN TAKES NAP

Donald W. Schaffner, Ph. D., distinguished professor and extension specialist for the Food Science graduate program at Rutgers University, told Fox News that the explanation provided by McDonald’s was an “entirely factual response.”

“I would’ve said the same thing,” he explained, but stipulated that there’s still a lot of information we don’t know about how the burger was stored in the years after it was initially bought. Under the right conditions, however, it’s possible that any burger, not just a fast-food burger, could be preserved like this.

Professor Schaffner explained that since McDonald’s cooks their burgers well-done, that would likely dry the burger out and kill off many (but not all) of the micro-organisms that would cause decomposition. Also, Utah typically has a very arid environment, so it’s entirely possible that the burger dehydrated before the bacteria could do its job, he said.

In other words, the burger itself has somewhat been mummified.

“If you were to rehydrate that burger somehow,” he explained, “the micro-organisms could start the dehydration process.”

""The other option I thought of was try to appeal to somebody’s humanity, and I just remember yelling out that I have kids, and it seemed to work.

1049,Trump pressures Pence ahead of Electoral College certification: ‘This is a time for extreme courage’,Brooke Singman,"

President Trump put pressure on Vice President Mike Pence ahead of Wednesday’s joint session of Congress to certify the results of the 2020 election, claiming that if Pence ""comes through for us,"" the Trump-Pence ticket would ""win the presidency.""

""States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval,"" the president tweeted hours before the proceedings were set to begin in Congress. ""All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!""

ELECTORAL COLLEGE OBJECTIONS IN CONGRESS: WHAT TO KNOW

Trump also tweeted earlier on Wednesday: ""If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency,"" Trump tweeted. ""Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be).""

Trump added: ""Mike can send it back!""

Trump’s tweet put renewed pressure on the vice president who will preside over Wednesday’s joint session of Congress to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.

Trump, on Tuesday night, said that he and Pence ""are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.""

The president said that the election was ""corrupt in contested states, and in particular it was not in accordance with the Constitution in that they made large scale changes to election rules and regulations as dictated by local judges and politicians, not by state legislators.""

TRUMP SAYS HE, PENCE IN 'TOTAL AGREEMENT' THAT VP HAS 'POWER' TO BLOCK CERTIFICATION OF ELECTION RESULTS

""This means that it was illegal,"" Trump said.

Trump went on to say that Pence has ""several options under the U.S. Constitution.""

""He can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification,"" Trump said. ""He can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the House of Representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation.""

A spokesman for Pence declined to comment.

Trump’s statement came after The New York Times reported that Pence, during a conversation with Trump, told him that he had no power to block the certification of the election results on Wednesday.

The president, on On Tuesday morning, the president insisted that Pence has the power to overturn the election results.

""The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,"" the president tweeted on Tuesday morning.

And Monday night, at an election eve rally in Georgia for the two GOP senators running in the state’s twin U.S. Senate runoff contests, Trump told the large crowd of supporters, ""I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you.""

TRUMP SLAMS MCCONNELL, THUNE, CORNYN AS 'WEAK,' 'INEFFECTIVE' RINOS AHEAD OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION

""I hope that our great vice president – our great vice president, comes through for us. He's a great guy. Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him as much,"" Trump emphasized.

But White House officials told Fox News on Tuesday that Pence will ""follow the law,"" saying that Pence is ""taking a very diligent and studious approach to his job tomorrow.""

""He has consulted at length with staff. He has gone through the Electoral Count Act several times,"" an official said. ""He has read legal opinions, met with the Senate parliamentarian and consulted with outside experts on the subject matter.""

But those officials add that ""the vice president will follow the law. He will act tomorrow with fidelity to the law and the Constitution.""

Meanwhile, more than a dozen Senate Republicans have said they will object to the certification of the presidential election results in at least one state, and more than 100 House Republican members said they plan to object to results in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia.

But Republicans, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas, Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tim Scott of South Carolina, among others, have committed to voting to certify the election results.

Trump's renewed pressure on Pence comes as he has repeatedly charged for two months that the presidential election was ""rigged"" and has claimed that there was ""massive voter fraud"" in a handful of battleground states where Biden narrowly edged the president, to score a 306-232 Electoral College victory over the GOP incumbent.

The Trump campaign has launched a number of legal challenges, while Trump himself has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Joe Biden’s victories.

While the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down.

Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press last month that ""to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.""",https://www.foxnews.com

Scare them away from using this drug as young people. But I'll tell you, the pot industry is extremely well funded, and it's even protected by some high-place Republicans. Remember, former House Speaker John Boehner saw a quick buck to be made and joined an advisory board of a big pot company after being against legalizing pot. … So Big Weed uses its well-paid, pot-pushing media allies and social media influencers to trash anyone who questions the mad rush to legalization. … I don't care, because they're pushing pot on our kids. We're pushing for answers and accountability. These are the eyes of some of the mass killers who've reportedly been regular pot users. Look at them. Those in politics and in the media who devote their time and energy to fearmongering on fake issues while covering up the truth about the growing scourge of violent psychosis in our young people.

Gendron wrote in the manifesto that he identifies as a White Supremacist, stating that he fears White people are in the process of being replaced by people of other races.

Eleven of the victims in the attack are Black and two of them are White, according to authorities.

Gendron was charged with first-degree murder and pleaded not guilty in front of a judge on Saturday evening.

Saturday, May 14

Officials say that the 18-year-old exited his car at the Tops Friendly Market on the 1200 block of Jefferson Avenue in Buffalo, New York, and allegedly began his racist attack on the grocery store which is in a predominately Black neighborhood in the city.

Police said that the individual was heavily armed and live-streamed his attack on a social media platform, which was later revealed as Twitch. A spokesperson for the company told Fox News that the video was taken down two minutes after the violence began.

During a press conference after the shooting, officials said that a total of 13 people were shot, adding that 10 people were killed. Eleven of the victims in the attack are Black and two of them are White, according to authorities.

Among the people killed are a retired Buffalo police officer, who was a security guard and fired multiple shots at the gunman but hit his bulletproof vest.

After killing the security guard, the shooter went through the store and shot other people, Gramaglia said.

Three people were killed in the parking lot of the grocery store, according to Gramaglia.

Gendron used a rifle that was purchased legally but contained magazines for ammunition that are banned from being sold in New York.

On Saturday evening, Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Saturday night that the Department of Justice is investigating the Buffalo mass shooting as a ""hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism.""

""The Justice Department is investigating this matter as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism. The Justice Department is committed to conducting a thorough and expeditious investigation into this shooting and to seeking justice for these innocent victims,"" Garland said in a statement.

""Tonight, the country mourns the victims of a senseless, horrific shooting in Buffalo, New York. The FBI and ATF are working closely with the Buffalo Police Department and federal, state, and local law enforcement partners,"" he added.

Sunday, May 15

Authorities said on Sunday that the 18-year-old suspect likely planned out the attack for months and pointed to the roughly 180-page manifesto that was posted by the alleged shooter before the attack.

During a press conference on Sunday, Gramaglia said that the families of the 10 victims from the attack were notified.

""Last night, we completed the process with the medical examiner's office and identifications,"" said Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia. ""More importantly, we had a family reunification center and we were able to provide all those notifications so that they can begin the grieving process.""

He added that based on the evidence thus far, the attack is an ""absolute racist hate crime.""

""The evidence that we have uncovered so far makes no mistake that this is an absolute racist hate crime.""

""It will be prosecuted as a hate crime,"" he says. ""This is someone who has hate in their hearts ... And there is no mistake that that's the direction that this is going in. This will be completely geared toward securing a conviction for this individual.""

Gramaglia also said that investigators are gathering search warrants to be executed on Gendron's home, his vehicle, his social media activity, digital footprint and technology, including telephones and a computer.

The Buffalo police commissioner also revealed that the suspect went through a mental health evaluation after allegedly making ""threatening statements"" in June 2021.

""That individual was brought in for a mental health evaluation,"" Gramaglia said. ""He was evaluated and then he was released. As far as when we say 'On the radar,' there was nothing picked up on the state police intelligence, nothing that was picked up on the FBI intelligence. Nobody called in. Nobody called any complaints.""

Gramaglia said that three weapons were found at the scene of the attack, stating there were three weapons. There were two in the car and one in his possession…""One was a rifle, one was a shotgun ... He had an AR-15.""

Erie County Sheriff John C. Garcia said on Sunday that the 18-year-old suspect is being held on suicide watch.

Among the deceased is retired police officer Aaron Salter Jr. and Ruth Whitfield, who is the 86-year-old mother of Garnell Whitfield, who is a retired Buffalo fire commissioner.

Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said that Salter is a ""hero in our eyes"" on Saturday.

""There could have been more victims if not for his actions,"" Gramaglia said.

Whitfield was returning from a trip to visit her husband who is currently in a nursing home when she went into the grocery store.

Whitfield's son described her as ""a mother to the motherless"" and ""a blessing to all of us.""

""She inspired me to be a man of God, and to do whatever I do the best I could do. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without her,"" he said.

The Buffalo Police Department released a full list of victims on Sunday night who died or were hurt in the attack:

House Judiciary Committee Member Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sounded off Tuesday on news that the Internal Revenue Service, Railroad Retirement Board and other federal agencies have been stocking up on thousands of rounds of ammunition as civilians face shortages and President Biden continues to claim no one needs such volumes of bullets.

MATT GAETZ: Call me old-fashioned, but I thought the heaviest artillery an IRS agent would need would be a calculator. I imagine the IRS in green eyeshades and cubicles — not busting doors down and emptying Glock clips on our fellow Americans. Certainly it's troubling that in 2022 alone, the IRS has spent around $725,000 on ammunition. So here's the Biden plan: Disarm Americans, open the border, empty the prisons — but rest assured, they'll still collect your taxes, and they need $725,000 worth of ammunition, apparently, to get the job done.

GAS TAX HOLIDAY ‘TRICKS THE MARKET,' DOMESTIC SPECULATION AN EASIER FIX: SEN. SCOTT

""Tax cheat"" isn't usually a term we hear alongside ""armed and dangerous."" And there was a report that showed over a 10-year period, the IRS actually stockpiled $11 million worth of ammunition.

FORMER DEM LAWMAKER: ATTACKING BIDEN STRICTLY OVER AGE, ACUITY WON'T WORK

Undeniably, part of the strategy is that with one hand, the Biden regime is doing everything they can to suppress access to ammunition for regular Americans, while with the other hand, they are scooping up all the ammo that they can possibly find.

1062,California proposes curriculum with chanting name of Aztec god who accepts human sacrifice,Sam Dorman,"

The California Department of Education has proposed an ethnic studies ""model curriculum"" that includes, among other things, chanting the names of Aztec gods in an attempt to build unity among schoolchildren.

Included in the draft curriculum is a list of ""lesson resources"" with a chant based on ""In Lak Ech,"" which it describes as ""love, unity, mutual respect,"" and ""Panche Be,"" which it describes as ""seeking the roots of truth.""

The chant starts with a declaration that ""you are my other me"" and ""if I do harm to you, I do harm to myself."" Before chanting the name of the Aztec god Tezkatlipoka, the text reads: ""Seeking the roots of the truth, seeking the truth of the roots, elders and us youth, (youth), critical thinking through.""

It adds: ""Tezkatlipoka, Tezkatlipoka, x2 smoking mirror, self-reflection Tezkatlipoka.""

MANHATTAN PRIVATE SCHOOL WARNS AGAINST USING 'MOM AND DAD' IN 'INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE' GUIDE

Tezkatlipoka is the name of an Aztec god that was honored with human sacrifice. According to the World History Encyclopedia, an impersonator of Tezkatlipoka would be sacrificed with his heart removed to honor the deity.

In Aztec mythology, Tezkatlipoka is the brother of Quetzalcoatl, Huizilopochtli and Xipe Totec -- all of whom appear to be invoked in the proposed chant.

A portion read, ""pulsating creation huitzilopochtli cause like sunlight, the light inside of us, in will to action’s what brings... Xipe Totek, Xipe Totek, x2 transformation, liberation, education, emancipation. imagination revitalization, liberation, transformation, decolonization, liberation, education, emancipation, changin’ our situation in this human transformation.""

A linked video showed what appeared to be students engaging in a unity chant with some of the language described.

Another chant used the term ""Hunab Ku,"" or ""One-God,"" which Encyclopedia Brittanica identified as a Mayan deity.

That portion of the chant read: ""we’re here to transform the world we’re spiraling, rotating & revolving in, giving thanks daily, tlazokamati, giving thanks daily, tlazokamati, healing & transforming as we’re evolving in this universe, universe, of Hunab Ku, Hunab Ku, x2 Nahui OlIin Lak Ech - Panche Beh, Ethnic Studies For All, Represent!!""

OREGON PROMOTES TEACHER PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO UNDO 'RACISM IN MATHEMATICS'

According to CDE's website, the school board is supposed to review a draft of the curriculum on March 17-18. CDE did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Reported by Discovery Institute researcher Chris Rufo, the curriculum was just one of many diversity programs to gain attention in recent months. Much of its language and content bears resemblance to other programs that have been associated with critical race theory -- a controversial way of analyzing identity that has been the subject of intense debate.

The California curriculum's introduction argued that the program would help marginalized groups.

""By affirming the identities and contributions of marginalized groups in our society, ethnic studies helps students see themselves and each other as part of the narrative of the United States,"" it read. ""Importantly, this helps students see themselves as active agents in the interethnic bridge-building process we call American life.""

TEACHERS AT POSH NYC SCHOOL RELEASE 8-PAGE ANTI-RACISM MANIFESTO, SPARK UPROAR: REPORT

The guiding principles included goals including, ""celebrate and honor Native People/s of the land and communities of Black Indigenous People of Color."" Another guiding principle read: ""Center and place high value on the pre-colonial, ancestral knowledge, narratives, and communal experiences of Native people/s and people of color and groups that are typically marginalized in society.""

The field of ethnic studies, it claimed, ""critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of oppression that continue to have social, emotional, cultural, economic, and political impacts.""

The above chants were part of a list of instructional resources for educators to use in order to facilitate discussions about ""race, racism, bigotry, and the experiences of diverse Americans.""

The ""chants, affirmations, and energizers,"" the curriculum read, ""can be used as energizers to bring the class together, build unity around ethnic studies principles and values, and to reinvigorate the class following a lesson that may be emotionally taxing or even when student engagement may appear to be low.""

While some have praised these types of programs as a way to enhance racial understanding, others have been more critical.

Williamson Evers, an Independent Institute senior fellow and former assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Education, told Fox News that California's curriculum furthered a ""neo-racist ideology.""

About half of the city's shootings have occurred in 10 neighborhoods – five in the Bronx, four in Brooklyn and one in Queens, officials said.

Crime is up in early every category except murder, according to police data.

As of Sunday, the city experienced 96 killings, compared to 105 in the same time frame in 2021. Rapes were up from 354 in 2021 to 410 in the same time period. Robberies, assaults, burglaries and vehicle thefts were all up as well.

The NYPD reported 332 shooting victims, a 14.5% increase compared to the same period in 2021 when 190 people were shot. Officials blamed much of the violence on repeat offenders, some of whom have several arrests.

""The rising recidivism in New York City is up substantially from 2019,"" said Michael Lipetri, chief of the NYPD's Crime Control Strategies. ""The data is clear and simple. Individuals that continue to get arrested multiple times continue and continue to commit these crimes.""

Overall, the NYPD reported 29,608 crimes to the 20,543 reported in the same period of 2021.

The newly formed Neighborhood Safety Unit, which is tasked with getting guns off the street and reducing street crime, has made 135 arrests, of which 25 were related to guns, since the first of several teams began operations on March 14, said Chief of Department Ken Corey.

Of the gun arrests, four were juveniles, five had open felony cases and seven had prior felony convictions, he said. Of the total number of arrests, 91 had a prior arrest record, 57 have prior felony arrests and 21 were on parole or probation.

The parents of Highland Park Fourth of July shooting suspect Robert ""Bobby"" Crimo III had a long list of encounters with law enforcement — involving many domestic disputes, bizarre complaints and allegations of other men pursuing the mother romantically, Illinois police records show.

Before their son was accused of opening fire on an Independence Day celebration Monday, killing at least seven and wounding dozens more, Highland Park police had 51 pages of incident reports related to their home.

The couple often traded barbs and called police on one another as their son was growing up, the documents show. Denise Pesina, his mother, told officers her husband ""threatens to call police for any and every argument we get in. He wants the police to think I’m crazy.""

The father, Robert ""Bob"" Crimo Jr., once wrote in a witness statement that he wanted a police report explaining that his wife ""was not feeling well from her hormones being out of line.""

He also complained she ""clotheslined"" his dresser and knocked his belongings to the floor before removing the lock on the bedroom door.

He left the screwdriver out of his written statement, and prosecutors ultimately declined charges.

They called police on each other frequently, often to report issues including verbal arguments, midday intoxication and unwanted encounters with neighbors at their suburban home outside Chicago. One call came simply to report roadkill on their street.

The documents appear to support the accounts of former neighbors and Crimo III's onetime coach, who told Fox News Digital Tuesday that the parents had issues and police were often seen outside the family home.

""I remember the parents more than him because they were kind of a problem,"" recalled Jeremy Cahnmann, who ran an afterschool sports program at Lincoln Elementary School. ""There wasn't a lot of love in that family.""

On several occasions, police asked the elder Crimo to leave the home for the night, or he left voluntarily. One incident report indicates they arrested him at least once, on Dec. 29, 2010.

One night in November 2011, Crimo called police on his neighbor, who he said ""stopped by his house to give his wife…a bottle of wine."" A few days later, Pesina called police because ""she felt uncomfortable exiting her vehicle due to romantic interest that William Hollander has shown her in the past.""

The reports also mention a man who told police he was Pesina’s ""boyfriend."" David Daniels was also identified as a former roommate who on at least one occasion was driven by police from the home to a Starbucks following a domestic violence call in which an unspecified male caller told police a woman bit him and caused bleeding.

Daniels called police to the Crimo home at least twice, in one case telling police he ""thinks his girlfriend was hit by husband, possibly, earlier.""

Pesina told police on multiple occasions that Daniels is ""mentally ill"" and disputed his claims.

Officers on multiple occasions gave the couple domestic violence packets and encouraged them to either seek counseling or split up.

The Crimo parents’ legal troubles extended beyond domestic calls. Both have numerous traffic offenses, including a 2012 DUI against Pesina and a 2002 child welfare case that got her a year of probation.

1069,"Elon Musk, Twitter users mock Biden for reading ‘End of Quote’ from teleprompter during live address",Gabriel Hays,"

Twitter users, including Elon Musk and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., berated President Biden on the social media platform Friday for yet another gaffe made by the world leader.

On Friday, Biden signed an executive order to provide limited protections to women seeking abortions in response to the reversal of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court on June 24th.

Flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Biden addressed the country and the press to explain his order, as well as express his commitment to protect a woman’s right to an abortion.

During the speech, however, Biden appeared unaware as to what and what not to read out loud from the teleprompter. In a moment that many Twitter users found highly amusing, Biden read a quote from the teleprompter and then read what appeared to be stage directions. He stated, ""It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who registered to vote and cast a ballot is consistently higher than the percentage of the men who do so. End of quote.""

BIDEN SAYS SCOTUS, GOP DO NOT 'HAVE A CLUE' ABOUT THE 'POWER OF AMERICAN WOMEN, BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT'

He then read the next set of directions out loud. ""Repeat the line,"" Biden said, before reciting the quote again and continuing to the next part of the address like nothing happened.

Washington Times columnist Tim Young mocked the president, tweeting, ""Biden is so far gone that he will literally read anything put on the teleprompter in front of him. ‘End of quote’ ...’Repeat the line.’""

Independent journalist Tim Pool thought the gaffe was hilarious, tweeting, ""Hahahahahahahahahaha.""

Conservative author John Cardillo called Biden ""Completely dysfunctional,"" adding, ""Has no idea what the words he’s reading mean.""

""The man is literally Ron Burgundy,"" tweeted conservative pundit Lauren Chen, referencing the ""Anchorman"" character played by Will Ferrell who did read everything put on his teleprompter in the 2004 film.

Conservative vlogger Luke Rudkowski expressed shock that the President of the United States was making gaffes like this. He tweeted, ""This is the commander and chief.""

""Please run for re-election,"" urged Congressman Byron Donalds, R-Fla.

1070,Japan's Shinzo Abe assassination: Who is suspect Tetsuya Yamagami?,Greg Norman,"

The 41-year-old suspect in the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reportedly has told police Friday that he was dissatisfied with the ex-leader and wanted to kill him, but not over his political beliefs.

Tetsuya Yamagami, who hails from Nara – where the 67-year-old Abe was gunned down while making a speech – is currently facing an attempted murder charge. But local police are expected to upgrade the charge to murder, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK.

""Former Prime Minister Abe was giving a speech normally, but a man came from behind. The first shot heard only a very loud sound and the person did not fall down. However, the moment the second shot was shot, former Prime Minister Abe collapsed,"" a witness told NHK. ""The [suspect] didn't seem to run away, he stayed there and the gun was there.""

The killing has sent shockwaves around the world and throughout Japan, a country with notoriously strict gun ownership laws.

FORMER JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE ASSASSINATED DURING CAMPAIGN SPEECH

Police said Yamagami was responding calmly to questions and had admitted to attacking Abe, telling investigators he had plotted to kill him because he believed rumors about the former leader's connection to a certain organization that police did not identify.

Ministry of Defense officials that spoke to NHK said the gun used in Abe’s assassination appears to have been homemade and the suspect, Yamagami, spent three years serving in the country’s Maritime Self-Defense Force between 2002 and 2005.

SHINZO ABE DEAD: JAPAN'S LONGEST-SERVING PRIME MINISTER WAS CONSERVATIVE KINGMAKER WHO STRENGTHENED US TIES

""The weapon used by Abe's assailant made a noise that could be compared to an explosion, and white smoke rose into the air after it was discharged. A gunpowder-like smell could be detected afterward,"" read a report Friday by the Kyodo News, which added that one of their journalists on-scene said the weapon appeared to have been held together with duct tape.

Abe was struck about two minutes and 20 seconds into his speech, according to NHK.

He then takes something out of a bag he was carrying and walks slowly toward Abe, coming several yards away from him, before raising the gun and opening fire, the station added.

Police also they confiscated similar weapons and his personal computer.

1071,Oregon Department of Education paying $1.9 million to train teachers against Western values of 'individualism',Hannah Grossman,"

Oregon's Department of Education allocated nearly $2 million for a fellowship that would train K-12 educators from diverse backgrounds to reject the ""eurocentric worldview"" of ""individualism,"" Fox News Digital has learned.

The antiracist fellowship, funded by ODE, is broken down into several arcs for ""decentering."" One of them is pushing back against the ""euro-centric worldview"" on ""individualism.""

""We are more than our titles and more than the roles we’ve been assigned; this arc will create space for each fellow to identify and unpack their multiple identities of self,"" the arc stated.

Another arc focused on ""unlearning;"" fellows will learn to ""practice understanding themselves as a grounded bridge between curriculum and their students."" This arc will also focus on ""unlearn[ing] harmful practices that deny self, story, relationship, and context.""

The total cost for the 23-month project will be $1,929,637.50. The fellowship will teach at most 600 educators how to create ""racially affirming environments"" in their classrooms. Affirming means that the teachers' identities are ""seen"" and ""honored"" in classrooms, ODE told Fox News Digital.

The fellowship will ""deepen educators' understanding… of the individual, the institutional and the systemic impacts of racism on schools and communities."" Fellows will create their own project ""that disrupts a racist pattern/practice/policy, or works towards liberation/equity/decolonization.""

1072,"CBP finds 'no evidence' Border Patrol agents whipped Haitian migrants, but still seeks to discipline them",Adam Shaw,"

The head of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Friday said there was ""no evidence"" that Border Patrol struck Haitian migrants with their reins or used whips in Del Rio, Texas, last year, implicitly rebuking the false claim made by President Biden and other top Democrats — even as the agency recommended punishment for the agents for infractions such as ""offensive"" language and unnecessary force.

""[DHS' Office of Professional Responsibility] found no evidence Border Patrol agents involved in this incident struck anyone with their reins intentionally or otherwise,"" CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said at a press conference, in which he also said that agents were not carrying whips.

Agents have been under investigation since Sept. 20, the day after agents on horseback dealt with migrants coming across the river in Del Rio. The incident made headlines as reporters and lawmakers saw the reins the agents were using and misinterpreted them as whips. It was a claim quickly debunked, but repeated by the President days later.

""To see people treated like they did, horses barely running over, people being strapped — it's outrageous,"" Biden told reporters, making a whipping motion with his hand. ""I promise you, those people will pay. There will be an investigation underway now and there will be consequences. There will be consequences.""

BORDER PATROL AGENTS FUME AS DHS PREPARES TO PUNISH OFFICERS CAUGHT UP IN ‘WHIP’ CONTROVERSY: ‘BULL----’

While the core complaint against the agents was found to be false, the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility found multiple infractions, but ones that were a far cry from Biden's claim that migrants were whipped. Magnus said that an agent was found to have used ""denigrating and offensive"" language against migrants regarding national origin and gender, and was accused of having maneuvered a horse around a child in an ""unsafe manner.""

The report also faults agents for using an ""unmoderated"" tactical radio, of having insufficient training for the situation, and for an ""unnecessary use of force"" to drive the migrants back.

Magnus did not say what the recommended punishment for the agents will be. But multiple federal sources had told Fox News that CBP’s proposals include suspensions of up to 14 days for the agents who were on horseback when they were involved in the incident. Magnus claimed that the report showed ""failures to make good decisions at multiple levels.""

The controversy began when agents were dispatched to deal with the Haitian migrant crisis near a river in Del Rio in September last year, where more than 10,000 migrants were camped under a bridge.

As migrants tried to enter the U.S. across the river from Mexico, agents stopped them. Images soon circulated on Twitter of the agents trying to block migrants from entering the U.S., and in one case grabbing a migrant’s shirt.

However, the images caused a firestorm when media outlets and Democratic lawmakers misidentified the agents’ split reins, which they use and twirl to control and direct the horse — and falsely claimed the agents were using ""whips"" on the migrants.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned what she described as ""the inappropriate use of what appear to be whips by Border Patrol officers on horseback to intimidate migrants."" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer decried ""images of inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants by Border Patrol — including the use of whips.""

However, the photographer who took the images said that he didn’t see anyone being whipped. But that didn’t stop both Vice President Harris and President Biden from promoting the claims — which infuriated Border Patrol agents who bristled at the false claims and what they saw as influencing the investigation.

CBP PROPOSES DISCIPLINE FOR TEXAS AGENTS ACCUSED OF ‘WHIPPING' HAITIAN MIGRANTS

""The moment he made that statement, the moment he said that those agents would pay, the moment he convicted those agents without any evidence, without any investigation, there could be no doubt in anybody's mind that these investigators were going to come back with some sort of charge against the agents,"" National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told Fox News Digital in June. ""They had no choice.""

""The president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, said that they would pay, and now they're paying,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas initially backed the agents, noting the use of reins to control the horse, but soon changed his stance, calling the images shocking and launching an investigation. The agents were shifted to desk duty and have remained there since.

Mayorkas promised the investigation would take ""days, not weeks"" but the investigation dragged on for months. The Office for Inspector General did not recommend criminal charges and the matter was passed to the Office of Professional Responsibility to look for administrative charges. Magnus on Friday bemoaned how long the investigation took to complete.

On Friday, Republicans slammed the conclusions by CBP, with Rep. John Katko, the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, calling them ""nothing more than a desperate attempt by the Biden administration to justify their initial knee-jerk rush to judgment that these Border Patrol agents were guilty of criminal conduct.

""Thus, they set out on a mission to save face and make an example out of these Border Patrol agents, who were only attempting to manage the untenable humanitarian and security crisis President Biden handed down to them,"" he said. ""As part of its justification, this insufficient report from DHS cites the negative impact that ‘significant media attention’ had on the department as the rationale for punishment. Let’s be clear: negative media attention, much of which was brought on by statements coming from those within the Biden administration itself, is not justification for vilifying these agents who have committed their lives in service to this nation’s homeland security.

""Months ago, these agents were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by DHS’ Office of the Inspector General and the [OPR] through investigations,"" he said. ""Border Patrol agents are leaving in record numbers and experiencing devastating impacts on their mental health as a result of the Biden Border Crisis. This is not what they signed up for. Our Border Patrol agents deserve better than this. Full stop.""

1073,"Brittney Griner pleads guilty in Russia, but experts warn next steps may have serious consequences",Paulina Dedaj,"

Brittney Griner pleaded guilty to a drug-smuggling charge on Thursday after months of being held in Russian detention – and now, experts say gaining her release in a potential prison swap could turn out to be a complex process with serious implications.

During her appearance in court, Griner maintained that her ""intent"" was not to violate Russian law. She could face up to 10 years in prison.

""I'd like to plead guilty, your honor. But there was no intent. I didn't want to break the law,"" she said, adding that she will give her testimony at a later date.

A verdict has not been ruled in her case but talks of a prisoner swap for Griner, who the State Department has maintained was wrongfully detained, have been the focus of conversations as her trial continues.

BRITTNEY GRINER ‘DECIDED TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER ACTIONS’ WITH GUILTY PLEA, LEGAL TEAM SAYS

Hugh Dugan, an American academic and longtime diplomat who served as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs under the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital that Griner’s guilty plea further complicates her release as it gives the Russian government more of a bargaining chip.

""This brings her closer to being identified as a sentenced convict with less than 1% chance of acquittal. There would be more wiggle room if she hadn't gotten to this point, I think, and let the system drag it out and not classify her as such. But this, in my mind, can make her a more valuable resource for Russia, because now they can say we have a legitimate criminal under their law, and we have to be true to our system, etc.,"" Dugan explained.

One of the names being reported as a possibility is Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer known as the ""Merchant of Death,"" who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. after being convicted of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organization.

Dugan explained that this scenario would not be considered ""proportionate"" based on the charges in each respective case.

""When we get to swapping something like this with a hardened terrorist, the proportionality is not the same. And that's always a big concern in negotiation that we don't devalue our person to the point where the next day that same country will take another one of our tourists and another American innocently walking around for the sake of leveraging against some major foreign policy asset that we hold of theirs.""

BRITTNEY GRINER PLEADS GUILTY TO DRUG CHARGES IN RUSSIA

That sentiment was echoed by Tom ​​Schwartz, a distinguished professor of history at Vanderbilt University, who called a prison swap in a high-stakes case like this a ""slippery slope.""

""This type of prisoner swap is a slippery slope, opening the opportunity for other kidnappings of Americans in other countries and the attempt by other nations to gain prisoner releases that way,"" he told Fox News Digital.

Fox News contributor Dan Hoffman, a ​​former CIA station chief, said on the ""Fox News Rundown"" podcast that the practice of pursuing a prisoner swap in cases like this is not a new strategy for the Kremlin.

""The United States has historically been induced to make these sorts of Faustian bargains with the Soviets or in this case, the KGB operative in the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin.""

Following news of Griner’s plea Thursday, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov criticized the U.S. government over its portrayal of the WNBA star’s case and the ""hype"" surrounding her detainment.

""We have a long-standing framework for discussing such issues. The attempts of the American side to stir hype in the public arena, to make noise regarding this topic are very clear, and they don’t help to the practical resolution of issues.""

​​Schwartz said that the comment made by Ryabkov signals that the Kremlin is well aware of the urgency behind Griner’s release.

""He's positioning this and making it clear that Russia now recognizes, you might say, the value of Brittney Griner. I think this could be a bargaining position in the sense that by saying that the agitation is going to make it more difficult for her, he ups the pressure on the president to do something quickly to try and get her released since the agitation shows no sign of quieting. In this sense, the opportunities for quiet diplomacy in this particular case seem to have gone by the wayside.""

The Russian Foreign Minister said Wednesday that Griner will have the opportunity to appeal or apply for clemency once a verdict is given, but the real likelihood of that, while not certain, is grim.

""The Russian judicial system might enjoy giving her slightly less and taking some credit for showing some leniency, but I don't think we're talking about her being released,"" ​​Schwartz said. ""Judging Vladimir Putin has proven to be a very mistake-filled passion on the part of Western analysts who thought he wouldn't invade [Ukraine], thought he wouldn't do this, and he does these things. So he might surprise us again.""

A resolution, in this case, will likely be a long and challenging process, Rebekah Koffler, a Russian-born former U.S. intelligence officer and expert on Russia and Vladimir Putin, told Fox News Digital.

""Putin’s government likely already sent their demands to Washington, either through official channels or back channels. But typically these cases are super hard to adjudicate because of the two legal systems… The U.S. side doesn’t consider Ms. Griner’s arrest as legitimate, even though a substance that’s illegal was found in her possession. The Russians insist that the arrest is legitimate, and they want the U.S. to acknowledge it. So it will be a battle of semantics in one sense that mirrors the Russia and U.S. confrontation over control of Ukraine.""

Ryabkov's comments on Thursday only further solidify the battle that has yet to come.

""The tenacity with which U.S. Administration and representatives of relevant [government] structures in Washington call those who have been sentenced by us on serious charges and are awaiting appropriate verdicts, [as] ""detained persons"" is a reflection of Washington’s unwillingness to perceive the world adequately.""",https://www.foxnews.com

1078,Controversial Instagram account tells 13-year-old Holocaust victim’s tragic story,James Rogers,"

An ambitious but controversial social media project has used Instagram to tell the heartbreaking story of a 13-year-old victim of the Holocaust.

Based on the real-life journal of Eva Heyman, a 13-year-old Jewish girl living in Nazi-occupied Hungary, Eva.stories uses social media to provide a fictionalized retelling of Eva’s final months. From the fun filters and hashtags of the relatively carefree early stories, the Eva character and her family are quickly engulfed in the horrors of the Holocaust.

Deftly combining social media and expert storytelling, the series of 70 Instagram stories chronicles Heyman’s life from February 1944 and the Nazi occupation of Hungary in spring of that year. The series ends with the Eva character being transported to Auschwitz on a cattle truck in June 1944. The real Eva Heyman was killed in a gas chamber at the infamous concentration camp in October 1944.

TROVE OF LOST JEWISH ARTIFACTS, THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN THE HOLOCAUST, DISCOVERED

The juxtaposition of modern social media and the horrific events of the Holocaust is highly effective, documenting Eva’s tragic journey from playful childhood innocence to abject terror and despair. By employing Instagram, the events of 1944 are given a chilling intimacy and gut-wrenching immediacy.

Launched to coincide with Holocaust Remembrance Day, Eva.stories was written and directed by Mati Kochavi and his daughter, Maya. The account has already racked up 1 million followers.

The account, though, has sparked some controversy. The New York Times reports that critics have accused the project of trivializing the Holocaust.

It has also won plenty of praise. “Eva’s Stories on @instagram is an outstanding production that brings the Holocaust to life through the eyes of a young girl.

Eva.stories was also endorsed by Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week.

The account has shone a spotlight on the power of social media to illuminate history.

The mainstream media has largely ignored a leaked voicemail President Joe Biden purportedly left for his son Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, maintaining that any materials that allegedly originated from his son’s now-infamous laptop would not be discussed.

President Biden has repeatedly denied discussing Hunter's business ventures with him, but on June 27, the Daily Mail first published a bombshell voicemail that many feel contradicts previous claims.

""Hey pal, it’s Dad. It’s 8:15 on Wednesday night. If you have a chance give me a call. Nothing urgent—I just wanted to talk with you,"" Biden is heard saying in a voicemail from 2018.

On June 28, the conservative Media Research Center scolded network newscasts for not covering the initial report on the day it was published.

""The voicemail is a veritable smoking gun but ABC, CBS and NBC have yet to report on the latest bombshell development,"" MRC director of media analysis Geoffrey Dickens wrote. ""It’s a stunning revelation that ABC, CBS and NBC have yet to air on any of their evening or morning shows, because they are so in the tank for the Biden administration.""

The blackout has continued, and the story has received little attention, even online.

The New York Times has not mentioned Hunter since May 14, according to a search of its website. The Washington Post has not covered the latest in the story, either, according to a search.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATION CONTINUES INTO HUNTER BIDEN EVEN AFTER HE PAID HIS TAX BILL

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked Tuesday why there was a voicemail of President Biden speaking to his son about his business dealings if he has repeatedly said he has never spoken to his son about his ventures.

""Well, first, I’ll say that what the president said stands,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""So, if he, if that’s what the president said, that, that is what stands.""

When pressed further, Jean-Pierre said she was ""not going to talk about alleged materials from the laptop"" from the podium.

When asked by Fox News if she was disputing that it was, in fact, Biden’s voice on the voicemail, Jean-Pierre said: ""I’m not going to talk about alleged materials on the laptop.""

Afterwards, the New York Post editorial board mocked the situation with a piece headlined, ""Compliant media can’t protect Hunter Biden forever.""

HUNTER BIDEN BUSINESS ASSOCIATE'S TEXT MESSAGES INDICATE MEETING WITH JOE BIDEN

""If a press secretary ‘no comments’ a story away, does it make a sound? Apparently not — if the media are compliant enough,"" the editorial board wrote, noting that Jean-Pierre declined to talk about ""the laptop"" when pressed by Fox News’ Peter Doocy.

""Of course she won’t. After all, such stonewalling has worked since October 2020, when Joe and Hunter cast vague aspersions on the New York Post’s laptop reporting without ever denying its authenticity. They knew it was real, but by dropping ""alleged"" and ‘Russian disinformation!,’ reporters had an excuse to ignore it,"" the editorial board wrote. ""Of course, this strategy only succeeds if enough of the press cooperates. And true to form, no one from the Times, Politico, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, et al. bothered to follow up Doocy’s questions.""

This is far from the first time prominent media outlets have avoided bombshell stories related to Hunter.

In November 2021 it was revealed that an investment firm, of which Hunter is touted as a founder, helped a Chinese company known as China Molybdenum purchase a lucrative cobalt and copper mine from American company Freeport-McMoran. The $2.65-billion deal was struck in 2016 while President Biden was vice president.

Chinese business records reviewed by Fox News in April 2021 showed that Hunter continued to hold a 10% stake in Chinese private equity firm Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) Equity Investment Fund Management Co. through Hunter's company, Skaneateles LLC, despite Hunter’s lawyer claiming otherwise.

HUNTER BIDEN SAGA: NBC NEWS JOINS NYT, WAPO, POLITICO IN VERIFYING LAPTOP DISMISSED AS RUSSIAN DISINFO IN 2020

According to transcripts, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC aired zero coverage of the story. Only The New York Times covered it.

In an email dated Jan. 3, 2017, and sent to Hunter and his business associates Devon Archer and Jim Bulger, CEO of BHR Jonathan Li asked for help getting his son into Brown, Cornell, and New York University.

Soon after, Joe Biden purportedly wrote a college recommendation letter for the son of the Chinese executive.

The email correspondences were found by Fox News Digital on the laptop belonging to Hunter, another bombshell story the media dismissed.

Over an 18-month period, ABC, CBS, and NBC spent only 25 minutes discussing the story, and when they were, they called it Russian ""misinformation.""

CNN’s top bosses were also caught on leaked audiotapes choosing to initially forego coverage of the laptop.

Biden administration officials and those in the president’s camp have long cast materials that came from the laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden as disinformation, which was parroted by the media. However, intelligence community officials have said, as far back as October 2020, that neither the laptop nor materials on it are part of any sort of disinformation campaign.

Since then NBC News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Politico have all acknowledged the laptop was indeed legitimate and belonged to Hunter.

Fox News Digital reached out to CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times and Washington Post for comment on why the story was ignored but did not immediately hear back from any of them.

1081,"Israeli NGO says journalist killed by Palestinians, not by Israeli soldier",Benjamin Weinthal,"

The head of Israeli civil rights organization Shurat HaDin-Israel Law Center pinned the responsibility for the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, an Al-Jazeera journalist, on Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in a complaint filed with the International Criminal Court, Fox News Digital can now reveal.

""It is obvious that the PLO’s (Palestine Liberation Organization’s) terrorist gangs in Jenin are the more reasonable shooters to be suspected and held liable for the reporter’s death,"" Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of Shurat HaDin-Israel Law Center, who filed the suit, told Fox News Digital.

""Abu Mazen (Abbas) should also answer for his responsibility for the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades terror attacks, as a whole, and the killing of the late Abu Akleh.""

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union, is the armed wing of the Fatah movement. Fatah is the ruling party in the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the dominant faction in the PLO. Abbas is at the same time president PA, chairman of the PLO and chairman of Fatah.

AL-JAZEERA REPORTER DIES FOLLOWING DISPUTED INCIDENT IN THE WEST BANK

Al-Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh was killed May 11 during an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) raid to root out terrorists in Jenin, operating under the umbrella of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also a U.S., EU and Israel-designated terrorist organization.

The IDF raid followed Palestinian terrorist attacks in Israel. The death of Abu Akleh, a U.S. citizen, has led to widespread speculation about who killed the journalist during the heavy exchange of gunfire with accusations claiming she was intentionally hit by the Israeli troops, something they have vehemently denied.

The controversy comes a week before President Biden's planned visit to Israel and the region, with Abu Akleh's tragic death seen as being a growing point of contention with the Palestinians following the result of a U.S. State Department analysis.

""Forensic analysis, independent, third-party examiners, as part of a process overseen by the U.S. Security Coordinator (USSC), could not reach a definitive conclusion regarding the origin of the bullet that killed Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh,"" the State Department's website noted. ""Ballistic experts determined the bullet was badly damaged, which prevented a clear conclusion.""

However, the same forensic analysis — in what critics say seems to contradict the lack of knowledge about the origin of the fatal bullet — suggests the bullet probably came from an IDF position.

According to the State Department's statement, ""Gunfire from IDF positions was likely responsible for the death of Shireen Abu Akleh. The USSC found no reason to believe that this was intentional.""

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVERRULES TRUMP POLICY ON PALESTINIANS

The Jerusalem Post reported that the result would likely lead to friction between President Biden and Abbas ahead of their planned meeting in Bethlehem next week.

""The Biden administration deceived us,"" a senior Palestinian official in Ramallah, told the Post. ""We thought they were going to hold an independent and professional investigation. Instead, they fully endorsed the Israeli narrative.""

Fox News Digital sent press queries to the PA and to its mission at the United Nations but got no response as of publication time.

Shurat HaDin said it welcomes the independent U.S. forensic analysis’ findings, according to which ""the ballistic experts determined the bullet (which was provided by the PA) was badly damaged, which prevented a clear conclusion.""

The NGO also noted that ""due to the dubious chain of custody over the bullet, which was [initially] withheld by the PA, there are two options as to the authenticity of the bullet which was supplied by the PA to the American team: If it is the original bullet, then the PA — having their own ballistic experts — has known for months that the bullet cannot incriminate Israel and deliberately withheld it to scapegoat Israel for the death of the reporter.""

ISRAEL ARRESTS 2 PALESTINIANS FOR ALLEGED AX MURDER OF 3 ISRAELIS

The second possibility, Shurat HaDin continued, is that ""this is not the true bullet, and an untraceable bullet was deliberately provided by the Palestinians to the investigation team.""

There are now dueling legal actions in the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands. The International Federation of Journalists is a partner in a complaint lodged against Israel for the death of Abu Akleh, the Palestine Chronicle reported Tuesday.

""U.S. authorities should not rest until those responsible for the death of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh are identified and held to account,"" Sherif Mansour, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Tuesday.

Shurat HaDin said it disclosed ""new information on the circumstances leading to the incident in Jenin"" in its complaint to the ICC.

The ""IDF had acted upon Abbas’ personal request to refrain from entering the Jenin [refugee] camp, allegedly in order to allow the PA’s security forces to assert control over the area,"" the group said. ""Yet, the PA either failed in this effort or deliberately allowed Jenin to become a hornet’s nest of terror, where a new alliance between the AAMB [Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades] and the Islamic Jihad terrorist group was made, establishing the joint ‘Jenin Battalion’ that was involved in the gunfire exchange during the incident.""

In April, Raad Hazem, a 28-year-old Palestinian from Jenin, killed three people and wounded six others in a crowded bar in Tel Aviv. That attack followed a series of other terrorist incidents throughout Israel in March that resulted in the death of 11 people.",https://www.foxnews.com
1082,US spending to counter Russian war effort exceeds first 5 years of war costs in Afghanistan,Caitlin Mcfall,"

The Biden administration and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pledged to counter Russia’s war in Ukraine and the threat it poses to European security, and the funds so far committed to Kyiv already exceed U.S. costs for the first five years in Afghanistan.

The Biden administration on Friday announced another $400 million military drawdown package to Ukraine as it attempts to fend off Russian advances.

The latest package was reportedly tailored in coordination with Ukrainian officials for what they specifically need on the front lines and comes just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory over the eastern Luhansk region.

Heavy artillery like howitzers and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) are among the big-ticket items that Ukraine has said it needs to target Russian command and control hotspots that sit behind the front lines.

RUSSIA MOVES RESERVIST FORCES NEAR UKRAINE FOR OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS: UK DEFENSE MINISTRY

The Pentagon on Friday confirmed that the U.S. has provided $8 billion in security assistance since Russia’s invasion in February, but Washington has committed to spending far more.

Earlier this year, Congress committed to spending $54 billion in traditional foreign aid and military assistance in a move to help squash Putin’s offensive.

The funds will largely be divided through traditional channels to support Ukraine but will also provide support to NATO nations and U.S. troops stationed in Europe.

The majority of the package will be distributed in the immediate term, likely by the end of the year.

There are measures in the latest $40 billion package passed in May that could take years to implement, like the procurement of an additional Patriot missile battery that could potentially be built in an allied nation like Poland, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

It remains unclear how much the U.S. will end up spending in 2022 on countering Putin’s aggression, but, according to information provided by ForeignAssistance.gov, the U.S. has already spent more on security assistance to Ukraine than during the first five years in Afghanistan.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spent time during the two-week July Fourth congressional recess at a ritzy resort in Italy owned by a renowned Italian opera tenor, while Americans faced the country's highest inflation since the 1980s.

Pelosi, a multi-millionaire and the first Italian-American speaker, was spotted at the luxurious Alpemare Beach Club in Forte dei Marmi. A spokesperson said she was at the resort on a day pass and did not stay overnight. The spokesperson declined to say how many times she visited or where she stayed overnight while in Italy.

Alpemare does not discuss its prices until after a phone consultation.

But Tripadvisor, the popular travel rating website, notes that some entrees at the resort’s in-house restaurant cost nearly $150.

1084,Ethan Liming murder: Three arrested in connection to brutal beating of Ohio teen,Haley Chi-Sing,"

The US Marshals announced the arrest of three men in connection with the death of 17-year-old Ethan Liming at an Akron school parking lot on June 2.

20-year old Deshawn Stafford Jr., 19-year-old Tyler Stafford, and 21-year-old Donovon Jones were arrested Saturday morning by the U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force and Akron Police at two separate residential buildings.

""I am happy to report that today, officers with the Akron Police Department, made several arrests in connection with the death of Ethan Liming,"" said Akron Police Chief Stephen Mylett in a press release. ""We thank the members of the community for their outpouring of support that helped investigators throughout this investigation.""

Liming was brutally beaten to death at around 10:46 pm near the basketball courts of the I Promise School in Akron. Officials reported the teen had died from blunt force trauma to the head after he allegedly got into an altercation involving a water gun. Authorities say Liming was lying on the ground in the parking lot when police arrived. They were unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

They then drove in the direction of the basketball courts where the group of teens ""targeted or approached the subjects who were on the court and fired the gel soft gun at them."" These actions seemingly provoked the altercation.

At a press conference on June 8, Mylett stated at least two individuals in Liming's car got out and began firing at four individuals playing basketball on the courts. Mylett said the group ran away before all coming together at Liming's car where Liming was eventually killed.

The water gun was recovered from the scene and included as evidence in the statement.

1088,CatholicVote launches $3 million midterm ad campaign aimed at kicking Catholic Democrats out of office,Thomas Phippen,"

A political ad released this week targets a Catholic politician for not speaking out about the vandalism and violence against pro-life pregnancy centers and Catholic churches.

The ad attacks Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, for doing ""nothing"" while churches are ""firebombed"" and ""radical liberals are acting like terrorists,"" and it's only the first commercial of its kind in a larger campaign from CatholicVote aiming to call out self-proclaimed Catholics, many in the Democratic Party, for not being in line with Catholic teaching.

Highlighting silence from Catholic politicians on suspected arson attacks against churches, as in the Axne ad, is only one aspect of the campaign from CatholicVote, president Brian Burch told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview.

""That's one area we hope to highlight, is that their silence in the face of rampant violence nationwide signals something deeper, and far more worrisome, about the place of Catholic candidates inside the Democratic Party,"" Burch said.

AS ABORTION DEBATE CONTINUES, SUBURBAN WOMEN SHARE HOW SUPREME COURT DECISION WILL INFLUENCE MIDTERM VOTES

But the overarching goal of the CatholicVote midterm campaign, which will see the campaign will see between $2.5 and $3 million in ad spending and target 10 -15 House races and several key senate races in the midterm election, is to help establish faithful Catholic politicians in government, and Burch sees a political shift happening that could put an end to the Catholic Democrat — typified by politicians who profess the faith, but hold vastly different views on moral issues than the church.

President Joe Biden, whose views on abortion have shifted dramatically to align with the platform of his party, is only the second Catholic to be elected to the presidency. According to Burch, Biden represents the last of a certain type of Catholic Democrat.

""This is a big historical shift; obviously for half a century, the Democratic Party was home of the Catholic vote — Catholic voters from immigrant class, to unions to working class,"" Burch said. Many pro-worker policies that used to be the domain of the liberals are now being proposed across the GOP following former President Donald Trump's populist ideas.

DEMOCRATS TO MAKE ABORTION RULING CENTRAL TO 2022 MIDTERMS, REPUBLICANS INSIST VOTERS MORE FOCUSED ON ECONOMY

In the midterms, Burch believes that control of the Senate will come down to key races that feature Catholic politicians. JD Vance, the Republican nominee for Senate in Ohio, converted to Catholicism in 2019. Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters was raised Catholic, Adam Laxalt — who would be the first Catholic senator from Nevada if he defeats Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev. — as was Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has proposed a slate of pro-worker, pro-natalist policies in recent years.

If those Republicans win in November, ""You're going to have a kind of Catholic bloc that's very different than the Catholic bloc that existed over the last 50 years,"" Burch said.

Add in the signs of Hispanic and Latino voters — many of whom are Catholic — are moving toward the Republican Party, and Burch sees Catholics at the center of a new political era.

A key animating issue for Catholic and Evangelical Christians' political advocacy has long been the pro-life movement, and with Roe being overturned, abortion will continue to be a crucial issue as Democrats push for federal abortion protections and Republicans consider a nationwide ban.

""Abortion is going to be at the center of this midterm, and it's impossible to tell the abortion story in politics without talking about the Catholic story. The Catholic Church essentially helped launch the pro-life movement after the 1973 Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, which interpreted abortion as a private act and therefore protected under the U.S. Constitution,"" Burch said.

NASHVILLE PREGNANCY CENTER HIT WITH MOLOTOV COCKTAIL, 'JANE'S REVENGE' GRAFFITI

""The Church has also been a big part of the pregnancy resource movement, which is now under attack,"" he added. The U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) keeps a running list of incidents of suspected violence against parishes since 2020, ranging from repeated damage to sprinkler systems to graffiti and apparent arson. Radical pro-choice groups have taken responsibility for some of the attacks.

‘DEVOUT CATHOLIC’ BIDEN TORCHED FOR APPEALING TO HIS RIGHTS AS A ‘CHILD OF GOD’ TO JUSTIFY ABORTION

Catholic voters have swung between parties in recent decades, and surveys of all Catholics show they are divided in terms of which party they support. The recent ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and sent the issue of abortion to be decided by the states, caused some Catholics to express apprehension at the strong role conservative Catholic justices play on the Supreme Court.

Catholic commentator Maureen Dowd wrote after the draft Dobbs decision leaked in May that she ""feels an intense disquiet that Catholic doctrine may be shaping (or misshaping) the freedom and the future of millions of women, and men. There is a corona of religious fervor around the court, a churchly ethos that threatens to turn our whole country upside down.""

To Burch, whose organization mainly focuses on mobilizing what he calls faithful, or regular Mass-attending Catholics, Roe's end means an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats together to create policies that are more life affirming, beyond the issue of abortion.

Politics is an essential place for Catholics to be involved, Burch argued, because of the mission to create societies that are more caring, acting on Christian principles. Asked about the risk of aligning too closely to a single party, Burch suggested that it's necessary to leverage politics, along with other aspects of culture, to spread the Church's teaching and principles to create life-affirming, just societies.

""We now need to push the Republican Party, and I think you're seeing this, to combine that moral principle with needed assistance for women and families,"" Burch said.

""The potential for public policy has been unleashed now that the shackles of Roe v. Wade have been removed. It's an extraordinary opportunity for the Republican Party to embrace women, children, families in a way that's not just good for people and for the country, but certainly for its own political success,"" he added.",https://www.foxnews.com

1090,Tucker Carlson: US military is intensifying a political purge of the ranks,Tucker Carlson,"

If you want to understand a country’s military, take a look at what its officer corps is reading. Military officers aren’t just warfighters. They’re trained to be thinkers, even intellectuals. Many of them have advanced degrees. In Russia, officers above the rank of colonel are required to read a book by Russian nationalist Alexander Dugin called, ""The Foundations of Geopolitics."" Dugin’s book envisions a Eurasian empire, with Russia at the center of it, and outlines a way to achieve it. In China, meanwhile, recruits are told to read, ""The Origin and Goal of History."" It teaches that China is successful because its culture is superior to the West’s. You might not agree with them, but these are serious books. They promote the national interests of the countries whose officers read them. That’s why they’re assigned.

So, with that in mind, what is the American military reading these days? Let’s see: a sub-literate pamphlet on how the United States is a disgusting, immoral country that must be changed immediately and forever. The tract is titled, ""How to be an Antiracist."" It was written by a University of Florida professor called Henry Rogers, who now that he’s rich and famous goes by his revolutionary name, Ibram X. Kendi. The book is garbage. Actually, it’s worse than that. Not only is the book repetitive and embarrassingly stupid, but it’s also poisonous.

Kendi’s premise is as simple as he is: any system that produces unequal outcomes must be racist. Period. That’s it. That’s the entire thesis. Kendi applies it to everything. If some people make more money than other people, the economy is racist. If Ibram X. Kendi decides there aren’t enough Black astrophysicists, then astrophysics is, by definition, racist. If it rains in a Black neighborhood, but not across town, then what you’re watching is weather racism. Actually, Kendi didn’t really write that, but only because he has no detectable sense of humor. But there’s no question he believes it. The book is that militantly dumb.

So how must America respond to all this racism in the United States? Kendi provides a solution. ""The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination."" He actually wrote that down. In other words, in his book against racism, he promotes racism. You’d think that might be a red flag for people, contradicting as it does the founding principles of the country, as well as basic human decency. But no. The people in charge love the book. It’s all over corporate America. You can probably pick up a free copy at your HR department tomorrow morning if you want.

But the military? You can’t imagine the U.S. military would assign a book like that, recommended to every sailor in the U.S. Navy. Well, yes, actually. Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana demanded an explanation from the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday. Here's how it went:

BANKS: Kendi’s book states that capitalism is essentially racist, and Kendi is clear that racism must be eliminated. So yes or no: Do you personally consider advocating for the destruction of American capitalism to be extremist?

GILDAY: Here’s what I know, congressman. There’s racism in the United States Navy. I have an obligation…

BANKS: It’s a yes or no question, Admiral. Admiral, you recommended that every sailor in the United States Navy read this book. It’s a yes or no question.

GILDAY: I’m not forcing anybody to read the book. It’s on a recommended reading list.

BANKS: Admiral, did you read the book?

GILDAY: I did….

BANKS: Admiral, you read this book. What part of this book is redeeming and qualifies as something that every United States sailor should read it?

GILDAY: I think Kendi’s self-critical of his own journey as an African American in this country, what he’s experienced…

BANKS: Let me ask you again, Admiral: Do you expect that after sailors read this book that says that the United States Navy is racist that we will increase or decrease morale, cohesion, and recruiting rates into the United States Navy?

GILDAY: I think we’ll be a better Navy from having open, honest conversations about racism.

""Open and honest conversations about racism"" — well, that would be nice, but it’s an amusing line, coming from someone who claims to have read Kendi’s book, as Gilday says he has. Open and honest conversations are racist, Kendi has said many times. Let’s say, open and honestly, you decided you cared more about the way people behave than the way they look. Let’s say you took Martin Luther King at his word and judged people by the content of their character, not by their skin color. If you do that, Kendi says, you are a racist. ""The claim of 'not racist' neutrality is a mask for racism. … The language of color blindness is a mask to hide racism. A color-blind Constitution for a white-supremacist America."" That’s the military’s reading.

MILITARY IS ‘MOST INCLUSIVE, LEAST RACIST’ INSTITUTION IN AMERICA: CRENSHAW

So, no, open and honest conversations are not allowed in Kendi’s America. Here’s the choice: admit you’re a racist, or else you’re a super-duper racist. That’s his position.

It sounds pretty deranged, honesty. In fact, it sounds like an extremist ideology – just the kind the military is always us warning about. Keep in mind, the Pentagon is investigating National Guardsmen who posted unfashionable opinions on Facebook about the last election, or may have voted for Trump. So with all their investigators running around looking into people’s thought crimes, how closely have they looked, has the Pentagon looked, into Ibram X. Kendi? Have they checked his social media history? Actually, Rep. Banks asked admiral Gilday that question.

BANKS: In college, Kendi wrote that White people are a different breed of humans and are responsible for the AIDS virus. Yes or no: Do you personally consider the conspiracy that White people started AIDS to be an extremist belief?

GILDAY: Sir, I’d have to understand the context in which the statements were made. Banks: That is a simple question.

GILDAY: I’m not going to sit here…

BANKS: Admiral, this is a book that you recommended every sailor in the United States Navy read.

GILDAY: I’m not going to sit here and defend cherry-picked quotes from somebody’s book. I’m not going to do that.

So Admiral Gilday will not defend the man he’s just been promoting to the entire U.S. Navy. That’s odd, though once you dig a little, you can see why he doesn’t want to talk about it. Not long ago, Kendi was invited to speak at the ""Aspen Ideas Festival,"" a place where ideas go to die.

A roomful of academics waited to hear his wisdom. During the question-and-answer session, one of them asked the most basic question of all: how do you define racism? How do you define it? You’d think Kendi would be ready for it. But he wasn’t. Here’s what he said:

AUDIENCE MEMBER: You talked about the importance of defining racism. Unless I missed it which is possible, I didn’t hear your personal definition. How do you define racism?

KENDI: Racism – I would define it as a collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas. (inaudible) A collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas.

HOUSE REPUBLICAN DEMANDS WEST POINT CEASE CRITICAL RACE THEORY TRAININGS TO MILITARY CADETS

Racism is racist stuff. Or as Kendi put it, it’s ""a collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas."" Right. But how are we defining racism? Kendi couldn’t say. Despite making a bountiful living on topic, getting rich talking about racism, he hadn’t thought about how to define the word.

In a serious society, everyone in the room would have walked out and found something better to do. Bird-watching, maybe.

The so-called intellectual on stage turned out to be an idiot, so they should have left. But they didn’t. They just laughed nervously, worried that if they said something about what had just happened -- if they pointed out that the former Henry Rogers is, in fact, a fraud -- they'd be denounced as well. This is how mediocre people control entire societies: with implied threats. Go along, or we’ll punish you. So they don’t say anything.

The funny thing is, in his book, Kendi admits that he, himself, is a racist. ""White Democrats stood aside and let Bush steal the presidency on the strength of destroyed Black votes. Bush’s team transitioned that winter; I transitioned into hating White people. White people became devils to me, but I had to figure out how they came to be devils.""

ARMY SOCIAL JUSTICE PUSH TAKING FOCUS OFF MISSION: JOCKO WILLINK

So, this is the man Admiral Michael Gilday – it’s hard to believe that Admiral Michael Gilday has any power in the United States, but he does – thinks the United States Navy should study. Imagine working for someone like Admiral Michael Gilday. Most normal people can’t imagine that. So they’re leaving the military.

SEN. COTTON: One marine told us that a military history training session was replaced with mandatory training on police brutality, white privilege, and systemic racism. He reported that several officers are now leaving his unit, citing that training. Another service member told us that their unit was required to read White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo, which claims--and this is a quote--White people raised in Western society are conditioned into a white supremacist worldview. … An airman told us their unit was forced into a racist exercise called a privilege walk, where members of the wing were ordered to separate themselves by race and gender, in order to stratify people based on their perceived privilege.

It’s depressing if you think about it. Good people, driven from military service, many of them serving generationally because their fathers and grandfathers did, are having to leave now purely because of the extremist ideology of its leaders. It’s crushing if you think about it. But it’s also scary for all of us. We need the military. The Pentagon isn’t the Department of Education. It’s not the DMV. We have to have it. It’s essential to the survival of the county. But the commissars in the Biden administration don’t care. They’re not slowing down. They’re intensifying the political purge in the ranks.

1095,Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signs law banning video recording within 8 feet of 'police activity',Anders Hagstrom,"

Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation banning residents from recording video within eight feet of ""police activity"" on Sunday.

The law classifies knowingly filming within eight feet of officers as a class 3 misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to 30 days in jail, $500 in fines and up to a year in probation, according to Arizona law. The law says officers must warn anyone filming at least once before they can be charged with a crime.

The legislation defines police activity as any time law enforcement officers are conducting an arrest, questioning a suspicious person, issuing a summons, handling an emotionally disturbed or disorderly person who is exhibiting abnormal behavior, or enforcing the law.

Critics argue the law could permit officers to simply move toward anyone filming them in order to legally halt the recording.

State Rep. John Kavanagh, the Repulbican who introduced the bill, argues officers would have no reason to move toward someone filming beyond the eight-foot perimeter so long as the person wasn't being suspicious, according to the Arizona Mirror.

Democrats in the state legislature disagreed.

""I have participated in efforts to film police officers that are doing their jobs and you are absolutely a suspicious person to law enforcement at that point. And they aggressively come towards you to see why you were filming,"" state Sen. Martin Quezada told the Mirror.

The new law comes roughly a year after President Joe Biden's Justice Department announced an investigation into the Phoenix Police Department for reports of excessive force and mistreatment of homeless people. The investigation is still ongoing.

1096,"NYC DA's murder charge against clerk who was attacked is ‘inexplicable,' experts say",Rebecca Rosenberg,"

Soft-on-crime New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg's decision to charge a convenience store worker with murder for stabbing an ex-convict in self-defense is ""inexplicable"" and ""shocking,"" experts told Fox News Digital.

Jose Alba, 61, was arrested on a second-degree murder charge and initially held on $500,000 cash bail for the July 1 slaying of Austin Simon, 35, who had attacked him.

The bail was reduced Thursday to a $50,000 bond, which his family has since posted, after Alba spent nearly a week at Rikers Island.

""It’s shocking, shocking, inexplicable, that they charged him,"" said Daniel Bibb, who prosecuted murder cases for nearly three decades under late Manhattan DA Robert Morgenthau.

MANHATTAN BODEGA WORKER CHARGED WITH MURDER WANTED TO AVOID CONFRONTATION, VIDEO SHOWS

""They’re crazy. It’s clear from the video that he’s acting in self-defense. It’s clear from all the evidence that they have thus far,"" railed Bibb, who now works as a criminal defense lawyer.

At the time of the incident, Simon was on probation for assault and already had at least 27 arrests under his belt, according to a source.

The handling of the case has prompted local New York City Council members from both sides of the aisle to demand that the embattled Manhattan DA dismiss the charge. Prominent criminal defense lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman has offered to represent Alba for free.

United Bodegas of America has also rallied behind Alba, with the association’s President Radhames Rodriguez scheduled to meet with Bragg Tuesday to discuss the case.

The alleged murder

The deadly confrontation began at about 11 p.m. in Harlem on a Friday night when Simon’s girlfriend tried to buy a bag of potato chips for her daughter, but her electronic benefits card was declined.

The woman and Alba argued before the clerk allegedly reached over and snatched the chips from her 10-year-old daughter, according to the criminal complaint.

NYC BODEGA WORKER FREED AFTER BAIL IN MURDER CASE IS LOWERED, BUT NO CHARGES FOR VICTIM’S GIRLFRIEND

""I’m going to bring my n— down here, and he gonna f—k you up,"" the irate mom can be heard barking at the clerk in surveillance video obtained by the New York Post. ""My n— is going to come down here right now and f—k you up!""

Minutes later, the woman returned to the store with Simon, who made a beeline for the clerk.

""Papa, I don’t want a problem, papa,"" the clerk told Simon, who stormed into the cashier’s cubicle and violently shoved the older man into a chair, upsetting a row of shelves behind him, according to an earlier video obtained by the New York Post.

The two tussled and Alba grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Simon in the neck and chest at least five times.

A third video obtained by the New York Post, which does not include audio, shows the moment Simon’s girlfriend pulled a knife from her purse and stabbed Alba in the arm.

She initially told detectives that she did not stab anyone, which was later contradicted by the video, according to a source.

The prosecution's reasoning for the charge

The prosecutor assigned to the case, Jennifer Sigall, told investigators that the girlfriend was justified in slashing Alba to defense of her boyfriend, a source told Fox News Digital.

However, Bibb disagreed and believes Simon’s girlfriend should have been charged with assault.

""Mr. Alba should have been released from the precinct, and she [Simon’s girlfriend] should have been charged,"" Bibb said. ""That’s what I would have done.""

Criminal defense lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman, who has represented a slew of high-profile defendants, including Mexican drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, echoed Bibb’s position.

""She’s the one who started all of this,"" Lichtman told Fox News Digital. ""She put him [Alba] in a situation where he felt he needed to use deadly force.""

Lichtman explained the reasoning behind the second-degree murder charge against Alba, which carries a minimum sentence of 15 years to life — although he strongly disagreed with it.

Under New York law, Alba was only justified in using deadly force if he believed he was about to be the recipient of deadly force, Lichtman said. Prosecutors decided that the use of a knife was not a proportional response to a beating.

NEW YORK CITY BODEGA WORKER CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER ALLEGEDLY BEING SEEN ON VIDEO STABBING EX-CON IN DISPUTE

""This is insane,"" Lichtman added. ""Does Alvin Bragg want a city where you’re supposed to get pummeled half to death before you can defend yourself? We’re frankly sick and tired of being abused by a bunch of violent criminals.""

Lichtman has offered to defend Alba for free.

What is a New York City bodega

Rodriguez told Fox News Digital that bodega workers have been victims of the city’s soaring crime rate over the last two years.

There are about 20,000 bodegas scattered throughout New York City mostly concentrated in lower income neighborhoods.

They offer deli sandwiches, single cigarettes known as ""loosies,"" and essential household supplies.

""The bodega is like a family,"" Rodriguez said. ""We know our customers, we know their kids. We know what they take in their coffee because these are people we see every day.""

Since the NYPD’s budget was slashed and police stopped arresting people who commit low level crimes, bodega workers feel increasingly unsafe, he added.

""The police won’t respond anymore if someone steals something,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""But the big problems come after the small problems are ignored.""

Bail initially set at $500,000

Manhattan-prosecutor-turned-defense-lawyer Mark Bederow called the handling of the case ""botched"" from the outset.

The setting of $500,000 cash bail for a man with no criminal history who was not the aggressor is outrageous, he said.

Bederow noted that Bragg’s office has repeatedly come under fire for setting no or low bail on violent criminals.

""It’s a complete 180 from their typical bail policies,"" said Bederow, who worked as a prosecutor under Morgenthau. ""It leaves the public amid an awful crime spree shaking their heads and wondering what’s going on.""

Simon’s conduct could also be considered burglary, Bederow added. Simon entered a closed part of the bodega to commit an assault on Alba, who under the law had a right to terminate a burglary, the lawyer argued.

""Bragg has misread the room,"" Bederow said. ""There isn’t a Manhattan juror who would vote to convict a hardworking man who acted in self-defense.""

1097,"Hawley, law prof clash in heated exchange over who can get pregnant: 'Is this how you run your classroom?'",Ronn Blitzer,"

A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on abortion and the legal consequence of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization blew up during a tense back and forth between Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Berkeley Law Professor Khiara Bridges when the senator questioned her characterization of who can get pregnant.

After Bridges referred to ""people with a capacity for pregnancy,"" Hawley asked if she meant women. When the professor stated that some women cannot get pregnant and that some transgender men and non-binary people can, Hawley questioned whether abortion is really a women's rights issue, as it has historically been presented. This led the professor to accuse Hawley of creating a dangerous situation with his question.

""I want to recognize that your line of questioning is transphobic, and it opens up trans people to violence by not recognizing them,"" said Bridges, who teaches courses in family law as well as reproductive rights and justice.

""Wow, you're saying that I'm opening up people to violence by asking whether or not women are the only folks who can have pregnancies?"" Hawley asked.

Bridges responded by stating that one in five transgender people have attempted to commit suicide.

""Because of my line of questioning?"" Hawley shot back. ""So we can’t talk about it?""

Bridges said Hawley was causing a problem ""by denying that trans people exist and pretending not to know that they exist."" The Republican senator questioned the idea that he was denying that trans people exist by asking a question about women getting pregnant.

Bridges then offered Hawley a test.

""Do you believe that men can get pregnant?"" she asked.

""No! I don’t think men can get pregnant,"" Hawley replied, leading Bridges to state that this means he denies the existence of trans people.

""And that leads to violence?"" Hawley asked, incredulously. ""Is this how you run your classroom? Are students allowed to question you, or are they also treated like this, where they’re told that they’re opening up people to violence by questioning?""

Bridges said she and her students have a good time in her law school class and suggested Hawley come see for himself.

""You should join, you might learn a lot,"" the professor said.

""Wow, I would learn a lot. I’ve learned a lot just from this exchange,"" Hawley replied.

1098,Seattle security guard helps disarm George Floyd rioters with AR-15s stolen from smashed police cruiser,Danielle Wallace,"

A security guard hired to protect a local news crew covering Seattle protests Saturday night disarmed two masked men carrying AR-15 rifles and confiscated the weapons to prevent any injuries, according to reports.

Metropolitan areas across the nation have devolved into rioting and looting for several consecutive nights after the death of George Floyd, a black man seen in the viral video with a Minneapolis officer's knee to his neck, on Memorial Day.

Rioters in Seattle reportedly had stolen two loaded AR-15s out of a smashed Seattle Police Department cruiser lit on fire earlier in the evening. Someone started firing one weapon into vehicles, sending crowds of protesters running from the scene.

WOMAN BEHIND MOLOTOV COCKTAIL ATTACK ON NYPD VAN FACING FEDERAL COUNTS; 2 OTHERS CHARGED

That's when the security guard, a former Special Forces member with Q13 Fox Reporter Brandi Kruse at the scene, got the news crew to safety before pulling his own handgun on the rioter, yanking the AR-15 out of his hand and disarming the weapon.

The guard returned to the crew, who then called 911, but, while waiting for police to arrive, crowds could be heard starting to panic once again. Realizing a second man was armed with another AR-15, the security guard sprung into action again.

The second man, wearing a hoodie and a blue bandana over his face to conceal his identity, could be seen on live broadcast footage carrying an AR-15 before the security guard entered the frame, who pointed his own gun at the man and snatched the rifle.

On Sunday morning, Kruse tweeted a numbered sequence of the events that unfolded at the scene to provide clarification as to what happened. She said Seattle Police “needs to answer for why these weapons were left in police cars in the middle of the riot zone.”

“As I explained on air, our security guard felt that the public was in danger. He took the AR 15 from the rioter and disabled it. We called 911 and waited to hand it over and continue our reporting. Protesters surrounded us, calling us police,” Kruse tweeted.

In an earlier tweet, she wrote: “We have video of them firing one of them and were there when it happened. Witnessed it all. They shouted for people to 'clear the block' then fired and everyone ran.”

She also recounted that at one point during the incident, protesters started to surround her and the news crew, and began accusing them of being members of law enforcement.

“There was a moment after the AR-15 ordeal where a group of rioters surrounded me, screaming that I was a cop. One threatened my life. I am IMMENSELY grateful to a BLM protester who physically put herself between me and the rioters and told them to back off. Thank you, truly,” Kruse wrote.

By Sunday morning, the reporter also shared several images showing volunteers take to the streets of Seattle to scrub graffiti off of buildings and repair other damage done by the rioters.

Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said 27 people were arrested Saturday night and faced charges ranging from assault, arson, property destruction and looting. She said officers and civilians suffered injuries, as rioters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails.

“As the situation continued to intensify, protesters entered the freeway at Spring Street and attacked government buildings. As these groups refused to listen to commands or stop their destruction, SPD officers then had to deploy crowd control measures to end the lawlessness as assaults on officers and property continued. At no time have officers discharged their firearms. There were countless uses of non-lethal and crowd control tools,” she said.

A Uvalde mother who was handcuffed as she tried to run by police outside Robb Elementary School, but eventually got free and rescued her kids, is now being harassed by police after speaking out about the ordeal, her lawyer said this week.

Angeli Rose Gomez, a Uvalde native, was working on a farm roughly half an hour away when she started getting calls about the shooting and rushed to the school.

Her lawyer, Mark Di Carlo, called the scene when she arrived ""the most horrible scenario you could imagine.""

""We had these [$50,000] to $100,000 cruisers surrounding this school, taxpayer items — taxpayer shields and bulletproof vests and sniper rifles – none of those being used to go into the school, but in fact, the SUVs, for example, were being used to block people from going in to save their own children,"" Di Carlo told Fox News Digital on Monday.

Gomez was handcuffed by either a Texas Department of Public Safety Officer or US Marshal as she tried to get past the police line. A Uvalde Police Department officer who knew Gomez then intervened and helped her get free.

""As soon as they take me off the cuffs, I see his arm, like, give me a little gateway, because I'm real little. So, a little gateway where I can just run,"" Gomez told WOAI this week.

She has since shared her story, first with CBS News in early June and with local media this week, prompting a backlash from law enforcement, according to her lawyer.

""Three minutes after the suspect entered the west building, there was a sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armor to isolate, distract, and neutralize the subject,"" McCraw told a Texas Senate committee last week.

Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, meanwhile, accused McCraw of deflecting blame from state law enforcement.

""There were no less than eight law enforcement agencies present in the hallway leading up to the breach of the door at Robb Elementary School,"" McLaughlin said at a Uvalde City Council meeting last week.

1101,Ohio 10-year-old's alleged rapist is Guatemalan illegal immigrant: ICE,Adam Shaw,"

The man charged with the rape of a 10-year-old girl in Ohio is a Guatemalan illegal immigrant, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) source told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

The Columbus Dispatch first reported that Gerson Fuentes was arrested after police said he confessed to raping a child on multiple occasions. He has been charged with rape, and the outlet reported that he was possibly in the country illegally.

The source told Fox that Fuentes is a Guatemalan national in the country illegally and that ICE has placed a detainer on Fuentes, which is a request he eventually be handed over to the agency for removal proceedings.

ICE later confirmed to Fox News Digital that Fuentes is in the U.S. unlawfully.

""On July 13, officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations lodged an immigration detainer on Gerson Fuentes following his arrest by the Columbus, Ohio Police Department for felony rape charges. Fuentes is currently in the custody of local officials at the Franklin County Jail,"" an ICE spokesperson said on Thursday. ""Fuentes has no previous immigration history.""

The story of the alleged rape was initially published in the Indianapolis Star in the context of the victim reportedly having to cross state lines to Indiana to get an abortion due to the state’s laws. It was cited by proponents of abortion access, who highlighted it as an example of the consequences of access being limited.

TEXAS RANCHER FINDS MIGRANTS HIDING ON HER PROPERTY: ‘WE ARE BEING INVADED’

The story was eventually echoed by President Biden in a speech last week in announcing measures to protect abortion access in the wake of the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v Wade.

""Ten years old. Raped, six weeks pregnant. Already traumatized. Was forced to travel to another state. Imagine being that little girl,"" Biden said.

But the story was questioned by some abortion opponents and fact-checkers, given its single source reliance on a Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist who said she had spoken to a ""child abuse doctor"" in Ohio, and its scant detail. The outlet defended its reporting. It drew scrutiny as well from the state attorney general, who said that exceptions to Ohio law would have allowed the girl to obtain an abortion in the state and who said he had not heard of a report being filed in the case.

Fox News reported on Tuesday that an arrest warrant was expected in the case, and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) violation had been filed against the doctor who leaked the story.

The Biden administration has narrowed ICE enforcement priorities to three categories: public safety threats, national security threats and recent border crossers. While a court order recently stopped the administration from implementing the memo narrowing the priorities, a rape charge would almost certainly make an illegal immigrant fit into the category of a public safety threat.

1102,Biden makes Holocaust gaffe during Israel visit,Bradford Betz,"

President Joe Biden, visiting Israel on Wednesday, added yet another entry to his long list of gaffes, mistakenly saying we must keep alive the ""honor of the Holocaust.""

The president made the flub shortly after touching down in Israel, kicking off a two-day visit with the Middle Eastern country’s leaders.

""Later today, I will once more return to the hallowed ground of … Yad Vashem to honor the 6 million Jewish lives that were stolen in a genocide and continue — which we must do every, every day — continue to bear witness, to keep alive the truth and honor of the Holocaust — horror of the Holocaust — honor those we lost, so that we never, ever forget that lesson, you know, and to continue our shared, unending work to fight the poison of anti-Semitism wherever it raises its ugly head,"" Biden said.

Later on Wednesday, the president visited the Yad Vashem memorial to honor Holocaust victims in Jerusalem. Wearing a skullcap, Biden was invited to rekindle the eternal flame in the memorial's Hall of Remembrance. Two Marines placed a wreath on the stone crypt containing the ashes of Holocaust victims and Biden listened as a cantor recited the remembrance prayer.

SECRET SERVICE MEMBER ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN ‘PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER’ IN ISRAEL PRIOR TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S TRIP

The visit marked Biden’s first visit to the Mideast since taking office. The president is expected to offer anxious Israeli leaders strong reassurances of his determination to stop Iran's growing nuclear program, saying he'd be willing to use force ""as a last resort.""

U.S. ally Israel considers Iran to be its greatest enemy, citing its nuclear program, its calls for Israel's destruction and its support for hostile militant groups across the region.

The U.S. and Israel are expected Thursday to unveil a joint declaration cementing their close military ties and strengthening past calls to take military action to halt Iran's nuclear program. A senior Israeli official said before Biden arrived that both countries would commit to ""using all elements of their national power against the Iranian nuclear threat.""

Russian troops were seen Thursday in the center of Kherson, a Black Sea port city in southern Ukraine, a day after Russia claimed to have taken control there, according to reports.

As many as 300 people may have been killed as the Russians entered the city, its mayor estimated. He said many of the bodies were rendered unrecognizable due to the Russians’ high-powered weapons.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

The mayor and Russian defense officials claimed Wednesday that Russian troops gained control the city of about 250,000 to 300,000 people but other Ukraine officials – including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – countered that Ukrainians were still putting up a fight, Reuters reported.

Kherson could become the first city captured by Russia since it launched the invasion of Ukraine a week ago.

In remarks Wednesday, Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops had entered the council building. He called for civilians to stay off the streets at night, Reuters reported.

The mayor said Kherson had no Ukrainian military forces in the city and claimed the city was ""surrounded"" by Russian troops, the Times reported.

Controlling Kherson would give Russia an advantage along Ukraine’s southern coast and help it make a westward push toward Odessa, Ukraine’s third-largest city, the New York Times reported.

1105,"Defiant Taiwanese ready if China invades, say there's only one possible response",Ben Evansky,"

A senior Chinese official in charge of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office upped the ante last week as he told the People's Daily, China's government-run newspaper, the reunification of the two countries was, 'approaching.'

The comments follow months of heightened rhetoric from Beijing. On Friday, Taiwan's ministry of national defense said nine Chinese military jets crossed the ‘median line,’ which resulted in Taiwan scrambling jets in response.

Fox News Digital recently went to Taiwan's capital city of Taipei to take the pulse of some locals on their views of a potential Chinese invasion, U.S. support for Taiwan, their message to President Joe Biden and other issues.

""There's no point, even if I am afraid, we live on this land, there's nothing we can do but to fight back. If that happens, no matter where you are, if someone invades you, you have to fight back, or you die. You might also die fighting so why not fight back?"" one man told Fox News Digital on the prospect of a Chinese invasion.

CHINESE DIPLOMAT SAYS ‘REUNIFICATION’ WITH TAIWAN NEAR, CITES CHINA'S ‘GROWING COMPREHENSIVE STRENGTH’

Speaking in Zhongshan district of the capital, people who spoke to Fox News Digital seemed bullish on the prospect of war with China.

""Taiwan is now more recognized by the world. If China invaded Taiwan 20 or 30 years ago, other countries would not bother to get involved, but now the world sees how much Taiwan has grown over the past decade. So if China really wants to invade, Taiwan's weapons are also very advanced and our military will not be weak,"" a second man said.

The United States does not have official relations with Taiwan but has been stepping up engagement with the island as China seeks to isolate it from global institutions.

""It appears to me that compared to Trump, who is more against China, Biden is more neutral at this moment. I haven't seen him really planning to do anything towards China or Taiwan,"" a young woman said when asked about U.S. support for Taiwan. ""Feels like he's more peace. U.S. is like if the enemy doesn't move, I won't make any move. So no need to make a stand as long as nobody starts a war.""

While none of those speaking opted to give their names, support for Former President Donald Trump's Taiwan efforts seemed significant.

US DEFENDS SENDING AIRCRAFT THROUGH TAIWAN STRAIT AS CHINA GROWS INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE

""Since Trump's time, Taiwan's military power has improved a lot. On one side, Taiwan is developing its technology, which the Americans can certainly see."" The first man said an invasion from China would face an even harder fight compared to Taiwan's past military abilities.

""If they did invade Taiwan back then, Taiwan would be in great danger. Taiwan's military power was nowhere near where we are today. Our military power has improved a lot in the past few years. If China decides to invade Taiwan, it would be a lose-lose. It wouldn't be a win for China either.""

The second man agreed, ""Of course we need to fight back because that's the only way we have to have a result. If we lose, then we return back to China, if we win, then we become independent. It's that simple. If we don't fight, they will always take advantage of us, saying we are part of China.""

The People's Republic of China has long claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, the relatively narrow strip of ocean between the island of Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. The Chinese military has frequently sent planes into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ,) testing Taiwan's air defense response.

""For China, I think they have always considered Taiwan as a part of them. Therefore, they wouldn't be too impulsive. Plus, Taiwan's leadership and all aspects of technology companies are very important. So if war is triggered, it will affect the economy of the whole world and the overall stability will be affected. So I don't think China will be able to fight Taiwan so quickly and so impulsively,"" the unnamed woman told Fox News Digital.

The three people who Fox News Digital spoke to responded to questions on what their message would be to President Biden.

""I hope you will support us if needed,"" said the young woman while another man said, ""You should protect Taiwan. Protecting Taiwan brings the most benefit to the U.S.""

""I hope he will fight for freedom for every small and weak country. This is the voice of every weak and small country. It's because the country is not strong enough. Therefore, it gets bullied and attacked. No one attacks the U.S. or the U.K. because they are strong enough."" the second man said.

""Taiwan is just too small, even if we have weapons, China has 1.4 billion people we only have 20 million. Afterwards, China would still be a country, but Taiwan would be demolished and be gone forever. So there is a need to fight for freedom.""

On China's support for Putin's war against Ukraine and whether it could embolden China in its quest to take over Taiwan, the Taipei local said he thinks something might be in the works as Xi Jinping closes in on another unprecedented term as leader of the People's Republic of China.

""Of course, he wants to make some big move, but in terms of China's economy, he has to be carefully considering the consequences of his actions. Especially now there are some high-tech products in Taiwan which are being used all over the world. If Taiwan is under attack, it won't be beneficial to the rest of the world,"" the first man told Fox News Digital.

1106,Zoo removes parrots from view after they kept swearing at guests,Alexandra Deabler,"

Polly’s got a potty mouth.

A group of parrots at a UK zoo have been removed after repeating obscene language at visitors.

COLORADO ZOO LIVESTREAMS GIRAFFE BIRTH, VIEWERS PLEASED WITH ADORABLE NEWBORN

Lincolnshire Wildlife Park received the five African grey parrots back in August and quarantined them together in the same room, Lincolnshire Live reported. However, the close proximity seemed to have brought out the worst in the birds.

ALASKA NATIONAL PARK'S FAT BEAR WEEK TOURNAMENT RETURNS TO CELEBRATE CHUBBIEST BROWN BEARS

“But, just by coincidence, we took in five in the same week and because they were all quarantined together it meant that one room was just full of swearing birds,” chief executive officer Steve Nichols told the outlet, noting the park employees “always find it very comical when they do swear at you.”

HUNTERS IN ARKANSAS CATCH LONGEST ALLIGATOR IN STATE'S HISTORY: 'I CAN'T STOP SMILING'

“The more they swear the more you usually laugh which then triggers them to swear again,” he added.

""Literally within 20 minutes of being in the introductory, we were told that they had sworn at a customer, and for the next group of people, all sorts of obscenities came out."" — CEO Steve Nichols

After the brief quarantine, the birds were put out for view of guests, assuming the cussing would subside. Though “within 20 minutes” the birds were up to their old tricks.

“Literally within 20 minutes of being in the introductory, we were told that they had sworn at a customer, and for the next group of people, all sorts of obscenities came out,” Nichols told Lincolnshire Live.

Customers found the bird’s dirty language amusing, but park workers were concerned about children visitors and decided to move the birds out of view.

“We put them in an off-shore enclosure with the intention that hopefully they will start learning the other parrot’s noise that are around,” he said.

“What we will do now is release them out but in separate areas so at least if they do swear it is not as bad as three or four of them all blasting it out at once,” he added.

1110,"Pope derides Biden's abortion views, Catholic self-identity as 'incoherence'",Timothy Nerozzi,"

Pope Francis questioned President Biden's conscience on Tuesday in an interview during which he described the commander-in-chief's religious identity and views on abortion as incoherent.

""A month after conception, the DNA of the fetus is already there and the organs are aligned. There is human life,"" the pontiff said in the interview with Spanish-language outlet Univision.

Asked about Biden — a self-professed ""devout Catholic"" who supports blanket legalization of abortion on the federal level — the pope dismissed the president as incomprehensible.

""A month after conception, the DNA of the fetus is already there and the organs are aligned. There is human life,"" the pope said in the Univision interview. ""Is it just to eliminate a human life?""

UNITED NATIONS 'HAS NO POWER,' POPE FRANCIS SAYS

He added that Biden should instead question his own conscience and consult with his bishop.

""I leave it to [President Biden's] conscience and that he speaks to his bishop, his pastor, his parish priest about that incoherence,"" the pope remarked.

The pope has been hesitant to directly meddle in politics since the beginning of his papacy — afraid to devolve the Holy See into a normal, secular world power.

Instead, Pope Francis has taken a more pastoral role via his encyclicals and apostolic journeys — many historic in content.

The Holy Father is currently finishing preparations for a trip to Canada, after which he has committed to visiting the war-torn Ukraine. The first-ever apostolic journey to Moscow is also currently being discussed, should Russian authorities allow the visit.

DC ARCHDIOCESE SILENT ON PELOSI COMMUNION BAN, EMAIL SAYS MEDIA REQUESTS 'WILL BE IGNORED'

Pope Francis's resistance to handing down orders to leaders of other nations is not a new concept.

According to Catholic Canon Law, bishops are the final governing authority in their diocese unless the pope personally intervenes.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains, ""A diocesan bishop in the diocese entrusted to him has all ordinary, proper, and immediate power which is required for the exercise of his pastoral function except for cases which the law or a decree of the Supreme Pontiff reserves to the supreme authority or to another ecclesiastical authority.""

POPE CONFIRMS JOURNEY TO UKRAINE, POSSIBLY RUSSIA, BUT DETAILS YET UNKNOWN

While the Bishop of Rome is the final authority on contested religious doctrine, Pope Francis has made efforts to stay out of local or national deliberations on church governance whenever possible.

The office of bishop comes with extensive responsibilities and powers. Perhaps most prominent is the bishop's responsibility for the pastoral care of Catholics and ex-Catholics in his jurisdiction.

According to canon law, ""A diocesan bishop, frequently preaching in person, is bound to propose and explain to the faithful the truths of the faith which are to be believed and applied to morals.""

Canon law continues, ""He is also to take care that the prescripts of the canons on the ministry of the word, especially those on the homily and catechetical instruction, are carefully observed so that the whole Christian doctrine is handed on to all.""

POPE NAMES NUNS, LAY WOMEN AMONG NEW DICASTERY FOR BISHOPS

However, the pope may not see the canonical corrections he desires for Biden without intervening — Biden and his family attend Holy Spirit Church in the Archdiocese of Washington, DC.

The archdiocese is overseen by Cardinal Wilton Gregory, who has gone on record saying that he would not excommunicate a politician for defending abortion rights.

The cardinal has been so averse to addressing the issue further that his office accidentally let slip that they are ""ignoring"" questions from the media.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., mistakenly emailed a reporter seeking comment on its position regarding the San Francisco archbishop's decision to bar House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , from receiving Holy Communion due to her stance on abortion after Pelosi reportedly took Communion in D.C. on Sunday.

""Just sharing for you to know what comes in,"" the email stated. ""Email since Saturday, when I last checked the comms inbox has just been a couple of random people wanting to tell the Cardinal to bring down the hammer on Pelosi. Aside from Jack Jenkins at RNS, this is the only new media inquiry. It will be ignored, too.""

Speaking about the responsibility of running one of the world's oldest living institutions and the politics that come with it, the pontiff was open about his exhaustion.

""And sometimes, you feel you are numb in the face of situations that should make you suffer greatly and make you move, without missing the opportunity"".",https://www.foxnews.com
1111,Pelosi announces bill on 25th Amendment after questioning Trump's health,Adam Shaw,"

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday announced legislation to create a commission that would allow Congress to oust a president from office, using the 25th Amendment, a day after she accused President Trump of being ""in an altered state"" from his coronavirus treatment.

""This is not about President Trump,"" Pelosi maintained Friday. ""He will face the judgment of the voters. But he shows the need for us to create a process for future presidents.""

Pelosi denied that the timing of the legislation had anything to do with the election and argued that setting up a commission on presidential capacity is needed to ""give some comfort to people"" on the stability of the government.

PELOSI QUESTIONS TRUMP'S HEALTH, SAYS 'WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT'

Trump immediately shot back and said Pelosi's effort is really to remove a future President Joe Biden.

""Crazy Nancy Pelosi is looking at the 25th Amendment in order to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Dems want that to happen fast because Sleepy Joe is out of it!!!

Pelosi was joined at the Capitol by bill author Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who said the coronavirus crisis has further shown the need for a succession plan in the event the president is incapacitated.

""We need to act,"" said Raskin, who was a professor of constitutional law.

“In times of chaos, we must hold fast to our Constitution,” Raskin added. “The 25th amendment is all about the stability of the presidency and the continuity of the office.”

Pelosi had previewed the new legislation on Thursday, telling reporters that she would be “talking about the 25th Amendment” on Friday -- which allows for the vice president to become acting president if it is determined that the president ""is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.""

She questioned the state of Trump's health and his behavior since being diagnosed with COVID-19 amid an outbreak at the White House.

“The public needs to know the health condition of the president,"" Pelosi said Thursday, demanding to know his negative test for the virus before announcing he was infected last week.

Trump later responded: “Crazy Nancy is the one who should be under observation. They don’t call her Crazy for nothing!”

Under the 25th Amendment, Congress, the cabinet and vice president can strip powers from a president if for some reason he or she is declared unfit under dire circumstances. But that requires a 2/3 vote of both houses.

Section 4 of the 25th Amendment also states that a majority of “such other body as Congress may by law"" determine if the president cannot discharge the powers and duties of his office. The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 and Raksin said it's time for Congress to set up this ""body.""

REPUBLICANS BAFFLED BY PELOSI'S 25TH AMENDMENT SUGGESTION, SAY SHE WANTS TO 'STAGE A COUP'

Raskin's bill, which would have to be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by the president, which would set up “the Commission on Presidential Capacity to Discharge the Powers and Duties of the Office.""

The 17 members of the bipartisan commission would work with the vice president to determine whether the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office” due to physical or mental incapacity. Prospectively, that commission would adjudicate the need for a transfer of power.

Raskin introduced a similar bill in 2017 saying Trump has thrown the country into chaos.

“For the security of our people and the safety of the Republic, we need to set up the ‘body’ called for in the 25th Amendment,"" Raskin said at the time. ""The president can fire his entire Cabinet for asking the same question tens of millions of Americans are asking at their dinner tables, but he cannot fire Congress or the expert body we set up under the Constitution.""

While such a bill may pass the Democrat-controlled House, it would seem extremely unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate unless there was a significant development in Trump’s health. However, it introduces a new political narrative just weeks before Election Day.

Trump was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last Friday, began a course of treatment, and returned to the White House Monday -- before returning to the Oval Office on Wednesday.

Pelosi was asked Friday if she thought Trump has met the threshold for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.

""That’s not for us to decide,"" she said.

Several climate protesters were arrested for trespassing in front of Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s Houston home in June of last year.

Texas Tribune reporter Erin Douglas reported the protesters came from the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate activism movement that backs the Green New Deal.

Douglas reported the protesters gathered outside Cruz's home to demand President Biden stop negotiations with the GOP and pass Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's ""civilian climate corps plan.""

Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, a Republican, saw protesters from ShutDownDC outside his Virginia residence outside Washington, D.C., whom he accused of ""threatening"" his wife and their newborn daughter while he was in his state.

Virginia authorities told reporters that the protesters were peaceful but had violated three laws: protesting in front of a home, an ordinance banning noise in front of a home, and littering.

Justice Kavanaugh was also targeted by pro-abortion activists from ShutDownDC at his Maryland home last year. The activists protested Kavanaugh's decision with four other justices to deny an emergency appeal against Texas’ abortion law.

Senator Joe Manchin, D-W.V., was greeted by climate protesters, including those from the Sunrise Movement, outside of the marina where he docks his houseboat in November 2021 over him not supporting President Biden’s multitrillion-dollar reconciliation bill.

1113,"Usama Bin Laden Is Living Comfortably in Iran, Documentary Asserts",Ed Barnes,"

Usama bin Laden gets up each morning in his dark, damp cave in northern Pakistan, gripped by fear, listening carefully for the telltale sound of a drone that is searching for him. His isolation is almost complete. Only a few trusted associates know where he is, and they visit rarely -- bringing food and news, but careful not to fall into a routine. There is no radio or other electronic device whose signal might be followed. He can’t go out in daytime for fear of satellites. It is a grim, lonely existence.

At least, that is the picture that has emerged of the life of the world’s most wanted man since he fled Tora Bora in 2001.

But a new and vastly different picture of the Al Qaeda leader's life has been emerging over the past few years. In this scenario, he wakes each morning in a comfortable bed inside a guarded compound north of Tehran. He is surrounded by his wife and a few children. He keeps a low profile, is allowed limited travel and, in exchange for silence, is given a comfortable life under the protection of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

The idea that Bin Laden is in Iran got a strong boost recently with the premiere of a documentary called “Feathered Cocaine.” In it, Alan Parrot, the film’s subject and one of the world’s foremost falconers, makes a case that Bin Laden, an avid falcon hunter, has been living comfortably in Iran since at least 2003 and continues to pursue the sport relatively freely. He is relaxed, healthy and, according to the film, very comfortable.

To make his case, Parrot, president of the Union for the Conservation of Raptors, took two Icelandic filmmakers, Om Marino Arnarson and Thorkell S. Hardarson, into the secretive world of falconers. It's a world in which some birds can sell for over $1 million, and in which the elite of the Middle East conduct business in luxurious desert camps where money, politics and terror intermingle.

Parrot, who was once the chief falconer for the Shah of Iran and who has worked for the royal families of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, still has extensive contacts in Iran and the falcon world. One of those contacts, described as a warlord from the north of Iran and disguised in a balaclava, reveals in the film that he has met Bin Laden six times on hunting trips inside Iran since March 2003. He says the Al Qaeda leader is relaxed and healthy and so comfortable that “he travels with only four bodyguards.”

Their last confirmed meeting was in 2008, Parrot says. “There may have been more since then, but I haven’t talked to my source since we left Iran,” he said.

Parrot told FOX news.com that the extraordinary disclosure by the warlord, who supplies the falcon camps Bin Laden visits on hunting forays, was not done out of altruism. “One of my men saved his life and this was the repayment,"" he said. ""He was asked to talk. He wasn’t happy about it.”

To prove his case, Parrot said he managed to get the telemetry setting for the falcons Bin Laden was flying, and he provided them to the U.S. Government. “They could locate him to a one-square-mile area using those unique signals”’ he said. He says the government never contacted him to follow up.

Maj. Sean Turner, a Pentagon spokesman, said the U.S. Military would not comment on the whereabouts of Bin Laden.

Parrot's story is supported in the documentary by former CIA agent Robert Baer, an outspoken critic of U.S. policy in the Middle East and of how the CIA is managed. Baer, the onetime Middle East operative on whom the movie Syriana is based, explains that while he was in the CIA, he used satellites to watch the camps and they proved to be one of the key ways Al Qaeda was funded. He underscored how important falconry is to the vastly wealthy, and how Parrot’s position gave him a unique lens on that world.

Parrot's disclosures add another piece to a jigsaw puzzle that for years has fed suspicion that Bin Laden is living in Iran. Among the other clues are:

-- Iran accepted 35 Al Qaeda leaders after the fall of the Taliban, despite the schism between Al Qaeda’s Sunni roots and the Shiite regime in Iran.

-- In February 2009 the U.S. Treasury placed sanctions on several high-ranking Al Qaeda operatives working out of Iran and helping run the terror network.

-- In 2004 author Richard Miniter, in his book “Shadow War,” wrote that two former Iranian Intelligence agents told him they had seen Bin Laden in Iran in 2003.

-- In June 2003 the respected Italian newspaper Corre de la Sierra, http://www.corriere.it/,quoting intelligence reports, reported that Bin Laden was in Iran and preparing new terror attacks.

-- Some analysts believe the reason Bin Laden switched from video to audiocassettes for his announcements was that he couldn’t find a place in Iran that matched the terrain of northern Pakistan.

-- In December 2009 it was widely reported that one of Bin Laden's wives, six of his children and 11 grandchildren were living in a compound in Tehran. The living situation was made public after one of the daughters escaped the compound and sought asylum in the Saudi Embassy. It is in this compound, Parrot says, that Bin Laden has found sanctuary.

Parrot said Bin Laden was renowned as an avid falconer who captured most of the falcons around Kandahar to raise funds to support his terror efforts. Each spring wealthy Arabs from the Gulf would fill military cargo planes full of specially equipped Toyota Land Cruisers and other equipment and fly to the falcon camps in Afghanistan. ""Usama would arrive and presented the falcons as gifts,"" Parrot said. ""In return, the wealthy princes would leave the cars and equipment with him when they left, giving Al Qaeda a considerable material advantage over others, including the Taliban.”

Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism expert at the White House through two administrations, has admitted in interviews and before the 9/11 Commission that on one of the three occasions the United States was able to place Bin Laden, he was in a falcon camp set up by falcon hunters from Dubai. The CIA requested a cruise missile strike against Bin Laden. Clarke said he stopped the government from firing at the camp because “it didn’t look like an Al Qaeda camp.”

“I am not political,” Parrot says, “But he is the most wanted terrorist in the world and it has been frustrating getting the government to listen. Perhaps now they will.”",https://www.foxnews.com
1114,Tucker Carlson: Politicians are continuing to use COVID as a pretext to force their agendas,Tucker Carlson,"

Nobody wants to talk about COVID anymore, and that's certainly understandable. This country lost so much in two years. It's depressing to think about it and the instinct is just to move on, but unfortunately, we don't have that luxury and for two reasons.

First, politicians are continuing to use the virus as a pretext to force their agendas on an unwilling and weary population. That's happening still, believe it or not and second, and maybe more significantly, long term, somebody has got to rescue science from the ideologues who all of a sudden have taken it over. Science must be objective. Science must be honest. Otherwise, everything falls apart.

So, with that in mind, this story. In April of last year, researchers at the CDC concluded a months long study of thousands of health care workers. They included first responders, nurses and physicians. The point of the study was to assess whether the COVID vaccine was working. Researchers split the health care workers into two groups, vaccinated and unvaccinated, and then they watched. What they found was so significant that the head of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, went directly to MSNBC to tell the world what researchers had found and here's what she said.

This is word for word: ""Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick and that's not just in clinical trials, but also in real-world data."" Now, that turned out not simply to be untrue, but in some sense to be the opposite of the truth. In some cases, the vaccinated are more likely to get variants of COVID. The death rates around the world for the vaccinated are extraordinarily high, but at the time, anyone who had doubts about what Rochelle Walensky said was told to shut up.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BA.5, THE VACCINE-RESISTANT VARIANT OF OMICRON

Those who questioned her out loud were kicked off social media. If you kept questioning, you might be fired from your job. Doubting Rochelle Walensky's promises, doubting the Biden administration's claims about the COVID vaccine was totally unacceptable. It was like questioning their views on herd immunity or mandatory masking for children or airline passengers or closing the schools.

Now that we know that virtually everything they said about COVID was wrong, however, no one has admitted it, and no one has been punished. No one at the CDC was fired for this. In fact, they were elevated. Under Joe Biden, the people who made these claims, these false claims, have even more power than ever. Rochelle Walensky is back on television. She's demanding that parents force their children as young as six months old to take the COVID shot . They're all saying this, Tony Fauci, Joe Biden too. Watch.

ROCHELLE WALENSKY: I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day. Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.

BEIJING RESIDENTS ASKED TO WEAR MONITORING BRACELETS TO ENFORCE COVID QUARANTINE, PROMPTING OUTCRY

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: They do get infected and they do pass the infection. So, we would hope that family members who are responsible for the children will realize that and will be enthusiastic about getting their children vaccinated.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: And finally, COVID-19 vaccinations for children over five years of age. Finally, some peace of mind.

Amazingly, despite all of their demonstrated failures, all of their documented dishonesty, those three people are still, as of tonight, in charge of this country's response to COVID. It's remarkable, if you think about it. So, parents thinking about how to treat their own children are in a very tough position. One of the COVID shots that Walensky and Fauci and Biden are telling you to give your small kids is manufactured by Moderna.

Now, you might recall that Moderna's COVID vaccine for adults was suspended from use in several countries after researchers found that it caused potentially very dangerous heart inflammation in young people. The other COVID vaccine that's been approved for toddlers in the United States is made by Pfizer. Pfizer's vaccine for adults has also been linked to heart damage, to myocarditis in young people. So, a lot of parents are wondering, should we give this to our toddler? How do we find the answer?

‘NO SYMPATHY’: AOC BLASTED FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT HARASSMENT THOUGH SHE BELITTLED KAVANAUGH’S HARASSMENT

Virtually every news show in America seems to be sponsored by Pfizer, so clearly turning on television is not going to give you an answer you can trust. You need to find an independent, science-minded researcher or physician who's looked at the actual data. And there are very few who who've done that and are willing to be honest about it. Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins University is one of them. He's just written a remarkable piece in Bari Weiss' Substack, and he wrote it with epidemiologist Tracy Hoeg.

Makary and Hoeg found that Pfizer and Moderna provided, and were quoting, ""extremely weak, inconclusive data"" to justify vaccinating children as young as six months in the United States. ""Using a three-dose vaccine in 992 children between the ages of six months and five years, Pfizer found no statistically significant evidence of vaccine efficacy,"" they wrote. ""In the subgroup of children aged six months to two years of trial found that the vaccine could result in a 99% lower chance of infection, but that they also have a 370% increased chance of being infected.""

What does that mean? We have no idea, and we don't know how you would know because those data are completely incoherent. They do not present a picture that suggests a path forward. They're inherently confusing. Meanwhile, Moderna ""claimed a very weak vaccine efficacy of just 4% in children aged six months to two years."" That is not a statistically significant result either.",https://www.foxnews.com
1119,"Ohio 10-year-old's alleged illegal immigrant rapist, 27, was listed as minor in abortionist’s report to state",Thomas Catenacci,"

The Guatemalan illegal immigrant charged with raping and impregnating an Ohio 10-year-old who traveled to Indiana for an abortion was listed as a minor in the report the Indiana-based abortionist sent to authorities.

Dr. Caitlin Bernard reported that the alleged rapist was approximately 17-years-old in an official filing to the Indiana Department of Health obtained Thursday by Fox News Digital. On Wednesday, Ohio authorities charged 27-year-old Gerson Fuentes, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, with rape of a minor under 13 years old in the case.

Fuentes confessed to the crime to Columbus Police Department investigators, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement Wednesday.

OHIO MAN, 27, CHARGED WITH RAPE OF GIRL, 10, WHO REPORTEDLY SOUGHT ABORTION IN INDIANA

However, the 10-year-old's mother said her daughter was ""fine"" and ""everything they say about [Gerson Flores] is a lie"" when confronted Thursday by a Telemundo reporter.

The alleged rape made headlines earlier this month after Bernard told The Indy Star on July 1 she had performed an abortion for a young rape victim who she said was forced to cross state lines from Ohio in order to receive the procedure. Ohio implemented a six-week abortion ban shortly after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision which granted women the federal right to an abortion.

""It’s hard to imagine that in just a few short weeks we will have no ability to provide that care,"" Bernard told The Indy Star at the time, referencing a potential similar abortion ban that could go into effect in Indiana following the high court's ruling.

Following Bernard's comments, President Biden referenced the incident during a speech on July 11 and, on July 3, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem was asked during a CNN interview whether she would force young victims of rape ""to have a baby.""

GOV. KRISTI NOEM ASKED IF SOUTH DAKOTA WILL FORCE A 10-YEAR-OLD TO HAVE A BABY ON CNN'S 'STATE OF THE UNION'

In addition, after Fuentes was charged Wednesday, Republican Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita announced he would investigate Bernard for failing to report the abortion, saying ""failure to do so constitutes a crime in Indiana."" But the documents obtained Thursday by Fox News Digital show Bernard successfully filed the proper report with the state on July 2.

""My client, Dr. Caitlin Bernard, took every appropriate and proper action in accordance with the law and both her medical and ethical training as a physician,"" Bernard's lawyer Kathleen DeLaney said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""She followed all relevant policies, procedures and regulations in this case, just as she does every day to provide the best possible care for her patients.""

""She has not violated any law, including patient privacy laws, and she has not been disciplined by her employer,"" DeLaney continued. ""We are considering legal action against those who have smeared my client, including Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, and know that the facts will all come out in due time.""

1120,Florida sheriff releases video of armed home intruders fleeing when intended victim fires back with rifle,Paul Best,"

The Escambia County Sheriff's Office released video of a Florida homeowner firing a rifle at home intruders as deputies try to identify the fourth suspect.

Three of the suspects approached the victim's home while a fourth waited in a car. When the victim unlocked the front door, two of the men allegedly pushed their way inside and started attacking him, while the third waited outside with a handgun.

The victim was armed but lost his gun during the scuffle, then ran to the back of his house and grabbed an AK-47-style rifle, which he started firing at the intruders, Escambia County Sheriff Chip Simmons said.

""He did absolutely nothing wrong,"" Simmons told ""Fox & Friends First"" on Thursday. ""If someone breaks into my front door, barges and attacks me or my family, they're going to get shot, and I afford that same consideration to the residents of my county.""

1121,"Newly launched non-woke comic book defies cancel culture, brings in over $1.7M in first four days",Lorraine Taylor,"

In a world full of ""woke"" culture, one man is taking an artistic stand.

Writer, content creator and musician Eric July is adding a new feather to his cap: comic book creator. July officially launched his first comic book ""Isom #1"" through publishing company Rippaverse on Monday — and it’s been a smashing success.

July’s book has already brought in more than $1.7 million in pre-orders in just the first four days. Nearly 19,000 people have pre-ordered — but not everyone is happy about it.

The release of ""Isom #1"" created somewhat of a stir on social media, particularly Reddit, where promotional videos for the comic book were banned from certain subreddits for ""supporting comics from hate groups.""

AUTHOR'S PRO-POLICE COMIC BOOK CENSORED ON SOCIAL MEDIA: ‘SMALL MINORITY OF LOUD VOICES’

But July tells Fox News Digital his comic book company is no such thing. ""A lot of it has to do with the fact that I am a person that they simply do not like,"" he said.

July, a self-described libertarian, hosts his own podcast and has appeared on several media outlets as a political commentator. July said he is ""on a mission to spread liberty, speak out against nonsense and work towards a more free and prosperous society.""

July said a lot of entertainment today is out to ""beat people over the head with stuff like social justice"" and left-leaning agendas.

""To see the industry go in the direction that it’s gone kind of lights a fire under you,"" July said. ""It’s not like it’s getting any better. These people are doubling down on everything that they’re doing no matter how often the fans reject it.""

So, he created Rippaverse.

""I put my money where my mouth is,"" July said. ""I just started a comic book company. I told people I’m not beating the audience over the head with my individual political views with this, and that got me called the most ugly names I’ve probably ever been called in my life.""

DC COMICS' ‘WOKE’ SUPERMAN REBOOT FAILS TO FLY WITH READERS: REPORT

But the constant comments about his race and political views will not stop him from making a return to the essence of what he says comic books are all about.

July explained that a lot of people see comic books as an escape from the real world and an opportunity to enjoy themselves and ""get their morale up.""

SUPERMAN COLORIST QUITS OVER COMIC'S EMBRACE OF WOKENESS: ‘TIRED OF THIS S***’

""I like seeing people be stoked. I like seeing people be happy and enthusiastic about something that is happening in entertainment. The last five, six years, it’s been rough for a lot of people [because] folks have just been holding their nose as they go through and consume whatever entertainment it is that they’re consuming,"" he said.

July said he hopes to build a fandom where people can share their theories and build friendships.

""We’re seeing success and people are enthusiastic. Customers are enthusiastic and that’s why they hate us,"" he said. ""This is what I do. This is my passion. I’m a comic book lifer.""

""Isom #1"" follows the story of Avery Silman, a common rancher in Florepark, Texas, who ""obtained some unique abilities"" and spent a brief time acting as a hero under the moniker Isom. Things take a turn for Silman when he gets a call from his sister about an old friend who has become one of the most feared men in the city. Silman goes to visit his childhood friend and ends up in some violent altercations as he is sucked back into the world of ""excepts"" or ""special beings.""

The 96-page comic book will serve as a launching pad for the entire Rippaverse Comics universe. The comics are brought to life through July’s writing, Cliff Richards’ pencil and ink work, Gabe Eltaeb’s color work and Eric Weathers’ lettering.

For now, July is heading back to the drawing board — quite literally. He said it’s time to get back to work.

The commitment from Saudi Arabia came after bilateral meetings between President Biden and administration officials and King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Said and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as Saudi Ministers.

""Saudi Arabia has committed to support global oil market balancing for sustained economic growth,"" the White House said. ""We have welcomed the increase in production levels 50 percent above what was planned for July and August.""

""These steps and further steps that we anticipate over the coming weeks have and will help stabilize markets considerably,"" the White House said.

Also in the meetings, the White House said Biden welcomed the singing of a bilateral Partnership Framework for Advancing Clean Energy, with new Saudi investments to ""accelerate the energy transition and combat the effects of climate change.""

The White House said the framework ""focuses particularly on solar, green hydrogen, nuclear, and other clean energy initiatives.""

""By building upon existing collaboration between energy experts in our countries, we seek to enhance our efforts to tackle climate change and advance greater deployment of clean energy resources around the world,"" the White House said, noting the partnership ""will leverage public and private sector collaboration to advance the deployment of clean energy solutions while accelerating research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies needed to decarbonize the global economy and achieve net-zero emissions.""

For weeks, the White House had stressed that oil production is ""not the focus"" of conversations Biden will have with officials in Saudi Arabia.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel and its extended group of allied producers known as OPEC+ agreed last month to ramp up oil production this summer after months of resistance amid soaring global energy prices.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday referenced that announcement, saying it would be discussed during meetings in Saudi Arabia.

""We are hopeful that we will see additional actions by OPEC+ in the coming weeks.""

WHITE HOUSE SAYS OIL PRODUCTION 'NOT THE FOCUS' OF CONVERSATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA

Also in the meeting, Biden and Saudi officials signed bilateral agreements on cybersecurity—one with the FBI and the other with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The White House also announced that Saudi Arabia committed to extending and strengthening the UN-mediated truce in Yemen, which has led to 15 weeks of peace in the region. The support included a pledge to provide more than $1 billion for development projects and fuel support.

1129,Gay pride flag hoisted above US embassy in Israel,Paul Alster,"

The U.S. Embassy broke new ground and raised a few eyebrows by flying the rainbow-colored gay pride flag below the Stars and Stripes in a show of support for the city’s week long Gay Pride week, not to mention a rare example of tolerance in the wider Middle East.

“Proudly flying the colors!"" read a dual-language post on the Facebook page of U.S. Ambassador Dan Shapiro’s office. ""For the first time in history, the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv has raised the Pride flag together with our American flag. We are proud to join with the municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo and its residents in celebrating LGBT [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual] Pride Week.”

The Tel Aviv embassy gesture to the local gay community is not the first of its kind though. Last month, according to Spanish media reports, the gay pride flag flew over U.S. Ambassador James Costos’ official residence in Madrid, and last September, the flag was unfurled by Ambassador Theodore Sedgwick at the U.S. Embassy in Bratislava, in Slovakia.

Reaction from outside of the gay community to the sight of the American flag being accompanied by the rainbow banner was mixed.

“I see that it is OK to put up a gay pride flag over an embassy but not ok for military members to espouse their religious beliefs in God,"" read a post on the Embassy's page, attributed to Grant Hix Jones. ""I am ashamed to see those flags side by side.”

“How is this ""gay pride flag"" representative of all Americans?"" wrote a poster named James Brown. ""This flag needs to come down.”

While most people posting messages on the embassy Facebook page expressed various shades of disapproval, on the other side of the debate there were those in favor of hoisting the gay flag, with “Way to go!” and “Proud” being among the posted comments.

An embassy official told FoxNews.com all the responses were appreciated.

“We are glad to see our Facebook page utilized as a forum for free speech,” the official said.

Shapiro announced late last month that the flag would fly above the building, noting ""the United States’ strong support for the LGBT community at home and abroad.""

Corey Bardash, co-chairman of Republicans Abroad-Israel, said embassies in neighboring countries would be displeased by such a display.

“Regardless of one’s religious or political sensitivities this is the only country in the Middle East where America would feel its embassy wouldn’t come under attack by doing such a thing”, Bardash told FoxNews.com. “I remember when, not so long ago, [former Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmedinejad said there are no gay people in Iran!”

“This is part of society here, despite the fact we have a large, traditional, religious minority,” Bardash continued. “It shows that there is a little island in the Middle East that shares the same democratic values as America. It’s shocking that there are some LGBT overseas that are against Israel, something completely against their own interests when there are death sentences in [Muslim] countries around the region against their own gay communities, including close by here with the Palestinians.”

A former Pennsylvania congressman has pleaded guilty to extensive voter fraud, including stuffing ballot boxes for Democratic candidates, spanning multiple elections in the state.

Former U.S. Rep. Michael ""Ozzie"" Myers, 79, of Philadelphia, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deprive voters of civil rights, bribery, obstruction of justice, falsification of voting records, and conspiring to illegally vote in a federal election, the Justice Department announced Monday.

Federal prosecutors said Myers orchestrated schemes to fraudulently stuff ballot boxes for Democratic candidates in the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 Pennsylvania elections.

Myers admitted to bribing an elections judge, Domenick Demuro, in a voter fraud scheme over several years. Demuro pleaded guilty in May 2020 and was convicted for his role in accepting bribes to cast fraudulent ballots and certify false voting results.

A transgender woman incarcerated at a women’s only prison in New Jersey has been moved to another facility after impregnating two female inmates earlier this year, according to a local report.

Demi Minor, 27, was transferred last month from the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Clinton to Garden State Youth Correctional Facility, a prison for young adult offenders located in Burlington County, Dan Sperrazza, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Corrections (NJDOC), told NJ.com.

Sperrazza said Minor, who is serving a 30-year sentence for manslaughter, is currently the only woman incarcerated at the facility and was placed in the vulnerable unit. He couldn’t comment further on Minor’s housing situation due to NJDOC’s privacy policies, the paper reported.

Minor’s move comes after the paper reported in April that Sperrazza said it appeared two women at Edna Mahan became pregnant after ""consensual sexual relationships with another incarcerated person.""

JUDGE BLOCKS BIDEN ADMIN'S TRANSGENDER SCHOOL BATHROOM RULE

Minor has since claimed in a July 15 post written on her website Justice 4 Demi that corrections officers beat her during her transfer, according to reports.

The department of corrections told NJ.com that it is investigating but could not comment further.

""NJDOC cannot comment on any active investigations,"" a statement read. ""The Department has zero tolerance for abuse, and the safety and security of the incarcerated population and staff are of critical importance.""

Edna Mahan Correctional Facility has faced a long string of sex assault scandals and Gov. Phil Murphy announced plans last year to shutter the facility, which is New Jersey’s only women’s prison.

In 2021, New Jersey enacted a policy to allow prisoners to be housed according to their gender identity following a lawsuit brought forth by a trans inmate who lived in men’s prisons for 18 months and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. The policy was mandated to remain in effect for at least one year.

Sperrazza told the paper that while the NJDOC continues to operate under the policy, ""the department is currently reviewing the policy for housing transgender incarcerated persons with the intention of implementing minor modifications.""

Minor is eligible for parole in 2037, the paper reported, citing NJDOC.

1132,Banning Circumcision and Targeting Jews In San Francisco -- How Dare They?,Rabbi Abraham Cooper,"

How dare they?



For 35 years I’ve been involved in fighting the world’s oldest hate, anti-Semitism, wherever it rears its ugly head from Soviet Russia, to the Mullahtocracy in Iran, and Chavez's bullies in Venezuela.



And now, from the Western World's beacon of Enlightenment, San Francisco comes a proposed new diktat that would criminalize a central tenet of Judaism by jailing and fining Jews like me for having our 8-day-old boys ritually circumcised.

To be sure, this isn't the first time Jewish practices have been outlawed; just the first time in a democracy. The organizers of San Francisco's campaign have historic precedent dating back to 167 BC, when Antiochus IV, a Greek ruler, ban of circumcision in the Holy Land, helped spark the Maccabean revolt. A few hundred years later, another tyrant, Hadrian, the most anti-Semitic Roman ruler ever who sought to crush the Jewish nation once and for all, banned this practice as well.

During the Stalin era, Mohels, the pious practioners of this biblical commandment, performed the banned ancient rite in great secrecy. Some of those caught were jailed, sent to the Gulag and/or killed by the NKVD.

Hitler’s Final Solution murdered 1.5 million Jewish kids. Racist Nazi law forbade Germans from following the abhorrent practice of circumcision as an affront to the image of the pure Aryan race.

What motivates today’s ‘activists’? One San Francisco campaigner, Matthew Hess, leaves nothing to the imagination. In the true spirit of the finest Nazi propaganda he created a comic book deploying classic anti-Semitic caricatures of hooked-nosed “monster Mohels” confronted by an Aryan blonde- haired, blue- eyed “Foreskin Man” hero.



Others may detest the central message of Jewish circumcision: Not everything that is “natural” in this world is perfect. Humans are supposed to perfect our world through their own actions, indeed improving upon what G-d created. The good Lord deliberately left room for that, to challenge us to act.



These fanatics cannot tolerate such talk from people apparently stupid enough to believe religion should be a guide for living. In their vision of “the more perfect union” there is room only for their “enlightened” values.



I imagine that among the self-anointed anti-circumcision campaigners are people who don’t detest Jews or Jewish values. But too many do.



Memo to San Francisco voters: The world’s oldest hatred will only be dead and buried when you stop tolerating it and exact a price for bigotry.

Research organization RAND has run dozens of wargames simulating major conflict scenarios in what it describes as Russia and China’s “backyards.” The wargames suggest that the U.S. forces in those locations would get attacked by a vast array of both conventional and cyber weapons.

RAND Senior Defense Analyst David Ochmanek discussed the simulations at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) in Washington D.C. last week. “In our games, where we fight China or Russia … blue gets its a** handed to it, not to put too fine a point on it,” he said, during a panel discussion. Blue denotes U.S. forces in the simulations.

AIR FORCE BUILDS NEW DEEP STRIKE 'SPY NETWORK' FOR AIR ATTACK

“We lost a lot of people, we lose a lot of equipment, we usually fail to achieve our objectives of preventing aggression by the adversary,” Ochmanek added during the CNAS discussion.

Based on the wargames, a clash with Russia in the Baltic states would result in the rapid defeat of U.S. forces and their allies, Ochmanek told Fox News. “Within 48 to 72 hours, Russian forces are able to reach a capital of a Baltic state,” he said. On the other side of the world, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, while a massive military gamble for China, would also pose a huge challenge for U.S. forces in the area, according to Ochmanek.

Russia and China have amassed large inventories of precision-guided cruise missiles and ballistic missiles that can reach hundreds of miles and strike military targets, the researcher said. Set against this backdrop, U.S. military outposts and aircraft carriers in the contested regions could face a potential devastating barrage of missiles.

ABRAMS TANK SET FOR 'LETHALITY' UPGRADE

In RAND’s wargames and analysis, Russia, and particularly China, unleash so many missiles that they overcome U.S. defenses. “They send salvos that are so great that we cannot intercept all the missiles,” Ochmanek said.

The researcher notes that the key “domains of warfare” are contested from the start of hostilities. The U.S., he explains, should not assume air and maritime superiority over the battlespace. American space assets could also face attacks, while U.S. command and control systems could be targeted by electromagnetic and cyber weapons.

To combat these threats, U.S. forces could ramp up their deployment of so-called ‘standoff’ missiles that can be fired from large distances, such as cruise missiles, according to Ochmanek, along with highly robust reconnaissance systems and jam-resistant communications.

AIR FORCE FAST-TRACKS NEW NUCLEAR MISSILES

“For a sustained investment of an additional $8 billion a year between 2020 and 2030, the U.S. Air Force could buy the kit needed to make a difference,” he said, noting that similar sums would be required for the Army and Navy.

President Trump’s fiscal 2020 budget plan proposes $750 billion for defense, up 5 percent from fiscal 2019.

America’s posture is also key when it comes to challenging potential adversaries such as Russia, according to Ochmanek. “It’s putting more combat power back into Europe, and putting it on Europe’s eastern flank,” he said.

NAVY PLANS 'BLUE FORCE' OPEN WATER WEAPONS STRATEGY FOR NEW FRIGATE

The U.S. National Defense Strategy, which was released by the DoD last year, cites the restoration of “America’s competitive edge by blocking global rivals Russia and China from challenging the U.S. and our allies,” as one its key goals.

“Long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities for the Department, and require both increased and sustained investment, because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S. security and prosperity today, and the potential for those threats to increase in the future,” the strategy explains.

1135,Liberal group lands $171M gov't contract that could reach $1B to help illegal immigrants avoid deportation,Joe Schoffstall,"

A left-wing nonprofit working to end mass incarceration landed a $171.7 million taxpayer-funded government contract that could potentially hit $1 billion to help unaccompanied minors avoid deportation, Fox News Digital has discovered.

The Vera Institute of Justice, a New York-based group that supports defunding police and views immigration enforcement agencies as a ""threat"" to civil liberties, was awarded a Health and Human Services-funded contract in March to provide legal assistance to unaccompanied minors, according to a federal database.

The arrangement lasts until March 2023 but can reach as high as $983 million if renewed until March 2027, the agreement shows. This appears to be the largest federal contract Vera has secured for immigration-related services for any single year dating back to the mid-2000s.

The lofty nine-figure contract came amid an escalating border crisis that saw more than 239,000 migrant encounters in May alone -- a historic high. There were 14,699 encounters of unaccompanied minors in May, an increase from the 12,180 encountered in April and slightly higher than the 14,052 encountered in May 2021.

BIDEN, MEETING WITH MEXICAN PRESIDENT, URGES HELP FROM REGION TO STOP BORDER SMUGGLING

According to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), there was an average of 692 minors in the agency's custody during May. So far, there have been more than 100,000 unaccompanied minor encounters in fiscal year 2022, which started in October, compared to 147,925 for fiscal year 2021 and 33,239 in fiscal year 2020.

Unaccompanied minors are not being removed under the Title 42 public health order -- which has been used to expel a majority of migrants coming across the southern border due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Instead, they are typically transferred into the custody of Health and Human Services -- and moved across the country to parents or sponsors already in the country.

The Biden administration has scrambled to deal with the massive surge of unaccompanied children, as well as adult migrants and family units, coming across the border. Most recently, the Biden administration signed a five-year contract to start leasing an abandoned school in Greensboro, North Carolina, to house unaccompanied minors away from the southern border.

BIDEN ADMIN SIGNS FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT TO HOUSE MIGRANT KIDS AT FORMER NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL

Potentially thousands of migrant children will be detained at the American Hebrew Academy campus in Greensboro until they can be housed with either family members already living here in the U.S. or other sponsors, Fox News learned last month.

Republicans have blamed the Biden administration for the massive surge in migration to the southern border, pointing to more liberal policies, including limiting of interior enforcement, calls for amnesty for illegal immigrants -- and the rolling back of Trump-era policies like the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) and border wall construction.

The Biden administration has focused its response to the crisis on targeting ""root causes"" like poverty, violence, corruption and climate change in Central America.

MCCARTHY SAYS BIDEN SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO BORDER PATROL AGENTS AFTER CBP FINDS THEY DIDN'T WHIP MIGRANTS

The Vera Insitute, meanwhile, is propelled by taxpayer-backed government grants and contracts like the one it secured in March. Between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, $152 million of the group's $191 million in revenue came from government sources, its most recent financial audit shows.

The institute seeks to end ""mass incarceration"" by cutting down on the number of jails, prisons and detention centers in the United States. The group has also signaled support for defunding police.

Additionally, Vera conducts ""on-the-ground work"" with progressive prosecutor offices to help them ""implement policies and build evidence that limiting the number of people who enter the criminal legal system and centering racial equity makes the public safer,"" according to its website.

The institute also launched the ""Motion for Justice"" campaign, in which they work with prosecutor offices and community-based groups to ""improve safety by creating diversion programs"" that focus on racial equity.

According to multiple reports, Nirdesh Upadhyay of Bareilly, India, was standing on his third-floor roof terrace with his wife and the child when the animals landed and surrounded them.

Nirdesh reportedly tried to run away from them with the 4-month-old, when the baby fell out of his hands to the ground and one of the monkeys grabbed him before he could pick him back up and threw him over the side.

The child died immediately.

1138,Pence endorses rival to Trump-backed candidate in Arizona GOP gubernatorial primary,Paul Steinhauser,"

Former Vice President Pence is once again at odds with his one-time boss, former President Trump.

Pence on Monday endorsed real estate developer and Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson in next month’s GOP gubernatorial primary in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Doug Ducey.

The former vice president called Taylor Robson ""the best choice for Arizona’s future"" and emphasized in his statement that ""as Arizona Democrats pursue the reckless Biden-Harris agenda, Karrin Taylor Robson is the only candidate for governor that will keep Arizona’s border secure and streets safe, empower parents and create great schools, and promote conservative values.""

Taylor Robson is one of the two polling front-runners in the Republican primary in a field of four candidates, along with former TV news anchor Kari Lake, who for months has been supported by Trump. The winner of the Republican primary will likely face off in November with Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is the leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in the one-time red state that has become a top general election battleground between the two major parties.

ARIZONA PRIMARY SHOWDOWN: DUCEY BACKS RIVAL TO TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATE

While Taylor Robson and Lake mostly agree on many of the top issues in the Arizona primary battle – such as illegal immigration and border security, the economy and water conservation. While both have issues with Trump’s 2020 election loss to President Biden, Lake heavily supports the former president’s unproven claims that the 2020 presidential contest was ""rigged"" and ""stolen.""

Taylor Robson, highlighting the Pence endorsement, said, ""He has been a warrior for the sanctity of Life; limited government; law & order; opportunity for all; & the knowledge that our freedoms are granted by God. I’m proud to have him on my team.""

WHAT GOV. DOUG DUCEY TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT THE ARIZONA GOP PRIMARY FACE-OFF

She emphasized that the former vice president ""has never wavered in his conservative beliefs & commitment to our Constitution, & left a rock-solid legacy as Gov to which I will aspire.""

Both Pence and Trump will be in Arizona on Friday to campaign with the respective candidates they are backing, which will likely lead to split-screen images of the former running mates who may end up facing off against each other in the 2024 GOP presidential nomination race.

Trump will be headlining a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona – about 90 miles north of Phoenix – for Lake as well as three other GOP candidates the former president’s endorsed - venture capitalist Blake Masters for Senate, Abe Hamadeh for Arizona attorney general, and state Rep. Mark Finchem for Arizona secretary of state.

Pence will be teaming up with Robson Taylor for two events – one in the Phoenix area and a border security event near Tucson.

PENCE AND TRUMP HOLD DUELING RALLIES ON EVE OF GEORGIA'S GOP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY

This is Pence’s second high-profile split with Trump in the Republican primaries the past two months. The former vice president endorsed Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and campaigned with the conservative governor outside of Atlanta on the eve of the state’s May 24 primary.

Kemp crushed Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue in the primary. Trump had repeatedly targeted Kemp ever since the governor certified the 2020 election results in Georgia, where Biden narrowly edged Trump in a key battleground state.

TRUMP AND MARYLAND GOV. LARRY HOGAN TRADE FIRE IN GOP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY

Trump has also repeatedly slammed Ducey for a year and a half, after the Arizona governor certified Biden’s razor-thin victory in the southwestern battleground state.

Earlier this month, Ducey made headlines by endorsing Taylor Robson.

""Karrin Taylor Robson is the best conservative in the race for governor,"" Ducey told Fox News last week. ""I've said that I'm going to care very much about who my successor is. And Karrin Taylor Robson is the real deal.""

1142,Gun control advocates stunned man who allegedly shot Indiana mall shooter labeled 'Good Samaritan',Michael Lee,"

Critics are lashing out after a man carrying a pistol stopped a mass shooting at an Indiana shopping mall, arguing the man should not be called a ""Good Samaritan.""

""The term, ‘Good Samaritan’ came from a Bible passage of a man from Samaria who stopped on the side of the road to help a man who was injured and ignored,"" wrote CBS4 traffic anchor Justin Kollar on Twitter Monday. ""I cannot believe we live in a world where the term can equally apply to someone killing someone… my God.""

Kollar's comment comes after a gunman opened fire at a suburban Indianapolis shopping mall on Sunday, killing three people before he was gunned down by a man legally carrying a pistol, under Indiana's new constitutional carry law, according to police. Reports on Monday found that the man who put a halt to the shooting was actually in violation of Greenwood Park Mall policy, which bans the carry of weapons in its facility.

Greenwood Mayor Mark Myers credited the man with saving several lives by killing the shooter, saying they were grateful for his ""quick action and heroism.""

INDIANA SHOPPING MALL SHOOTER SHOT DEAD BY ARMED 'GOOD SAMARITAN,' POLICE SAY

""Someone we are calling the ‘Good Samaritan’ was able to shoot the assailant and stop further bloodshed,"" Meyers said in a statement. ""This person saved lives tonight. On behalf of the City of Greenwood, I am grateful for his quick action and heroism in this situation.""

But some critics joined Kollar in criticizing the man's actions despite him allegedly putting a stop to the mass shooting.

""The Good Samaritan paid for an unknown immigrant's health care out of pocket,"" comedian John Fugelsang wrote on Twitter. ""The Good Samaritan did not shoot anyone. Jesus was not a fan of killing for any reason, including self-defense. But if these ammosexuals had ever read the Bible, they couldn't support the GOP or NRA.""

""I don’t know who needs to hear this but when a 22-year-old illegally brings a loaded gun into a mall and kills a mass shooter armed with an AR-15 after he already killed three people and wounded others is not a ringing endorsement of our implementation of the Second Amendment,"" Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts said on Twitter.

But despite the man's apparent lack of regard for mall rules, his actions were also praised by Greenwood Park Mall representatives.

1144,NYC judge drops murder charge against bodega worker after Manhattan DA backtracks,Danielle Wallace,"

Charges were dropped Tuesday against a New York City bodega worker arrested for the murder of man seen on surveillance video first coming behind the cashier's desk and attacking the employee.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office faced harsh criticism for bringing the charge against Jose Alba earlier this month despite footage suggesting the deadly stabbing was justified as self-defense.

Jennifer Sigall, assistant district attorney under Bragg, issued a motion Tuesday morning to dismiss the second-degree murder charge against Alba and provided a copy to his attorney, Michelle Villasenor-Grant.

Fox News confirmed that a judge dismissed the charge against Alba by Tuesday afternoon.

MANHATTAN BODEGA WORKER CHARGED WITH MURDER WANTED TO AVOID CONFRONTATION, VIDEO SHOWS

""Following an investigation, the People have determined that we cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not justified in his use of deadly physical force. As such, the People will not be presenting the case to a Grand Jury and for the reasons provided in the attached memorandum, hereby move to dismiss the complaint,"" Bragg's office wrote in court documents obtained by Fox News.

Alba repeatedly stabbed Austin Simon behind the counter in the Blue Moon convenience store at 3422 Broadway in Manhattan at approximately 11:00 p.m. on July 1, according to court documents.

The district attorney’s office admitted Tuesday that the ""death stemmed from a physical confrontation that Simon started because he believed that Alba had harshly treated the ten-year-old daughter of Simon's girlfriend.""

Alba had pulled out of the daughter's hand a snack that the girlfriend could not purchase due to a malfunctioning Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Card.

The girlfriend shouted expletives at the clerk and said her boyfriend would be back to ""f*** you up.""

Minutes later, Simon came to the store, entered the small, employees-only area behind the counter, shoved Alba against a wall of shelving, and grabbed him by the collar to lift him out of a chair and force him out of the employees-only area, prosecutors said. He said he wanted Alba to apologize to the girl and to come outside to fight him.

""I don't want a problem, papa,"" Alba is heard on an audio recording telling Simon.

With Simon holding him by the collar and forcibly pushing him out, Alba grabbed a knife from a shelf beside the counter and repeatedly stabbed Simon as they struggled, prosecutors said.

Simon was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The medical examiner said he suffered six sharp force injuries, including one stab wound to the left side of his neck that injured the internal jugular vein.

Alba said Simon's girlfriend also attacked him. Court documents noted that Alba is 61 years old and five-feet-seven-inches tall, while Simon was 35 years old and six feet fall.

Simon had a box cutter visible in his right front shorts but did not display it at any point during the confrontation, according to Alba’s account to police and surveillance video.

Simon was reportedly out on parole for assaulting a police officer at the time of the deadly incident. Alba was arrested and had been held at New York City's infamous jail Riker’s Island on a $250,000 bail – half of the half-million requested by Bragg’s office during an arraignment hearing. Alba was later released after his bail package was reduced to $50,000 before the murder charge was eventually dropped on Tuesday.

The district attorney’s office cited state statute that narrowly defines the circumstances where a deadly physical force, such as homicide, is ""justifiable and not criminal.""

When the defendant raises a defense justification, prosecutors – and not the defendant – are required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt thar the defendant was not justified in the use of deadly physical force. Two different possible justifications are that Alba believed that Simon was about to use deadly physical force against him or that Simon trespassed behind the bodega counter with the intent to commit a crime and Alba’s use of physical force was to prevent or terminate a burglary, prosecutors said.

The ""Colbert 9"" were cleared of ""unlawful entry"" charges Monday after staffers for ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" were caught recording comedy skits inside a House Office Building after hours without permission in June.

A statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office read: ""After a comprehensive review of all of the evidence and the relevant legal authority, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has determined that it cannot move forward with misdemeanor charges of unlawful entry against the nine individuals who were arrested on June 16, 2022 at the Longworth Office Building. The individuals, who entered the building on two separate occasions, were invited by Congressional staffers to enter the building in each instance and were never asked to leave by the staffers who invited them, though, members of the group had been told at various points by the U.S. Capitol Police that they were supposed to have an escort. The Office would be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these invited guests were guilty of the crime of unlawful entry because their escort chose to leave them unattended. We do not believe it is probable that the Office would be able to obtain and sustain convictions on these charges. The defendants no longer will be required to appear for a scheduled hearing in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on July 20, 2022.""

The United States Capitol Police (USCP) released a statement saying they ""respect the decision that office has made"" and referred any questions about the decision to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.

Fox News is told the Capitol Police are upset about the decision to drop the charges, especially since the Colbert 9 were told on multiple occasions they weren’t supposed to be there. Sources close to the Capitol Police also tell Fox this undercuts law enforcement as they try to secure the Capitol complex after the riot.

US CAPITOL POLICE ARREST STEPHEN COLBERT STAFFERS AT HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, CHARGED WITH ILLEGAL ENTRY

In June, a group of nine staffers from CBS’ ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" were arrested after illegally entering a U.S. House of Representatives building. Among those arrested was Robert Smigel, the puppeteer for ""Triumph the Insult Comic Dog,"" a character on Colbert's show, along with writer Josh Comers, associate producer Allison Martinez and senior producer Jake Plunkett.

Fox News was told that the Colbert 9 tried to get permission to cover the Jan. 6 committee hearings but were denied by the House/Senate Radio TV Galleries because they are considered to be entertainment and not news.

According to the police, the staffers were charged with unlawful entry after being found acting ""disruptive, loud"" and ""theatrical"" near the office of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., in the Longworth House Office Building as they recorded comedy skits for the Late Show around 8:30 p.m. on June 16.

Earlier in the day, the group had conducted interviews with members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla, as well as Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass.

They were eventually escorted out of the Cannon House Office Building, where the Jan. 6 committee was conducting its hearing, because they didn't have proper press credentials. Sources tell Fox News that an aide to Auchincloss let them back into the House office buildings around 4:00 p.m. and they were left unattended for several hours.

1146,At least 181 K-12 educators charged with child sex crimes in first half of 2022,Jessica Chasmar,"

At least 181 K-12 educators, including four principals, were arrested on child sex-related crimes in the U.S. in the first six months of 2022, ranging from child pornography to raping students.

An analysis conducted by Fox News Digital looked at local news stories week by week featuring arrests of principals, teachers, substitute teachers and teachers’ aides on child sex-related crimes in school districts across the country. Arrests that weren't publicized were not counted in the analysis, meaning the true number may well be higher.

The analysis found that at least 181 have been arrested between January 1 and June 30, which works out to exactly an arrest a day on average.

The 181 educators included four principals, 153 teachers, 12 teachers' aides and 12 substitute teachers.

AT LEAST 135 TEACHERS, AIDES CHARGED WITH CHILD SEX CRIMES THIS YEAR ALONE

At least 140 of the arrests, or 77%, involved alleged crimes against students.

Men also made up the vast majority – 78% – of the arrests.

Many of the arrests involved especially heinous allegations.

Roger Weaver Freed, the 34-year-old former principal at Williamsport Area High School in Pennsylvania, was arrested in June and charged with sexual contact with a student, corruption of a minor, furnishing liquor to a minor, sexual assault and aggravated indecent assault without consent.

Freed is accused of having a years-long sexual relationship with a male student.

Shannon Hall, a 31-year-old former teacher at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences High School in New York City, was arrested in June and charged with forcible touching, endangering the welfare of a child and aggravated harassment.

Hall is accused of grabbing a 14-year-old female student's breast inside his classroom and of sending texts to a 16-year-old student that said he wanted to have sex with her and threatening to kill her if she told anyone.

Norman Merrill, a 45-year-old former teacher at Green Mountain Union High School in Vermont, was arrested in May and charged with production of child sexual abuse material and possession of child sexual abuse material.

Merrill is accused of secretly video recording female students walking past him at school and of producing videos showing nude children.

Anessa Paige Gower, a 35-year-old former biology teacher at Making Waves Academy in Richmond, California, was charged with 29 counts of child molestation on April 8.

Gower is accused of sexually abusing seven students between 2021-2022 when she was a teacher at Making Waves, with allegations including forcible sodomy of minors and sharing sexually graphic photos over online platforms.

John Doty, a 35-year-old former biology teacher at Career Academy South Bend in Indiana, was charged with two counts of rape, one count of attempted rape and six counts of child seduction on Feb. 9.

Doty is accused of repeatedly raping a 16-year-old female student and threatening to kill her. He is scheduled to stand trial in January 2023.

The analysis comes after the U.S. Department of Education released a report last month, titled, ""Study of State Policies to Prohibit Aiding and Abetting Sexual Misconduct in Schools,"" which analyzed state policies prohibiting ""passing the trash,"" or allowing suspected sexual abusers to quietly leave their jobs to possibly offend again in a different school district.

A bipartisan provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which was originally proposed by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, requires all states receiving federal education funding to enact law prohibiting the practice of ""passing the trash.""

The Education Department’s report, however, found that laws against the practice are varied across the states, and that while all states require prospective employers to conduct criminal background checks on educators, and most states – 46 – require fingerprinting, only 19 states require employers to request information from an applicants’ current and former employers.

Moreover, only 14 states require employers to check an applicant’s eligibility for employment or certification, and 11 require applicants to disclose information regarding investigations or disciplinary actions related to sexual abuse or misconduct.

Toomey, who pressured the Education Department to release its report for months, said he’s ""deeply concerned"" by the findings.

""While I appreciate that the Department of Education has finally fulfilled its obligation to investigate whether states have implemented policies, laws, or regulations to stop the heinous practice of ‘passing the trash,’ I am deeply concerned with these findings,"" Toomey said in a June statement. ""Any educator who engaged in sexual misconduct with a child should be barred from ever teaching in a classroom again, yet too many states do not have policies to ensure that is the case. Releasing this report is only the first step—the department must hold states accountable and use the tools at its disposal to enforce the law.""

Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, called for a new national study on child sex abuse in schools.

""This is a scandal that the political Left is doing everything in its power to suppress,"" he said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The basic fact is incontrovertible: every day, a public school teacher is arrested, indicted, or convicted for child sex abuse. And yet, the teachers unions, the public school bureaucracies, and the left-wing media pretend that the abuse isn't happening and viciously attack families who raise concerns.""

""It's time to take this problem seriously,"" he said. ""I call on Congress to appropriate $25 million for a national study of child sex abuse in public schools, so victims can finally get justice and parents can have greater confidence that schools will be safe for their children.""

The Department of Education last released a report on the topic in 2004, which claimed that nearly 9.6% of students are targets of educator sexual misconduct sometime during their school career.",https://www.foxnews.com
1147,Mayor Bowser claims illegal immigrants crowding DC homeless shelters are asylum seekers 'tricked' onto buses,Lindsay Kornick,"

Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser appeared on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday to discuss the persistent homelessness problem plaguing her city.

Host Margaret Brennan brought up a Washington Post report that suggested homeless shelters are now being filled with illegal immigrants being bused in from Texas and Arizona.

Bowser admitted that it’s a ""significant issue"" and called on the federal government to get more involved as she fears illegal immigrants are being ""tricked"" into traveling to her city.

""Well, this is a very significant issue. We have for sure called on the federal government to work across state lines to prevent people from really being tricked into getting on buses. We think they’re largely asylum seekers who are going to final destinations that are not Washington, D.C. I worked with the White House to make sure that FEMA provided a grant to a local organization that is providing services to folks. I fear that they’re being tricked into nationwide bus trips when their final destinations are places all over the United States of America,"" Bowser said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has sent multiple buses of illegal immigrants to Washington D.C. to manage the growing numbers pouring in from the border. His order to bus migrants to D.C. came after multiple border communities have complained about an influx of illegal immigrants.

After Bowser’s answer, however, Brennan questioned whether local and national taxpayers would be forced to pick up the tab for these migrants. Bowser insisted that neither was true.

""Local taxpayers are not picking up the tab. They should not pick up the tab. We really need a coordinated federal response. We know that it’s done for refugees who come to the states from all points of the world and the same has to be done in the situation,"" Bowser said.

On Friday, a group of 22 House Republicans demanded answers from the Biden administration after reports suggested the federal government had been transporting illegal immigrants throughout the country to receive abortions.

1148,"Mueller witness George Nader pleads guilty to child porn, sex trafficking",Gregg Re,"

A political hobnobber who featured prominently as a key witness in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation faces at least a decade in prison after pleading guilty to charges of child sex trafficking and possessing child pornography.

Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, 60, entered a plea deal Monday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., admitting to transporting a 14-year-old boy from the Czech Republic to Washington, D.C., in 2000 to engage in sexual activity with him. He also admitted to possessing child pornography depicting infants or toddlers.

Nader is still separately under indictment in Washington along with seven others on charges of conspiring to conceal the source of more than $3.5 million in political donations to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Nader allegedly was reporting to an unnamed Middle Eastern government on that operation, which was intended to curry favor with Clinton, prosecutors in that case said.

NADER INDICTED FOR ALLEGEDLY ILLEGALLY FUNNELLING MONEY TO CLINTON

In the meantime, the pornography charge itself carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Prosecutors agreed as part of the plea bargain to recommend a 10-year sentence when Nader is sentenced April 10, although the judge will be free to impose a significantly longer sentence of up to 30 years if she chooses.

Nader's name appears more than 100 times in Mueller's report. It details Nader's efforts to serve as a liaison for a January 2017 meeting between a Russian banker with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and members of President Trump's transition team.

Nader previously served as an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, a close Saudi ally, and in 2017 he wired $2.5 million to a top Trump fundraiser, Elliott Broidy, through a company in Canada. The goal was to persuade the U.S. to take a hard line against Qatar, a longtime American ally but now an adversary of the UAE.

FLASHBACK: NADER IN THE SPOTLIGHT IN MUELLER PROBE

Nader was previously convicted in the Czech Republic of 10 cases of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to a one-year prison term in 2003. In that case, according to Czech court documents, Nader found a boy by cruising an arcade in Prague and lured them in with ""money, jewelry, mobile telephones, clothing, care and housing.""

The 14-year-old boy who was the victim in Monday's guilty plea is a different victim than the ones identified in the Czech case.

Nader also pleaded guilty to a charge of transporting child-pornography images in Virginia in 1991.

The current investigation of Nader began in 2018 when images depicting child pornography and bestiality were found on his phone after it was confiscated under a search warrant connected to the Mueller probe.

The images found in Nader's phones at Dulles International Airport ended up not being the basis for Monday's child-pornography conviction. Instead, prosecutors relied on images and videos he received via email in 2012 that in some cases involved sadistic depictions of infants or toddlers, according to disclosures at Monday's hearing.

In court papers filed Monday, Nader admitted that he discussed child pornography online over the years with an unidentified associated, using the word “wine” as a substitute for child pornography to conceal the nature of the conversations. The two had also worked out a code to add 10 years to the age of persons they referred to in their conversations.

While Nader admitted to transporting the Czech boy to the U.S. for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity, he argues that it happened too long ago to be prosecuted under the statute of limitations, and his plea deal preserves his right to appeal his conviction on that count on those grounds. Even if such an appeal were granted, he would still be subject to a mandatory 10 years on the pornography charge.

1149,Minnesota state lawmaker ends reelection bid amid daughter's allegations of inappropriate touching,Paulina Dedaj,"

Minnesota state Rep. Jim Knoblach announced Friday that he would be ending his reelection campaign amid allegations he inappropriately touched his adult daughter for over 10 years.

The abrupt announcement from the 60-year-old Minnesota Republican came just hours after his attorney denied the allegations in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio.

Knoblach’s 23-year-old daughter, Laura Knoblach, came to the station to tell her story after she said she exhausted all other means.

She alleged that the earliest memory of her father’s inappropriate behavior dates to when she was just 9 years old and continued until she was 21. Her accusations include inappropriate kissing, licking and biting of her ears.

Laura Knoblach told MPR that she recalls her father entering her bedroom after she had gone to sleep. He would climb into her bed and lie down beside her.

""He would put his arm around me and not let me get up or get away and he would lick my neck or bite my ear,"" she told the station.

She alleges other acts, including at least 30 instances where Knoblach approached her from behind in the kitchen and pressed himself up against her, pinning her against the refrigerator or dishwasher.

Laura says she confided in close friends and family and even law enforcement but with no avail.

The St. Cloud Police Department and Sherburne County sheriff's office began an investigation last year but declined to file charges.

She provided extensive documentation to the station about her attempts to get help, which included a letter from the Sherburne County attorney's office saying there was ""insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Jim Knoblach had committed a crime.""

The St. Cloud Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment regarding why charges were not filed.

Knoblach vehemently denied the allegations.

In a written statement he said that his daughter “has been estranged from our family for some time.”

""In late 2016 she made some extremely hurtful and untrue accusations on a Facebook post, which was briefly put up and then taken down. These accusations were fully investigated by Sherburne County, dismissed, and the case closed in April 2017,” his statement read.

Knoblach did not return multiple attempts by Fox News for a comment.

As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and in a hotly sought after seat, Knoblach’s departure will make it difficult for Republicans to hold a write-in campaign by a substitute candidate.

It is likely that Dan Wolgamott of St. Cloud, the Democratic candidate, will win the election.

1150,"Former lawmaker facing sex abuse probe was 'coward' for killing himself, ex-wife says",Lukas Mikelionis,"

The former Idaho state lawmaker who was found dead Tuesday was under apparent investigation for allegedly molesting two girls, according to details that emerged Wednesday.

Brandon Hixon, 36, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, authorities said. Officials did not disclose more details, except that the suicide may have been related to possible sexual abuse allegations.

But in a report published Wednesday, the former wife of the three-term Republican – who resigned from the Idaho Legislature in October amid a sexual abuse probe – said Hixon was investigated over sexual abuse of two girls, including a young female relative whom she says was abused for more than a decade.

Danielle Eirvin Hixon, who was married to the former lawmaker for 10 years until their divorce in 2016, said she was encouraged to speak out after seeing other praising her ex-husband’s character and wanted people to know the other side of the story.

'He would cheat on me'

“Brandon made people believe that he was a stand-up, morally correct person,” she said. “But behind the house walls, he would cheat on me and molested children.”

She said investigators asked her not to disclose details about the allegations until charges were filed against her former husband. She and two other people had been scheduled to testify before a grand jury Wednesday.

“I had no idea it was happening,” the ex-wife added about the alleged abuse, noting that the girl who told her “kept it quiet for so long.”

The other alleged victim of sexual abuse is not related to the lawmaker, the woman said. She learned about her allegations from the victim’s mother.

Speaking about the suicide, she branded her ex-husband a “coward” for taking his life rather than facing justice and giving closure to the victims.

“I say he was a coward by taking the easy way out,” Hixon said.

'Running to the press'

But the public statements from the ex-wife caused upset to the grieving family. Kayle Olson, the lawmaker’s sister, criticized the ex-wife for “already running to the press” about the allegations.

“Danielle has brought forth many allegations. She has put the minor children on the front line of this tragic battle when they should have not ever been,” Olson told the Idaho Statesman. “This should have remained private and not exposed by her in the manner it has been.”

She added: “This is a sealed case with minors involved and the children need to be thought of first, which she has completely failed to do,” she added.

“The family is grieving. We would wish that everyone respect that at this time. This has been a very tragic and devastating case for everyone involved. It is very real for us. It is not a joke to us. Somebody is dead.”

The former wife told the Statesman that one of the victims, who is now a teenager, allowed her to speak about the alleged sexual abuse.

1152,Ex-Oklahoma state senator gets 15-year prison sentence for child sex trafficking,Kathleen Joyce,"

A former Republican state senator in Oklahoma was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison Monday for child sex trafficking.

Ralph Shortey, 36, was also ordered to serve 10 years of supervised probation once he's released from prison.

U.S. District Judge Timothy DeGiusti also said a fine -- which could be as much as $250,000 -- will be imposed on the former two-term lawmaker at a later date.

Shortey appeared in court and made a statement saying he “hoped the sentencing will be closure to those involved,” FOX25 News reported.

Shortey pleaded guilty in November in exchange for prosecutors dropping three child pornography charges against him. He said at the time the plea deal was in the best interest of him and his family.

OKLAHOMA POLICE RELEASE BODY CAM FOOTAGE OF FORMER STATE SENATOR CAUGHT WITH UNDERAGE MALE

The former state senator, who represented southwest Oklahoma City, was arrested in March 2017 after police caught him in a hotel room with a 17-year-old male. Police said they went to the room after receiving a welfare check call placed by the teen boy's father. The officer said police smelled marijuana coming from the room.

Shortey, a father of four, was accused by officers of hiring the teenage boy for sex. He resigned shortly after the arrest and his wife obtained a divorce earlier this year.

The Moore Police Department released body camera footage of Shortey in the hotel room with the boy. He told officers he and the teenager were having a conversation in the room.

A police report indicated a search of the teen's tablet computer uncovered a series of sexually explicit exchanges in which Shortey referred to him as ""baby boy"" and offered him cash in exchange for “sexual stuff.”

OKLAHOMA STATE SENATOR CHARGED IN CHILD PROSTITUTION CASE

The FBI became involved in the case following Shortey's arrest and searched his Oklahoma City home. The FBI discovered Shortey had previously used fake names to send and receive child pornography and to go on Craigslist to seek casual encounters with males, the “younger the better.”
